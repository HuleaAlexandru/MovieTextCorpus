{0:6:51 - 0:9:28} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He rises, and in QUICK CUTS: he dresses; he moves down the hall, stops at the door of his father's bedroom and sees the undisturbed bed.

{0:6:51 - 0:9:28} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The farmers glance up at William, their faces grim...
{0:6:51 - 0:9:28} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: From his perch in the loft, William sees that the neighbors have brought: the bodies of his father and brother.
{0:6:51 - 0:9:28} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The cart stops; Campbell, with a bandage around his left hand where more of his fingers are now missing, studies the back of the ox, as if it could tell him how to break such news.
{0:6:51 - 0:9:28} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The butt of the ox seems to tell him to be matter-of-fact.
{0:6:51 - 0:9:28} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CAMPBELL
{0:9:24 - 0:9:28} {DIALOGUE}: William... Come down here, lad.
{0:9:24 - 0:13:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William looks away, he takes quick breaths, he looks back... but the bodies are still there.

{0:9:24 - 0:13:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cloths around the lower jaw and top of the head bind their mouths shut; pennies cover their eyes.
{0:9:24 - 0:13:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Softly, William enters the shed, drawn to his father and brother.
{0:9:24 - 0:13:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Campbell follows him in, wanting to stop him -- but what can he say now?
{0:9:24 - 0:13:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The undertaker goes on with his work.
{0:9:24 - 0:13:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William approaches the table; the bodies don't look real to him.

{0:9:24 - 0:13:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The sight of the boy, standing alone in front of the graves of his dead mother, as the bodies of his father and brother are lowered with ropes into the ground beside her, has all of the neighbors shaken.
{0:9:24 - 0:13:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The local parish PRIEST drones mechanically in Latin.
{0:9:24 - 0:13:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The farmers who were secretly gathered in Malcolm Wallace's kitchen the previous night are now glancing at William; but no one is anxious to adopt a grieving, a rebellious boy.
{0:9:24 - 0:13:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Behind MacClannough are his wife and two daughters; his youngest is barely four, not half William's age; she's a beautiful girl with long auburn hair, and she clings to her own mother's hand, as if the open graves are the mouths of death and might suck her parents in too.
{0:9:24 - 0:13:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PRIEST
{0:9:24 - 0:13:30} {DIALOGUE}: ...Restare in pacem eternis, Amen.
{0:9:24 - 0:13:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With the final Amen, the neighbors drift from the graveside, pulling their Children along, to give William a last moment of private grief before the grave diggers cover the bodies.
{0:9:24 - 0:13:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The boy stands alone over the open graves, his heart so shattered that he can scarcely cry; a single tear makes its way down his face.
{0:9:24 - 0:13:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And the tiny girl feels for William in a way that the adults cannot.
{0:9:24 - 0:13:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: From the ground she pulls a Scottish thistle, moves to the softly weeping William and places the beautiful wild blossom in his hand.
{0:9:24 - 0:13:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William looks up and their young eyes meet; her sad blue eyes hold William's as the grave diggers cover the bodies.
{0:9:24 - 0:13:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then a lone, mounted figure appears at the crest of the hill above them.
{0:9:24 - 0:13:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Tall, thin and angular, in black clerical garb, he looks like the grim reaper.
{0:9:24 - 0:13:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The girl hurries back to her mother's side; everyone watches in silence as the figure rides down to them.
{0:9:24 - 0:13:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is ARGYLE WALLACE.

{0:19:48 - 0:20:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She glances at Edward, and at the young man with him, then lowers her eyes and starts to back out.

{0:19:48 - 0:20:8} {DIALOGUE}: Look at me.
{0:19:48 - 0:20:8} {DIALOGUE}: I said LOOK AT ME!
{0:19:48 - 0:20:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She lifts her eyes.
{0:19:48 - 0:20:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But she could not brace herself enough for what she sees: Edward nuzzling Phillip, the prince's bare chest to his muscular friend's bare back, both men glistening with sweat and sexual excitement.
{0:19:48 - 0:20:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Princess's eyes quiver... but she does not look away.
{0:19:48 - 0:20:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:19:48 - 0:20:8} {DIALOGUE}: Now, my flower, do you understand?
{0:19:48 - 0:20:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PRINCESS
{0:19:48 - 0:20:8} {DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{0:19:48 - 0:20:8} {DIALOGUE}: I had thought that... I was loathsome to you.
{0:19:48 - 0:20:8} {DIALOGUE}: Perhaps I am.
{0:19:48 - 0:20:8} {DIALOGUE}: If I may be excused, M'lord.
{0:19:48 - 0:20:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:19:48 - 0:20:8} {DIALOGUE}: You may.
{0:19:48 - 0:20:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She starts to leave, as quietly as she came.
{0:19:48 - 0:20:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But her husband calls after her.
{0:19:48 - 0:20:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:19:48 - 0:20:8} {DIALOGUE}: Don't worry, m'Lady, it is my royal responsibility to breed.

{0:20:23 - 0:20:31} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAIG

{0:20:26 - 0:20:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORNAY
{0:20:26 - 0:20:35} {DIALOGUE}: The Balliol clan has endorsed the right, licking Longshanks' boots so he will support their claim to the throne.
{0:20:26 - 0:20:35} {DIALOGUE}: If we make a show of opposition, the commoners will favor us.
{0:20:26 - 0:20:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ROBERT
{0:20:26 - 0:20:35} {DIALOGUE}: It is too soon to step out alone.
{0:20:31 - 0:20:35} {DIALOGUE}: My father believes we must lull Longshanks into confidence, by neither supporting his decree nor opposing it.
{0:20:31 - 0:20:42} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAIG
{0:20:38 - 0:20:42} {DIALOGUE}: A wise plan.
{0:20:38 - 0:20:42} {DIALOGUE}: And how is your father?
{0:20:38 - 0:20:42} {DIALOGUE}: We have missed him at the council.
{0:20:38 - 0:20:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ROBERT
{0:20:38 - 0:20:55} {DIALOGUE}: He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride.
{0:20:52 - 0:20:55} {DIALOGUE}: But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces.
{0:20:55 - 0:20:59} {DIALOGUE}: And for Scotland.
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. SCOTTISH VILLAGE, AT THE EDGE OF TOWN - DAY
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Flutes and dancing; laughter and garlands; village families have gathered for a wedding celebration -- we see the happy bride and groom.
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Farmers cart in fresh bread and hoops of cheese; villagers arrive with casks of beer or strings of smoked fish.
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And watching the people are ubiquitous English soldiers, battlescarred veterans with missing eyes and ears.
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riding along the road comes William Wallace.
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Grown now, a man.
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He sits his horse as if born there, his back straight, his hands relaxed on the reins.
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He has a look of lean, rippled power.
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks dangerous.
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And the soldiers notice him, nudging each other as he passes.
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He carries a dead wild goose hanging across his saddle; he stops his horse at the edge of the clearing and surveys the scene.
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Farmers are roasting a pig; women are comparing handiwork; young men are tossing huge stones in the traditional Highland games -- and everyone is noticing William's arrival, especially the farm women with daughters of marriageable age.
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Among those watching William arrive is Campbell, grown older now; and with his old rebel friend, MacClannough.
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William dismounts and ties his horse to a willow.
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: One of the English SOLDIERS shoves William from behind.
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLDIER
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {DIALOGUE}: Hey boy!
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {DIALOGUE}: You hunt this bird?
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William's eyes fix themselves on the soldier.
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLDIER
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {DIALOGUE}: It's against the law for Scots to own bows.
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {DIALOGUE}: You shot this bird?
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His buddies, enjoying their role as intimidators, grab the bird and begin to search it for evidence.
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{0:20:55 - 0:23:14} {DIALOGUE}: I hit it in the head.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {DIALOGUE}: With a rock.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They don't believe that -- but they can't find any puncture wound on the bird.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William reaches his hand out for the return of the bird.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The soldiers drop it onto the ground.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Slowly, William picks it up, and heads into the clearing.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The farmers watch him come.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Among those noticing William's arrival, but pretending not to, is MARION MacCLANNOUGH, grown now into a stunning young woman; her long auburn hair reminds us of those years long ago; she wears it the same way, straight and full down her back.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her dress is plain, like the grass that surrounds a wildflower.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She's the most beautiful girl in the village, maybe in all of Scotland, and the soldiers who hassled William notice her too.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William reaches the food table and contributes his goose to the feast.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: FARM WOMEN eye him; he nodes to one.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {DIALOGUE}: Miz MacDougal.

{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {DIALOGUE}: ...William?
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {DIALOGUE}: It's William Wallace, back home!
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {DIALOGUE}: -- Have you met my daughter?
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The daughter mentioned is missing teeth.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William nods to her.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's impossible for him to giver her a smile as bright as her hopes, and she lowers her head in disappointment.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But then raises her face in surprise as William takes her hand and gives her a respectful bow.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He moves away from the table, passing through the crowd like a stranger.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he glances toward the knot of girls.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He sees Marion.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She sees him, then looks away.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Do they remember each other?
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He moves toward her; she is shy, her eyes downcast, but then she raises them and looks at him.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They move closer and closer together.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just as they are about to reach each other, a huge round stone THUMPS to the earth at Williams' feet.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks up to see one of Marion's suitors -- the broad, muscled young man who has just tossed the stone in William's way.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now everybody's looking to see how William will handle the challenge.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He tries to move around, but the guy cuts him off.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then William thinks he recognizes the big red-head.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {DIALOGUE}: Hamish?
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is his old friend, but Hamish won't admit it, or be put off from the challenge.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He points to the huge stone.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMISH
{0:23:9 - 0:23:14} {DIALOGUE}: Test of manhood.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:17} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{0:23:14 - 0:23:17} {DIALOGUE}: You win.
{0:23:14 - 0:23:20} {CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMISH
{0:23:14 - 0:23:20} {META_DATA}: (blocks him)
{0:23:17 - 0:23:20} {DIALOGUE}: Call it a test of soldiery, then.
{0:23:20 - 0:23:24} {DIALOGUE}: The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
{0:23:20 - 0:23:28} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{0:23:24 - 0:23:28} {DIALOGUE}: The test of a soldier is not in his arm.
{0:23:28 - 0:23:31} {DIALOGUE}: It's here.
{0:23:28 - 0:23:31} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He taps his temple.
{0:23:28 - 0:23:31} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hamish stretches out his hand, as if to show William something in his palm.
{0:23:28 - 0:23:31} {CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMISH
{0:23:28 - 0:23:31} {DIALOGUE}: No.
{0:23:28 - 0:23:31} {DIALOGUE}: It's here.
{0:23:28 - 0:24:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With a sudden movement, he slams his fist into William's jaw, dropping him.
{0:23:28 - 0:24:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A few men move to interfere, but Campbell, MacClannough, and the other farmers who are the true leaders here, stop their neighbors from interrupting.
{0:23:28 - 0:24:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hamish stands over William, waiting for him to get up.
{0:23:28 - 0:24:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{0:23:28 - 0:24:22} {DIALOGUE}: A contest, then.
{0:23:28 - 0:24:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William stands and hoists the huge stone, eighteen inches in diameter.
{0:23:28 - 0:24:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Straining with the effort, he lugs the stone to the line scratched in the rocky field.
{0:23:28 - 0:24:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beyond the line are the muddy dents from previous tosses.
{0:23:28 - 0:24:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William takes a run and heaves the stone.
{0:23:28 - 0:24:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It flies past the other marks in the field; people are impressed.
{0:23:28 - 0:24:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William looks at Hamish.
{0:23:28 - 0:24:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{0:23:28 - 0:24:22} {DIALOGUE}: I still say this is no test.
{0:23:28 - 0:24:22} {DIALOGUE}: A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
{0:23:28 - 0:24:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMISH
{0:23:28 - 0:24:22} {DIALOGUE}: That depends on the man.
{0:23:28 - 0:24:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hamish walks out, lifts the stone, and lugs it back to the line.
{0:23:28 - 0:24:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes a run and heaves with a great groan!
{0:23:28 - 0:24:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The stone flies, passing William's mark by a couple of feet.
{0:23:28 - 0:24:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: People laugh and whistle.
{0:23:28 - 0:24:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William nods, impressed.
{0:23:28 - 0:24:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{0:24:18 - 0:24:22} {DIALOGUE}: Can you do it when it matters?
{0:24:25 - 0:24:28} {DIALOGUE}: As it matters in battle?
{0:24:28 - 0:24:30} {DIALOGUE}: Could you crush a man with that throw?
{0:24:28 - 0:24:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMISH
{0:24:31 - 0:24:34} {DIALOGUE}: I could crush you like a roach.
{0:24:31 - 0:24:40} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William walks to the dent made by Hamish's throw.
{0:24:31 - 0:24:40} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{0:24:38 - 0:24:40} {DIALOGUE}: Then do it.
{0:24:47 - 0:24:49} {DIALOGUE}: Come, do it.
{0:24:47 - 0:24:49} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hamish scowls at William, at everybody watching.
{0:24:47 - 0:24:49} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He lifts the stone and carries it back to the line.
{0:24:47 - 0:24:49} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William stands calmly.
{0:24:47 - 0:24:49} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hamish backs up for his run.
{0:24:47 - 0:24:49} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William yawns.
{0:24:47 - 0:24:49} {CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMISH
{0:24:47 - 0:24:49} {DIALOGUE}: You'll move
{0:24:47 - 0:24:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{0:24:49 - 0:24:52} {DIALOGUE}: I will not.
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hamish backs up a few more feet, for a longer run.
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: FARMER STEWART
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {DIALOGUE}: That's not fair!
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CAMPBELL
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {DIALOGUE}: He's tired, he should get a longer run.
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William seems completely unafraid.
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He leans down, picks up a small smooth stone and tosses it up in the air casually.
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Stung by this show of calm, Hamish takes furious run, and heaves!
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The stone flies through the air, just misses William's head, and buries itself halfway into the earth behind him.
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William never flinches.
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The people cheer.
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CAMPBELL
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {DIALOGUE}: Brave show!
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hamish is miffed; it's like William won.
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMISH
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {DIALOGUE}: I threw longer than last time!
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CAMPBELL
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {DIALOGUE}: An ox is strong, but not clever.
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMISH
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {DIALOGUE}: An ox is stupid enough to just stand in one place.
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {DIALOGUE}: That's not the point.
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William turns, walks double the distance Hamish threw, and turns and hurls the rock he holds!
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It whistles through the air, hits Hamish in the forehead, and drops him like a shot.
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {DIALOGUE}: That is.
{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everybody cheers and laughs!

{0:24:49 - 0:25:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CAMPBELL

{0:25:22 - 0:25:45} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William takes a tankard of ale from a farmer, walks over and tosses the cold liquid into Hamish's face; he wakes, and, his eyes uncrossing, accepts William's hand, pulling him up.
{0:25:22 - 0:25:45} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{0:25:40 - 0:25:45} {DIALOGUE}: Good to see you again.
{0:25:40 - 0:26:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMISH

{0:25:40 - 0:26:33} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William walks to the knot of young ladies... but passes Marion, and moves to the girl with the missing teeth.
{0:25:40 - 0:26:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM

{0:25:40 - 0:26:33} {DIALOGUE}: Their cart turned over.
{0:25:40 - 0:26:33} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The musicians interrupt their playing; a group of heavily armed horsemen, with banners and flying colors, ride up, reining their horses into the middle of the celebration.
{0:25:40 - 0:26:33} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In the middle of the group is an English NOBLEMAN; he is gray, in his fifties, and stops in front of the BRIDE and groom.
{0:25:40 - 0:26:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NOBLEMAN

{0:41:8 - 0:42:26} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The scarred soldier pulls Marion into his big arms; she shoves him away with surprising strength, and he staggers back, to the laughter of his friends.
{0:41:8 - 0:42:26} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he snatches her again and kisses her hard on the lips.
{0:41:8 - 0:42:26} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She breaks free and SLAPS him fiercely, hard enough to draw blood from his mouth.
{0:41:8 - 0:42:26} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Tasting the trickle, he slings her down against sacks of grain, and the soldiers are all over her, pinning her down, ripping her clothes, a full scale public gang rape.
{0:41:8 - 0:42:26} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the townspeople try to move in the three soldiers waiting their turn at Marion pull their knives, keep them townspeople back.

{0:42:22 - 0:43:13} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He slams his mouth down against hers for a long, awful time, comes up clawing at her dress to rip it from her body... and is hit in the face by a rock thrown at great speed!
{0:42:22 - 0:43:13} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It takes a moment for the other soldiers to realize what just happened, and in that instant William is on them.
{0:42:22 - 0:43:13} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He wrenches one soldier's arm in a direction it was never meant to go, breaking the elbow, separating the shoulder, and slinging the howling soldier into his comrades.
{0:42:22 - 0:43:13} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Two of the soldiers leap at William, swinging their short swords; William ducks, knocking their ale cask into their knees; William lifts the whole table where they were sitting and slams it into the faces of two more attackers.

{0:43:10 - 0:45:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He slaps the horse's rump and it plunges with Marion into the twisting village lanes.
{0:43:10 - 0:45:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William darts off through the crowd, as the MAGISTRATE and more of his soldiers arrive -- dozens of them!
{0:43:10 - 0:45:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William pauses out in the central street of the village, just long enough to be sure they've spotted him, and darts into a side lane in the opposite direction Marion went; William weaves through the narrow streets of the medieval town, knocking over baskets, jumping carts.
{0:43:10 - 0:45:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the soldiers stumble after him, the Magistrate looks down at his mangled soldiers.
{0:43:10 - 0:45:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The one with the ruptured arm is lying in agony.

{0:43:10 - 0:45:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The shout rings through the village; Marion hears it, and when she sees more soldiers at the far end of the lane she's trying to take out of town, she urges the horse into an even narrower back alley.
{0:43:10 - 0:45:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She sees a clear route to freedom...
{0:43:10 - 0:45:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But the flock of pigeons pecking on the scraps thrown there behind the shops rise into the horse's face with a sudden thrashing of wings, and the horse shies against a wall.
{0:43:10 - 0:45:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Marion controls him, but a flap of her ripped dress has caught on a crude nail, and as the frightened horse lunges forward again, she is pulled off its bare back, her dress catching and ripping at the same time, dropping her hard.
{0:43:10 - 0:45:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WILLIAM
{0:43:10 - 0:45:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: reaches the edge of the town and slips into the trees by the river; the soldiers are running every which way, but they've lost him.

{0:43:10 - 0:45:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: IN THE TOWN, MARION

{0:43:10 - 0:45:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MAGISTRATE
{0:45:39 - 0:45:43} {DIALOGUE}: An assault on the king's soldiers is the same as assaulting the king!

{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hamish moves reluctantly, forcing himself forward; as he reaches the grove, William appears, hurrying out to him.
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We STAY IN THE LONG SHOT, seeing William asking anxiously for any news, and seeing Hamish's great shoulders as he tells him something that makes William step backwards...

{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At a barrier across the main road into the center of the village are twenty professional soldiers, entrenched, fully armed -- bows, pikes, swords.

{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE ENGLISH SOLDIERS' POV - WALLACE, ON HIS HORSE
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He has stopped, rock still.
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The soldiers hush; there is something unsettling about this man alone, staring at the twenty of them, as if to steel himself for the butchery.
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wallace raises his sword, screams... and charges!
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. VARIOUS ANGLES - LANARK VILLAGE - DAY - THE FIGHT
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We FAVOR WALLACE'S SUBJECTIVE POV: the barrier as his horse pounds toward it, the faces of the enemy soldiers with their eyes white with fear... They stand to shoot at him with their bows; the arrows WHISH toward the lens, fly past...
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The arrows tear through Wallace's clothes, but don't catch his flesh.
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He charges on; his horse LEAPS the barrier as Wallace simultaneously swings the broadsword -- and he's more than an expert: the tip, at the end of a huge arc, nearly breaks the sound barrier and the blade bites through the corporal's helmet, taking off the upper half of his head!
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The soldiers try to rally, to shoot him in the back as his horse leaps over them.
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: One of them has sighted William's back... But Hamish and his father crash into them!
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's a wild fight; old Campbell takes an arrow through the shoulder but keeps hacking with his sword; Hamish batters down two men -- and more Scots arrive!

{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Soldiers pop up; the first he gallops straight over; the next he whacks forehand, like a polo player; the next chops down on his left side; every time he swings the broadsword, a man dies.
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wallace gallops on; his farmer neighbors, and people from the village, follow in his wake.
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. IN THE VILLAGE - DAY

{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The see Wallace gallop into sight; but he stops, then heads down a side street.
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Magistrate and his men don't like this; where did he go?
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Which way will he come from?
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then they hear the horses, and see the other Scots, at the head of the main street.

{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are loading to fire again when Wallace runs in -- on foot!
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -- and cuts down two soldiers!
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The other Scots charge!
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The startled soldiers break and run in every direction.
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Magistrate, abandoned, runs too.
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wallace pursues.

{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the Scots see Wallace, they break off pursuing the English soldiers and stop to watch; dragging the Magistrate by his hair, Wallace hauls him back into the village square, slams him against the well, and stands over him with heaving lungs and wild eyes, staring at Marion's murderer.
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MAGISTRATE
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {DIALOGUE}: Please.

{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE STAIN OF BLOOD
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Marion's blood, in a dark dry splash by the wall of the well, the stain dripping down onto the dirt of the street.
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wallace spins, jerks back the Magistrate's head, and cuts his throat with the sword.
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ON THE OTHER SCOTS
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Silenced by what they've just seen and done.

{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William staggers a few steps, and collapses to his knees.
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then not just the Scottish farmers but the townspeople too begin a strange, Hi-Lo chant.
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CROWD
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {DIALOGUE}: AHHHHHHH-UHHHHHH!

{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And there in the dirt beside the well, he sees the severed cloth strip he gave to Marion, now stained with her blood.
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He lifts it, crushes it in his hand, as the Highlanders chant for war.
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. LANARK VILLAGE - NIGHT
{0:46:1 - 0:56:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The villagers are still excited by what just happened; at the blacksmith's forge, men tend to Campbell's wound...

{0:56:30 - 0:57:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SHOUTS of alarm: ARMED MEN are coming!
{0:56:30 - 0:57:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The farmers scramble for their weapons, ready to fight; even Campbell jumps up; but what they see coming out of the darkness are twenty more farmers, with hayhooks, knives, axes, anything they could find for weapons.

{1:12:18 - 1:13:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Farmers in the field, blacksmiths at their forges, leave their work and uncover their inevitable weapons and run after the riders.

{1:12:18 - 1:13:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The mists of morning shroud most of the field.
{1:12:18 - 1:13:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But from the opposite side of the bridge they hear the CLATTERING of a huge army moving forward.

{1:12:18 - 1:13:11} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LOCHLAN

{1:12:18 - 1:13:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As through the mists they see the numbers arrayed against them, a YOUNG SOLDIER tugs at a grizzled VETERAN.

{1:13:9 - 1:13:11} {DIALOGUE}: The nobles will negotiate.
{1:13:9 - 1:13:17} {DIALOGUE}: If they deal, they send us home.
{1:13:15 - 1:13:17} {DIALOGUE}: If not, we charge.
{1:13:15 - 1:14:29} {DIALOGUE}: When we are all dead and they can call themselves brave, they withdraw.
{1:13:15 - 1:14:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: YOUNG SOLDIER
{1:14:25 - 1:14:29} {DIALOGUE}: I didn't come to fight so they could own more lands that I could work for them!
{1:14:25 - 1:14:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VETERAN

{1:15:0 - 1:15:58} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORNAY
{1:15:0 - 1:15:58} {DIALOGUE}: They won't stop -- and who could blame them?
{1:15:0 - 1:15:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, riding into the mob of men, comes Wallace, followed by his friends.
{1:15:0 - 1:15:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's striking, charismatic, his powerful arms bare, his chest covered not in armor but a commoner's leather shirt, and unlike the heavy knights on their armored horses, Wallace rides a swift horse, like he was born on it.
{1:15:0 - 1:15:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The entire Scottish army watches in fascination as Wallace and his men ride through them, toward the command hill.

{1:16:41 - 1:16:42} {DIALOGUE}: And if this is your army, why does it go?
{1:16:41 - 1:16:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wallace reins his horse around to face the mob of sullen men, now frightened, ready to desert.
{1:16:41 - 1:16:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We play this picture, Wallace sitting his horse, looking down in awe at this thing that has grown beyond anyone's imagination.
{1:16:41 - 1:16:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He glances at his friends: Campbell, Hamish, Stephen.
{1:16:41 - 1:16:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They've got no suggestions, they're just as awed as he is.
{1:16:41 - 1:16:44} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTTISH VETERAN

{1:16:42 - 1:16:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHOUTS FROM MOB
{1:16:49 - 1:16:53} {DIALOGUE}: Home!

{1:17:11 - 1:17:25} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WALLACE
{1:17:22 - 1:17:25} {DIALOGUE}: I am William Wallace.
{1:17:22 - 1:17:30} {DIALOGUE}: And my enemies do not go away.
{1:17:22 - 1:17:30} {DIALOGUE}: I saw our good nobles hanged.
{1:17:22 - 1:17:30} {DIALOGUE}: My wife... I am William Wallace.
{1:17:27 - 1:17:30} {DIALOGUE}: And I see a whole army of my countrymen, here in defiance of tyranny.
{1:17:36 - 1:17:40} {DIALOGUE}: You have come to fight as free men.
{1:17:40 - 1:17:44} {DIALOGUE}: And free men you are!
{1:17:45 - 1:17:49} {DIALOGUE}: What will you do with freedom?
{1:17:49 - 1:17:51} {DIALOGUE}: Will you fight?
{1:17:49 - 1:18:1} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VETERAN
{1:17:49 - 1:18:1} {DIALOGUE}: Two thousand, against ten?

{1:18:1 - 1:19:36} {DIALOGUE}: Run and you will live, at least awhile.
{1:18:1 - 1:19:36} {DIALOGUE}: And dying in your bed many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that, for one chance to come back here as young men, and tell our enemies that they make take our lives, but they will never take our freedom?
{1:18:1 - 1:19:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Down on the plain, English emissaries in all their regal finery gallop over the bridge, under a banner of truce.
{1:18:1 - 1:19:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VETERAN
{1:18:1 - 1:19:36} {DIALOGUE}: Look!
{1:18:1 - 1:19:36} {DIALOGUE}: The English comes to barter with our nobles for castles and titles.
{1:18:1 - 1:19:36} {DIALOGUE}: And our nobles will not be in the front of the battle!
{1:18:1 - 1:19:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WALLACE
{1:18:1 - 1:19:36} {DIALOGUE}: No!

{1:19:36 - 1:20:2} {DIALOGUE}: Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.

{1:19:36 - 1:20:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mornay reins his horse over, lifts the reins of Wallace's horse, and extends them to him: an invitation to join the pre-battle talks.

{1:19:36 - 1:20:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: OUT ON THE FIELD, THE TWO GROUPS OF RIDERS

{1:19:58 - 1:20:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CHELTHAM
{1:20:5 - 1:20:7} {DIALOGUE}: Here are the King's terms.
{1:20:19 - 1:20:24} {DIALOGUE}: Lead this army off the field, and he will give you each estates in Yorkshire, including hereditary title, from which you will pay him an annual --
{1:20:19 - 1:20:27} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WALLACE

{1:20:24 - 1:20:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CHELTHAM

{1:20:31 - 1:20:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LOCHLAN

{1:20:37 - 1:20:40} {DIALOGUE}: Absolutely.

{1:20:46 - 1:20:52} {DIALOGUE}: Lower your flags and march straight to England, stopping at every Scottish home you pass to beg forgiveness for a hundred years of theft, rape, and murder.

{1:20:55 - 1:21:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CHELTHAM
{1:21:6 - 1:21:9} {DIALOGUE}: You are outmatched!
{1:21:6 - 1:21:12} {DIALOGUE}: You haven't even any cavalry!

{1:21:23 - 1:21:41} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORNAY
{1:21:37 - 1:21:41} {DIALOGUE}: I'd say that was rather less cordial that he was used to.
{1:21:37 - 1:21:44} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WALLACE
{1:21:41 - 1:21:44} {DIALOGUE}: Be ready, and do exactly as I say.
{1:21:41 - 1:22:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They return to the Scottish lines.
{1:21:41 - 1:22:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wallace dismounts where his men are breaking out new 14-foot spears.

{1:21:41 - 1:22:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMISH
{1:21:41 - 1:22:29} {DIALOGUE}: Wish I could see the noble lord's face when he tells him.

{1:21:41 - 1:22:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The husky English commander's blood boils from Cheltham's report.
{1:21:41 - 1:22:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Before he can respond, they see WALLACE'S SPEARMEN taking up a position on the far side of the bridge.

{1:22:24 - 1:22:29} {DIALOGUE}: Full attack!

{1:22:24 - 1:24:39} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. THE FIELD BELOW STIRLING CASTLE - DAY
{1:22:24 - 1:24:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The English army moves forward toward the bridge.
{1:22:24 - 1:24:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's so narrow that only a single file of riders can move across it at any one time.
{1:22:24 - 1:24:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The English heavy cavalry, two hundred knights, cross uncontested, and form up on the other side.
{1:22:24 - 1:24:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WITH WALLACE AND THE SCOTS

{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GENERAL
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {DIALOGUE}: M'lord, the bridge is so narrow --
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TALMADGE
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {DIALOGUE}: The Scots just stand in their formations!
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Our cavalry will ride them down like grass.
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Get the infantry across so they can finish the slaughter!

{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Talmadge gestures for the attack flag.
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE CAVALRY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The English knights see the signal banners, telling them to attack.
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They take the lances from their squires, and lower the visors of their helmets.
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Proud, plumed, glimmering; they look invincible.
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Their huge horses, themselves draped in scarlet and purple, look like tanks.
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The knights charge!
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Their hooves THUNDER; the horses are so heavy the ground literally shakes with the charge.
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Scots stand and watch them come on.
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's difficult to imagine the courage this takes; from the POV OF THE SCOTTISH LINES we see the massive horses boring in... we feel the RISING THUNDER of the charge, closer, closer...
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wallace moves to the front of the lead group of Scots.
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WALLACE
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {DIALOGUE}: Steady!

{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WALLACE
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {DIALOGUE}: FORM!
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now the spearmen snap the spears forward in ranks, the first line of men bracing their spears at an angle three feet above the ground, the men behind them bracing theirs at a five foot level, the men behind that bracing at seven feet.
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The English knights have never seen such a formation.
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Their lances are useless and it's too late to stop!
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The momentum that was to carry the horses smashing through the men on foot now becomes suicidal force; knights and horses impale themselves on the long spears like beef on skewers.
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: TALMADGE
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: can see it; but worse is the SOUND, the SCREAMS OF DYING MEN AND HORSES, carried to him across the battlefield.
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WALLACE AND HIS MEN
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: are protected, behind a literal wall of fallen chargers and knights.
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wallace draws his broadsword and leads his swordsmen out onto the field, attacking the knights that are still alive.
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Most are off their horses; a few have managed to pull up their mounts.
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wallace and his men are so much more mobile than the knights; the field runs with blood.
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wallace faces Talmadge in the distance.
{1:24:39 - 1:25:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WALLACE

{1:33:10 - 1:33:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At the rear of the hall is a balcony, backed by a magnificent sunlit stained glass window, and in the center of its rainbow corona he sees a familiar form: Marion, so real to him in this moment of triumph that he can see her, glowing like an angel, in a gown worthy of the occasion.

{1:35:12 - 1:35:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He brandishes the broadsword.
{1:35:12 - 1:35:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WALLACE

{1:36:7 - 1:36:20} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ROBERT
{1:36:7 - 1:36:20} {DIALOGUE}: No.

{1:36:43 - 1:36:45} {DIALOGUE}: What does that mean -- to be noble?

{1:45:53 - 1:46:40} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William is not the only one who notices the resemblance; he glances at Hamish and Campbell and sees them haunted by it too.
{1:45:53 - 1:46:40} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Is this another dream?
{1:45:53 - 1:46:40} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pales, as she steps into the morning sun.
{1:45:53 - 1:46:40} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She moves toward him, her face lowered.
{1:45:53 - 1:46:40} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is Marion!
{1:45:53 - 1:46:40} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She reaches him, lifts her face... and he sees the Princess!
{1:45:53 - 1:46:40} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William is relieved -- and yet as he sees the Princess more closely he is still shaken by the resemblance in the way she carries herself, her shape, the fall of her hair.
{1:45:53 - 1:46:40} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Princess is struck with Wallace, too -- tall, powerful, and commanding.
{1:45:53 - 1:46:40} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wallace dismounts, and moves to face her.

{1:46:52 - 1:47:17} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Watching the gorgeous walk, Stephen lies back on his saddle and twitches his leg like a horny dog.
{1:46:52 - 1:47:17} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hamish backhands him; Campbell, Hamish and Stephen quickly dismount and follow the procession, shouldering their way in beside the Princess's French guards, so they can watch Wallace's back.

{1:46:52 - 1:47:17} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She sits; he refuses the chair.

{1:53:44 - 1:56:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LONGSHANKS

{1:53:44 - 1:56:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The bolt slashes through the air and punches through the armor and the melon, leaving no doubt what it would do to a man's heart.
{1:53:44 - 1:56:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The nobles pale.
{1:53:44 - 1:56:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAIG

{1:53:44 - 1:56:22} {META_DATA}: (beat)

{1:53:44 - 1:56:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAIG
{1:56:20 - 1:56:22} {DIALOGUE}: We cannot defeat this --
{1:56:20 - 1:56:26} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WALLACE
{1:56:20 - 1:56:26} {DIALOGUE}: With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
{1:56:20 - 1:56:26} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAIG
{1:56:20 - 1:56:26} {DIALOGUE}: It is suicide.
{1:56:20 - 1:56:26} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ROBERT

{1:56:22 - 1:56:32} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Bruce sees Wallace about to explode, and tries to intervene -- but Wallace's anger is too great.
{1:56:22 - 1:56:32} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WALLACE
{1:56:27 - 1:56:32} {DIALOGUE}: We won at Stirling and still you quibbled!
{1:56:32 - 1:56:35} {DIALOGUE}: We won at York and you would not support us!
{1:56:32 - 1:56:53} {DIALOGUE}: Then I said nothing!
{1:56:32 - 1:56:53} {DIALOGUE}: Now I say you are cowards!
{1:56:32 - 1:56:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The nobles grip their weapons; Wallace, Hamish and Stephen are ready to finish this quarrel right here.

{1:56:32 - 1:56:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ROBERT

{1:56:49 - 1:56:53} {DIALOGUE}: Speak with me alone!

{1:56:54 - 1:57:1} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The nobles stalk away, and Robert draws Wallace away, to the target Wallace shot, so they are alone.
{1:56:54 - 1:57:1} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ROBERT
{1:56:59 - 1:57:1} {DIALOGUE}: You have achieved more than anyone dreamed.
{1:57:2 - 1:57:5} {DIALOGUE}: But fighting these odds looks like rage, not courage.
{1:57:2 - 1:57:24} {DIALOGUE}: Peace offers its rewards!
{1:57:2 - 1:57:24} {DIALOGUE}: Has war become a habit you cannot break?
{1:57:2 - 1:57:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The question strikes deep.
{1:57:2 - 1:57:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WALLACE
{1:57:2 - 1:57:24} {DIALOGUE}: War finds me willing.
{1:57:2 - 1:57:24} {DIALOGUE}: I know it won't bring back all I have lost.
{1:57:21 - 1:57:24} {DIALOGUE}: But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own.
{1:57:21 - 1:57:35} {DIALOGUE}: For that we need a king.
{1:57:21 - 1:57:35} {DIALOGUE}: We need you.
{1:57:21 - 1:57:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ROBERT
{1:57:21 - 1:57:35} {DIALOGUE}: I am trying.
{1:57:21 - 1:57:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WALLACE
{1:57:21 - 1:57:35} {DIALOGUE}: Then tell me what a king is!
{1:57:21 - 1:57:35} {DIALOGUE}: Is he a man who believes only what others believe?
{1:57:21 - 1:57:35} {DIALOGUE}: Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart?
{1:57:31 - 1:57:35} {DIALOGUE}: There is strength in you.
{1:57:31 - 1:57:35} {DIALOGUE}: I see it.
{1:57:31 - 1:58:3} {DIALOGUE}: I know it.
{1:57:31 - 1:58:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ROBERT
{1:57:31 - 1:58:3} {DIALOGUE}: I must... consult with my father.
{1:57:31 - 1:58:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WALLACE
{1:57:31 - 1:58:3} {DIALOGUE}: And I will consult with mine.

{1:57:31 - 1:58:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wallace rejoins Hamish and Stephen.
{1:57:31 - 1:58:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They look to him; what do we do now?
{1:57:31 - 1:58:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WALLACE
{1:57:31 - 1:58:3} {DIALOGUE}: Remember when the English turned their hounds on us?
{1:57:31 - 1:58:3} {DIALOGUE}: Maybe we should introduce them to our dogs.

{1:58:1 - 1:58:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: THE LEPER
{1:58:10 - 1:58:15} {DIALOGUE}: You have said yourself that the nobles will not support Wallace, so how does it help us to join the side that is slaughtered?
{1:58:10 - 1:58:33} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Heartsick, the father reaches across the table, then stays his arm, unwilling to touch his son with his leprous hand.
{1:58:10 - 1:58:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: THE LEPER
{1:58:31 - 1:58:33} {DIALOGUE}: My son.
{1:58:35 - 1:58:38} {DIALOGUE}: Look at me.
{1:58:44 - 1:58:46} {DIALOGUE}: I cannot be king.
{1:58:46 - 1:58:49} {DIALOGUE}: You, and you alone, can rule Scotland.
{1:58:49 - 1:58:52} {DIALOGUE}: What I tell you, you must do -- for yourself, and for your country.
{1:58:49 - 1:59:33} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Young Robert holds his father with his eyes, and does not look away.
{1:58:49 - 1:59:33} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. THE BATTLE OF FALKIRK - DAY

{1:58:49 - 1:59:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMISH

{1:59:31 - 1:59:44} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WALLACE
{1:59:31 - 1:59:44} {DIALOGUE}: Mornay has come.
{1:59:40 - 1:59:44} {DIALOGUE}: So will the Bruce.
{1:59:40 - 2:1:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He'd better, the odds look long.
{1:59:40 - 2:1:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And it's nasty ground; one side of the field is ankle deep in water, and the English are covering it with a layer of burning oil, releasing thick smoke to hide their movements.
{1:59:40 - 2:1:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WALLACE
{1:59:40 - 2:1:52} {DIALOGUE}: Stephen ready?
{1:59:40 - 2:1:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMISH

{1:59:40 - 2:1:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WALLACE AND THE SCOTS
{1:59:40 - 2:1:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: see them through the smoke; Wallace spots what he's looking for: there they are, the ranks of crossbowmen!

{1:59:40 - 2:1:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He sees the bowmen more clearly, and the English infantry.
{1:59:40 - 2:1:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Some are wearing kilts and marching to bagpipes.

{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Stephen sees him, and is ashamed.
{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHEN
{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {DIALOGUE}: So that's where Longshanks got his soldiers.
{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {DIALOGUE}: Irishmen, willing to kill Scottish cousins for the English.
{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {DIALOGUE}: Their families are starving, they'll feed them however they can.
{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {DIALOGUE}: If you don't want to fight them --
{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHEN
{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {DIALOGUE}: No.
{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {DIALOGUE}: I'll stand with you.

{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The formations, bristling with spears, move forward.
{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hamish looks back at Wallace; both men know the spearmen are the bait here.
{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wallace and Stephen see the English heavy cavalry advancing.
{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHEN
{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {DIALOGUE}: They can't be that stupid to attack the schiltrons again.
{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wallace is scanning the battlefield.
{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He sees the English cavalry charge, but before they reach the bristling spears, they pull up, and crossbowmen, moving up behind the knights.
{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WALLACE
{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {DIALOGUE}: It's only a faint to shield the crossbows!
{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crossbowmen fire a volley, too hurriedly.
{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see the hailstorm of bolts slash through the air in unison -- you can actually see them coming.
{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The bows fall short of the front ranks of the schiltrons.
{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WALLACE
{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {DIALOGUE}: Now!
{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {DIALOGUE}: Give 'em the dogs!

{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crossbowmen are distracted from their reloading by the appearance of the mastiffs; now, as the Scottish handlers run toward the English ranks and unleash the dogs, fear races through the English line.
{2:1:50 - 2:4:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The dogs tear into them.

{2:4:12 - 2:10:46} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The English bowmen are about to fire again, but they see the Scottish charge bearing down on them and adjust their aim; the bolts cut into the infantrymen; one bolt tears off the armor of Wallace's left shoulder.

{2:4:12 - 2:10:46} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The shock and recognition stun Wallace; in that moment, looking at Robert the Bruce's guilt-ridden face, he understands everything: the betrayal, the hopelessness of Scotland.
{2:4:12 - 2:10:46} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he stands there frozen, a bolt punches into the muscle of his neck, and Wallace doesn't react to it.

{2:4:12 - 2:10:46} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His own troops reach him, realize who he is, see the horrible expression on his face, and race on after the Scots.
{2:4:12 - 2:10:46} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Robert is left alone, on his knees in the water, the fire and noise of battle now dim to him, as if his senses have died along with his heart.

{2:18:28 - 2:19:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PRINCESS
{2:18:28 - 2:19:50} {DIALOGUE}: And you have reached Wallace's men?
{2:18:28 - 2:19:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CHIEF ASSASSIN
{2:18:28 - 2:19:50} {DIALOGUE}: We tell the villagers, and the traitors pass it on.

{2:18:28 - 2:19:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hamish is unsure if he did the right thing in coming here -- unsure, until Wallace moves to them, and hugs them.

{2:18:28 - 2:19:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are in the old secret cave; rain is falling, but it's dry inside, with a campfire smoldering at the entrance.
{2:18:28 - 2:19:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WALLACE
{2:18:28 - 2:19:50} {DIALOGUE}: Thanks for the food and drink.

{2:18:28 - 2:19:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMISH
{2:18:28 - 2:19:50} {DIALOGUE}: We're here to stay.

{2:18:28 - 2:19:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He swigs, hands it to Hamish for a chug, then to Wallace, who declines, but smiles for the first time in many weeks.

{2:18:28 - 2:19:50} {DIALOGUE}: He has dispatched his daughter-in-law as his emissary, and she has sent word that she wishes to meet you -- in a barn.

{2:18:28 - 2:19:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hauntingly similar to the one in Wallace's childhood.
{2:18:28 - 2:19:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he sits on his horse and looks at the place, surmounted by a white flag of truce, it gives him a chill.
{2:18:28 - 2:19:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But in full view of the barn, he hands Hamish his sword and rides forward.
{2:18:28 - 2:19:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INSIDE THE BARN

{2:18:28 - 2:19:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CHIEF ASSASSIN
{2:19:47 - 2:19:50} {DIALOGUE}: It's William Wallace, sure!
{2:19:50 - 2:19:52} {DIALOGUE}: And... he's given up his sword!
{2:19:53 - 2:19:56} {DIALOGUE}: Be ready!
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They position themselves at every entrance.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: OUTSIDE THE BARN
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wallace reaches the barn, dismounts, and moves toward the door.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But suddenly, instead of entering, he grabs the heavy bar and seals the door!
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At this motion, Scots spring from the woods in all directions.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The assassins inside realize the ambush is being turned on them, but it's too late; they hear the entrance being sealed from the outside.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: More Scots, led by Stephen, scramble up from hiding, place tinder-dry brush and pitch against the barn, and set it on fire.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In moments the entire barn is blazing.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Scots stand back and watch the barn burn, their faces lit by the flames.

{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She stands on the wall, looking out at it.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then she sees, on a hillside, silhouetted against the night and the fire, a rider, just sitting there on his horse, looking at the castle.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She runs into the castle, up the stairs, and stands on the pinnacle of the castle, so that she too is silhouetted, and he can see her.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The lone rider is William Wallace.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLOSE - A CANDLE
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: being placed in a window of the stable cottage, built into the outer wall of the castle.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: AT A DISTANCE, the candle burns like a tiny beacon.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And William sees it.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INSIDE THE STABLE COTTAGE, THE PRINCESS
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: sits alone, wondering if her signal is going to work.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: OUTSIDE THE CASTLE
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wallace climbs the castle wall, hand over hand up the mortared stones, to the window twenty feet above the ground.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He reaches the safety of the window cove and kneels on the ledge.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks through the window, and sees her inside.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INSIDE THE ROOM, she looks up, and sees him there.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The first glance frightens her, and yet she expected him, prayed for him to come.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now, for a long, long moment the two of them look at each other through the glass, each realizing the implications of this moment.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She moves to the window and opens it.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The wind rushing through extinguishes the candle, and he slips inside.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They face each other in the darkness.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then she strikes a match and relights the candle, and they look at each other.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WALLACE
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {DIALOGUE}: A meeting in a barn.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {DIALOGUE}: It had to be a trap.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {DIALOGUE}: And only you would know I would be aware of it.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PRINCESS
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {DIALOGUE}: It does me good to see you.
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {DIALOGUE}: I am much diminished since we met.

{2:19:53 - 2:22:6} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PRINCESS
{2:22:2 - 2:22:6} {DIALOGUE}: There will be a new shipment of supplies coming north next month.

{2:22:6 - 2:22:12} {DIALOGUE}: No.
{2:22:8 - 2:22:12} {DIALOGUE}: Stop.
{2:22:8 - 2:22:27} {DIALOGUE}: I didn't come here for that.
{2:22:8 - 2:22:27} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PRINCESS
{2:22:8 - 2:22:27} {DIALOGUE}: Then why did you come?
{2:22:8 - 2:22:27} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WALLACE
{2:22:8 - 2:22:27} {DIALOGUE}: Why did you?
{2:22:8 - 2:22:27} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PRINCESS
{2:22:23 - 2:22:27} {DIALOGUE}: Because of the way you're looking at me now.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: The same way... as when we met.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns his face away.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gently, she pulls it back.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PRINCESS
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: I know.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: You looked at me... and saw her.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He twists back toward the window.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PRINCESS
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: You must forgive me what I feel.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: No man has ever looked at me as you did.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Surprised, he looks at her now.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WALLACE
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: You have... you have a husband.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PRINCESS
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: I have taken vows.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: More than one.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: And I cannot keep both promises.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Slowly, it starts to dawn on him what she's asking, and an unexpected smile plays at his lips.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her smile lights too.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PRINCESS
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: You understand.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: Consider, before you laugh and say no.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: You will never own a throne, though you deserve one.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WALLACE
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PRINCESS
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: No.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost?
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: Or simply love me... because I love you?
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Slowly, he reaches to the candle flame, and pinches it out.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: IN THE SHADOWS OF THE COTTAGE BED
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: we see the surging, pent-up passion... and
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {META_DATA}: DISSOLVE TO:
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE LOVERS
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Their bodies limp, they lie asleep, entwined.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The first rays of morning spread yellow light through the room and across their faces.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wallace wakes suddenly; sunlight!
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He grabs for his clothes, as she wakes, covers herself in the blanket and jumps out of bed, rushing to the window to look out.

{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: No one!
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: Hurry!
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He reaches her, throws the window open, and sees a clear path down the wall to safety.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stops and looks at her, and touches her face in gratitude.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She has to ask...
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PRINCESS
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: When we... did you think of her?
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Pausing to look straight into her eyes, he kisses her -- her, not Marion -- and climbs out.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She watches him go.

{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -- Wallace and fifty men gallop through a village on the way to an English fortress; the villagers drop what they're doing and run to follow them; we see Wallace's face, relentless, as he hacks men down in the attack; with the fortress sacked and smoking in the background, we see Wallace lead his men away, the people cheering him...

{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMISH

{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHEN

{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WALLACE
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: Aye.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: But it won't let me dream.

{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He sits by a palace hearth, where a huge blaze burns; still he's huddled beneath a blanket, and coughing blood.

{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The coffin is closed; on its top is a lifesize stone carving of his father as a knight in final repose.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ranks of candles light the scene, and Robert's face, cold as the stone.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A SHUFFLE... Robert looks up to see old Craig.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAIG

{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ROBERT
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: He was a modest man.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAIG

{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAIG

{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Robert only stares at his father's stone coffin.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAIG
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: Longshanks knows his son will scarcely be able to rule England, much less half of France.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: He needs Scotland settled, and he trusts you, after Falkirk.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: If you pay him homage, he will recognize you as king of Scotland.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: Our nobles have agreed to this as well.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He shows Robert a parchment bearing the noblest names in Scotland.
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Bruce barely glances at it.

{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAIG
{2:22:23 - 2:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: Homage is nothing.
