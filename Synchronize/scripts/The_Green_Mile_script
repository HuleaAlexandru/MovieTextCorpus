{0:1:45 - 0:3:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BRAD

{0:1:45 - 0:3:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BRAD
{0:1:45 - 0:3:37} {DIALOGUE}: It's not about harm, it's about rules.
{0:1:45 - 0:3:37} {DIALOGUE}: You probably don't think an old fart like you has to mind rules anymore, but that's just not true.
{0:1:45 - 0:3:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brad's eyes keep shifting--he obviously doesn't mind abusing the elderly as long as he doesn't get caught doing it.
{0:1:45 - 0:3:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL

{0:3:35 - 0:5:2} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BRAD
{0:3:35 - 0:5:2} {DIALOGUE}: What do you do up there, anyway?

{0:3:35 - 0:5:2} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL

{0:4:59 - 0:5:6} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ELAINE
{0:4:59 - 0:5:6} {DIALOGUE}: I saw you coming back, thought you'd like some tea.
{0:4:59 - 0:5:6} {META_DATA}: (beat)

{0:4:59 - 0:5:6} {DIALOGUE}: About the weather.
{0:4:59 - 0:5:6} {DIALOGUE}: I think we're through now.
{0:4:59 - 0:5:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brad lets Paul loose, leans close:

{0:4:59 - 0:5:6} {DIALOGUE}: Paulie?
{0:4:59 - 0:5:6} {DIALOGUE}: You tell anyone I squeezed your po' ol' hand, I'll tell 'em you're having senile delusions.
{0:4:59 - 0:5:6} {DIALOGUE}: Who you think they'll believe?
{0:4:59 - 0:5:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brad walks off.
{0:4:59 - 0:5:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul turns, watches him go.
{0:4:59 - 0:5:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The screen door opens and Elaine steps out, her face pale.
{0:4:59 - 0:5:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul gives her a strained, though grateful, smile as we

{0:5:9 - 0:6:27} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and WE CONTINUE PANNING to Paul and Elaine sitting near the back, talking quietly as Paul rubs his bruised hand:
{0:5:9 - 0:6:27} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ELAINE

{0:5:9 - 0:6:27} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{0:5:9 - 0:6:27} {DIALOGUE}: That might just provoke him all the more, make things worse for everybody.
{0:5:9 - 0:6:27} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ELAINE
{0:5:9 - 0:6:27} {DIALOGUE}: It's not everybody he has it in for, Paul.
{0:5:9 - 0:6:27} {DIALOGUE}: It's you.
{0:5:9 - 0:6:27} {META_DATA}: (off his look)
{0:5:9 - 0:6:27} {DIALOGUE}: What did you do to provoke him in the first place?
{0:5:9 - 0:6:27} {DIALOGUE}: Nothing.

{0:5:9 - 0:6:27} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul
{0:5:9 - 0:6:27} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: idly shifts his gaze to the TV...and his expression goes slack with recognition and dismay.
{0:5:9 - 0:6:27} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Elaine sees the look in his eyes.

{0:5:9 - 0:6:27} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The past just caught up with him with a freight-train wallop, and, for one, he decides to ride the rails...

{0:6:22 - 0:7:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SLOW PUSH IN on Paul, watching.
{0:6:22 - 0:7:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He'd like to take his eyes off the screen, but the movie has him in a grip tighter than Brad Dolan's.

{0:6:22 - 0:7:4} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ELAINE
{0:7:3 - 0:7:4} {DIALOGUE}: Paul?
{0:7:3 - 0:7:8} {DIALOGUE}: What is it?
{0:7:3 - 0:7:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: No response.
{0:7:3 - 0:7:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All he can hear is that music, all he can see are those dancers.
{0:7:3 - 0:7:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The figures on TV are gliding with ghostlike grace in their silvery, phosphor-dot world of long ago...
{0:7:3 - 0:7:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul abruptly bursts into tears.
{0:7:3 - 0:7:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The room goes quiet, everything comes to a standstill.

{0:7:3 - 0:7:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul just sits sobbing into his hands, shoulders heaving.

{0:7:56 - 0:8:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{0:8:3 - 0:8:7} {DIALOGUE}: I ever tell you I was a prison guard during the depression?
{0:8:3 - 0:8:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ELAINE

{0:8:7 - 0:8:12} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{0:8:10 - 0:8:12} {DIALOGUE}: Did I mention I was in charge of death row?
{0:8:12 - 0:8:15} {DIALOGUE}: That I supervised all the executions?
{0:8:12 - 0:8:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This does come as a surprise.
{0:8:12 - 0:8:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She shakes her head.
{0:8:12 - 0:8:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{0:8:19 - 0:8:24} {DIALOGUE}: They usually call death row the Last Mile, but we called ours the Green Mile, because the floor was the color of faded limes.
{0:8:31 - 0:8:34} {DIALOGUE}: We had the electric chair then.
{0:8:34 - 0:8:36} {DIALOGUE}: Old Sparky, we called it.

{0:9:3 - 0:11:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A late 20's Ford PRISON TRUCK comes chugging into view along the road, kicking up a long trail of dust in the heat.

{0:9:3 - 0:11:4} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN PENITENTIARY - ESTABLISHING - DAY

{0:9:3 - 0:11:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: BRUTUS HOWELL(nicknamed "Brutal" for his intimidating size, but he's actually rather thoughtful by nature) stands at the entry door of the cellblock, peering out through a viewing slot.
{0:9:3 - 0:11:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He sees the prison truck arrive at the main gate.
{0:9:3 - 0:11:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns and nods to fellow guard DEAN STANTON sitting at the duty desk, then cross the Green Mile--a wide corridor of faded green linoleum running some sixty paces top to bottom, with four large cells to a side.

{0:9:3 - 0:11:4} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL

{0:11:11 - 0:11:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL (O.S.)

{0:11:11 - 0:11:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL

{0:11:36 - 0:11:39} {DIALOGUE}: With a new arrival?
{0:11:36 - 0:11:39} {DIALOGUE}: You know better.

{0:11:42 - 0:12:2} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DEL
{0:11:42 - 0:12:2} {DIALOGUE}: New boy coming in, boss?
{0:11:42 - 0:12:2} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{0:11:42 - 0:12:2} {DIALOGUE}: Never you mind, Del, you just keep your nose quietly on your business.
{0:11:42 - 0:12:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul arrives at the end of the Mile, takes up a position at an empty cell.
{0:11:42 - 0:12:2} {META_DATA}: (Down at this end, past the cells, is E Block's version of the "hole" -- a padded room where violent inmates are sent to cool off.
{0:11:42 - 0:12:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It isn't used very often...in fact, at the moment, it's doubling as storage space.)
{0:11:42 - 0:12:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brutal
{0:11:42 - 0:12:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: peers out the viewing slot as the truck stops outside.
{0:11:42 - 0:12:2} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL
{0:12:0 - 0:12:2} {DIALOGUE}: Damn, they're riding on the axle.
{0:12:14 - 0:12:15} {DIALOGUE}: What'd they do, bust the springs?
{0:12:14 - 0:12:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: GUARDS PERCY WETMORE AND HARRY TERWILLIGER OF E BLOCK emerge from the back of the truck and step down, turn back...

{0:12:14 - 0:12:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We get our first glimpse of the new inmate as a pair of GIGANTIC BLACK FEET step down into the yard...and the rear of the truck bounces back up on its springs where it belongs.
{0:12:14 - 0:12:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brutal
{0:12:14 - 0:12:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: sees what's coming, eyes widening slightly.
{0:12:14 - 0:12:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL
{0:12:14 - 0:12:43} {DIALOGUE}: Paul?
{0:12:40 - 0:12:43} {DIALOGUE}: You might wanna reconsider getting in the cell with this guy?
{0:12:40 - 0:12:45} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{0:12:40 - 0:12:45} {DIALOGUE}: Why's that?

{0:12:45 - 0:13:1} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He swings the door open in a hot flood of daylight, giving us our first good look at:
{0:12:45 - 0:13:1} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John coffey
{0:12:45 - 0:13:1} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: is a huge black man, nearly 7 feet tall and 300 pounds, his massive head shiny and bald, his skin a tapestry of old scars, his prison overalls (the biggest size they had) ending at mid-calf.
{0:12:45 - 0:13:1} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks dull and confused, as if wondering where he is and how he got there.
{0:12:45 - 0:13:1} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy and Harry lead him toward E Block in shackles.
{0:12:45 - 0:13:1} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy's got his hickory baton out of it custom-made holster, hollering:
{0:12:45 - 0:13:1} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PERCY
{0:13:0 - 0:13:1} {DIALOGUE}: Dead man walking!
{0:13:5 - 0:13:8} {DIALOGUE}: Dead man walking here!

{0:13:5 - 0:13:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy is the first one through the door, still hollering...
{0:13:5 - 0:13:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PERCY
{0:13:5 - 0:13:23} {DIALOGUE}: Dead man walking!
{0:13:5 - 0:13:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...then Coffey enters, ducking low to get through, his shadow blotting out Brutal and Dean as his massive frame fills the door.
{0:13:5 - 0:13:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everything hangs suspended for a moment, a look of "hold shit" written on everybody's faces.
{0:13:5 - 0:13:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy keeps yanking on the big man's cuffs, leading him along with a cry of:
{0:13:5 - 0:13:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PERCY
{0:13:5 - 0:13:23} {DIALOGUE}: Dead man walking!
{0:13:5 - 0:13:23} {DIALOGUE}: Dead man--
{0:13:5 - 0:13:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL

{0:13:5 - 0:13:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL

{0:13:5 - 0:13:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey shakes his head slowly.
{0:13:5 - 0:13:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul takes the clipboard transfer papers from Harry, turns and enters the cell.
{0:13:5 - 0:13:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey just stands outside the cell and waits, as if he doesn't understand the concept.
{0:13:5 - 0:13:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul motions him to come on in.
{0:13:5 - 0:13:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey starts to comply, but Percy raps him smartly with the tip of his hickory baton to get him moving faster.
{0:13:5 - 0:13:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey flinches, enters the cell.
{0:13:5 - 0:13:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul stares angrily at Percy, who stands slapping his hickory baton against the palm of his hand like a man with a toy he's itching to use.
{0:13:5 - 0:13:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{0:13:21 - 0:13:23} {DIALOGUE}: Percy.
{0:14:29 - 0:14:31} {DIALOGUE}: They're moving house over in the infirmary.
{0:14:31 - 0:14:34} {DIALOGUE}: Why don't you go see if they could use some help?
{0:14:31 - 0:14:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PERCY

{0:14:35 - 0:14:39} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL

{0:14:37 - 0:14:46} {META_DATA}: (off his look)
{0:14:42 - 0:14:46} {DIALOGUE}: I don't care where you go, Percy, as long as it's not here at this very moment.
{0:14:42 - 0:15:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy flushes red, the baton hovering near his palm.
{0:14:42 - 0:15:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks like he's about to say something, but thinks better of it and stalks angrily up the Mile instead...
{0:14:42 - 0:15:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and sees Del at his bars, smiling.
{0:14:42 - 0:15:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Infuriated, Percy swings his baton and smashes Del's fingers with a LOUD CRACK.

{0:15:9 - 0:15:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He swaggers out.

{0:16:16 - 0:16:26} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{0:16:16 - 0:16:26} {DIALOGUE}: Your time here can be easy or hard, depends on you.
{0:16:16 - 0:16:26} {DIALOGUE}: If you behave, you get to walk in the exercise yard every day.
{0:16:16 - 0:16:26} {DIALOGUE}: We might even play some music on the radio from time to time.

{0:16:27 - 0:16:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul blinks.
{0:16:27 - 0:16:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's the last thing he expected.
{0:16:27 - 0:16:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey smiles uneasily, as if they might think him foolish for asking.
{0:16:27 - 0:16:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY
{0:16:32 - 0:16:35} {DIALOGUE}: Because I get a little scared in the dark sometimes.

{0:16:55 - 0:17:51} {CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY

{0:26:24 - 0:26:40} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{0:26:37 - 0:26:40} {DIALOGUE}: No, because he'll want me to take sulfa tablets and I'll spend the rest of the week puking in every corner of my office.

{0:26:47 - 0:27:21} {DIALOGUE}: Paul?
{0:26:47 - 0:27:21} {DIALOGUE}: Dean?

{0:26:47 - 0:27:21} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL

{0:27:31 - 0:27:46} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It trots a short distance, peers right and left as if checking the snoring inmates in their cells, then makes another forward spurt.

{0:27:31 - 0:27:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DEAN
{0:27:43 - 0:27:46} {DIALOGUE}: It ain't normal for a mouse to come up on people that way.

{0:27:58 - 0:28:13} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The mouse stops before them and peers up, curling its tail primly around its paws as if to wait.
{0:27:58 - 0:28:13} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The guards fall silent, fascinated.
{0:27:58 - 0:28:13} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bitterbuck stirs in his cell, sits up to watch.
{0:27:58 - 0:28:13} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brutal tears off a piece of his half-eaten corned beef sandwich, holds it delicately out with two fingers.
{0:27:58 - 0:28:13} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The mouse rises up, appraising the morsel with shiny black eyes.
{0:27:58 - 0:28:13} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DEAN
{0:27:58 - 0:28:13} {DIALOGUE}: Aw, Brutal, no!

{0:28:9 - 0:28:13} {META_DATA}: (to Paul)
{0:28:9 - 0:28:13} {DIALOGUE}: I just wanna see what he'll do.

{0:28:14 - 0:28:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dean throws Paul an "I told you so" look.

{0:28:56 - 0:28:58} {DIALOGUE}: He's in the damn restraint room.
{0:29:1 - 0:29:3} {DIALOGUE}: You know he's gonna be chewing the padding out of walls and making himself a nice little nest.
{0:29:1 - 0:29:10} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brutal give Paul a sheepish look--well?
{0:29:1 - 0:29:10} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul sighs.
{0:29:1 - 0:29:10} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{0:29:9 - 0:29:10} {DIALOGUE}: All right.

{0:29:26 - 0:29:31} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{0:29:29 - 0:29:31} {DIALOGUE}: Can't put anything over on you.
{0:29:29 - 0:30:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul unlocks the door, revealing a padded room filled with storage: cleaning supplies, buckets of paint, mops and ladders, you name it.
{0:29:29 - 0:30:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brutal shrugs off his jacket.

{0:29:29 - 0:30:6} {META_DATA}: DISSOLVE:

{0:29:29 - 0:30:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Their eyes go glaringly to Dean.

{0:30:22 - 0:30:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{0:30:22 - 0:30:33} {DIALOGUE}: Yeah, that's right.

{0:30:30 - 0:31:27} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He starts walking the Mile as before...
{0:30:30 - 0:31:27} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...right toward Percy.
{0:30:30 - 0:31:27} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: COFFEY

{0:31:39 - 0:31:49} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BILL
{0:31:39 - 0:31:49} {DIALOGUE}: My ass.

{0:32:3 - 0:33:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The mouse picks it up, starts to eat.

{0:32:3 - 0:33:2} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BILL
{0:32:3 - 0:33:2} {DIALOGUE}: Here, lemme try.
{0:32:3 - 0:33:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bill drops a piece of cracker.
{0:32:3 - 0:33:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The mouse ignores it completely, keeping its beady little eyes on Harry.

{0:32:3 - 0:33:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: and launches his baton like a spear, scaring the crap out of everyone.
{0:32:3 - 0:33:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The mouse ducks (yes, actually ducks) and the baton sail over his head close enough to ruffle its fur, bouncing off the floor.
{0:32:3 - 0:33:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Apparently remembering a pressing engagement elsewhere, the mouse takes off in a flash toward the restraint room.
{0:32:3 - 0:33:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy roars with frustration and takes off after it, trying to squash it with his heavy work shoes, leaping and stomping with great big galloping strides, missing the mouse by inches...
{0:32:3 - 0:33:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and thus is the Green Mile traversed, with Percy stomping and hollering like a spastic flamenco dancer, the convicts yelling at their bars, the mouse zigging and zagging like Jim Thorpe heading for the endzone...

{0:33:3 - 0:33:31} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: --and rush in to find:
{0:33:3 - 0:33:31} {CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRY

{1:2:11 - 1:2:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul blinks.
{1:2:11 - 1:2:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Maybe it's the fever clouding his brain, or maybe...hell, is this what being hypnotized is like?

{1:2:31 - 1:2:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He arches back with his mouth agape and arms outstretched as a rush of energy seems to pass from Paul through Coffey's hand...

{1:3:15 - 1:4:10} {DIALOGUE}: John?
{1:3:15 - 1:4:10} {DIALOGUE}: John, what's wrong?
{1:3:15 - 1:4:10} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul fumbles his keys to the lock, unsure if he should open the door, watching the big man's contortions grow stronger like a cat trying to cough up a hairball...
{1:3:15 - 1:4:10} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and then comes an unpleasant, gagging/retching sound as Coffey's lips draw back from his teeth in a kind of godawful sneer...and he exhales a cloud of what look like tiny black insects.
{1:3:15 - 1:4:10} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They swirl furiously in front of his face, turn white...and disappear.
{1:3:15 - 1:4:10} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul just stares, stunned.

{1:12:56 - 1:12:59} {DIALOGUE}: That dog attacked my boy for no reason.
{1:12:59 - 1:13:1} {DIALOGUE}: Just got it into his mind one day.
{1:13:2 - 1:13:4} {DIALOGUE}: Same with John Coffey.
{1:13:2 - 1:13:20} {DIALOGUE}: He was sorry afterwards, of that I have no doubt...but those little girls stayed raped and murdered nonetheless.
{1:13:18 - 1:13:20} {DIALOGUE}: Maybe he's never done it before--my dog never bit before, but I didn't concern myself with that.
{1:13:25 - 1:13:29} {DIALOGUE}: I went out there with my rifle and grabbed his collar and blew his brains out.

{1:13:25 - 1:13:32} {DIALOGUE}: I would not bring back slavery for all the tea in China.
{1:13:25 - 1:13:32} {DIALOGUE}: I believe we have to be humane and generous in our efforts to solve the race problem.
{1:13:25 - 1:13:32} {DIALOGUE}: But we have to remember that the negro will bite if he gets the chance, just like a mongrel dog will bite if it crosses its mind to do so.
{1:13:25 - 1:13:32} {META_DATA}: (beat)
{1:13:31 - 1:13:32} {DIALOGUE}: Is Coffey guilty?
{1:13:35 - 1:13:37} {DIALOGUE}: Yes, he is.
{1:13:39 - 1:13:42} {DIALOGUE}: Don't you doubt it, and don't you turn your back on him.

{1:13:43 - 1:14:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BURT

{2:13:27 - 2:14:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The woman propped in bed barely resembles Melinda Moores anymore--she looks made up like a Halloween witch, her livid skin hanging in a loose trail of wrinkles, one corner of her mouth twisted.

{2:13:27 - 2:14:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her hair has gone white and straw-like, her eyes glowering at Coffey with lively, irrational interest:
{2:13:27 - 2:14:42} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MELINDA

{2:13:27 - 2:14:42} {DIALOGUE}: Pull down your pants!

{2:13:27 - 2:14:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey just stands there for a moment, watching her from a distance, then approaches the bed...

{2:14:39 - 2:14:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...but as he draws closer, a change occurs.

{2:15:15 - 2:15:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The world seems to be slowing down, growing very still indeed...
{2:15:15 - 2:15:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and he starts bending slowly toward her.
{2:15:15 - 2:15:25} {CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY
{2:15:24 - 2:15:25} {DIALOGUE}: Ma'am?
{2:15:24 - 2:15:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MELINDA

{2:15:51 - 2:17:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He brushes her forehead with his lips...the gentlest whisper of a kiss...then moves his mouth down to hers.
{2:15:51 - 2:17:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For a moment we can see one of her eyes staring past him, filling with an expression of surprise...
{2:15:51 - 2:17:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and then her face is lost to view as Coffey puts his lips on hers.
{2:15:51 - 2:17:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We hear a soft whistling sound as he begins inhaling the air deeply from her lungs.
{2:15:51 - 2:17:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Something hot and glowing starts passing between them, drawn on his breath...
{2:15:51 - 2:17:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The men watch.
{2:15:51 - 2:17:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The house seems to shudder in that moment, as if the entire world has shifted an inch to the right...
{2:15:51 - 2:17:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: DOWNSTAIRS PARLOR
{2:15:51 - 2:17:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and the grandfather clock stops ticking, the pendulum stopping dead, the glass face cracking neatly up the center...
{2:15:51 - 2:17:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: BEDROOM
{2:15:51 - 2:17:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and a windowpane cracks.
{2:15:51 - 2:17:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then another.
{2:15:51 - 2:17:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A picture falls off the wall.
{2:15:51 - 2:17:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A lightbulb bursts, showering glass.
{2:15:51 - 2:17:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul smells smoke, realizes the fringed coverlet of the bed has caught fire.
{2:15:51 - 2:17:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Moving like a man in a dream, he reaches for the waterglass on the nightstand, douses the flames.
{2:15:51 - 2:17:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey keeps kissing Melinda in that deep and mysterious way, inhaling and inhaling, her hand held in his like a tiny white bird.
{2:15:51 - 2:17:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For a moment we actually hear something screaming, as if some willful imp were being extracted by force...
{2:15:51 - 2:17:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and then it's over.
{2:15:51 - 2:17:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey raises his head, revealing:
{2:15:51 - 2:17:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Melinda's beautiful face.

{2:15:51 - 2:17:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul and his men are expecting Coffey to spit out the "bugs", but he doesn't--he just keeps coughing, deep and hard, barely finding time to snatch in the next breath of air.

{2:15:51 - 2:17:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She looks back at him with amazement, her face like a dirty mirror that's been suddenly wiped clean.

{2:25:42 - 2:27:19} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy pauses near Coffey's cell, careless as always, getting his holster buckled--and a massive black arm grabs him through the bars.

{2:25:42 - 2:27:19} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey's face is pressed so tight between his bars it looks like he's trying to push his head through.

{2:25:42 - 2:27:19} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy's baton drops from his nerveless fingers and clatters to the floor, never to be picked up again.
{2:25:42 - 2:27:19} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then Coffey steps back, rubbing his mouth as if he's tasted something bad.
{2:25:42 - 2:27:19} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The color has returned to his skin.

{2:27:32 - 2:28:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He comes to a swaying stop at Wild Bill's cell...and turns slowly to look in.

{2:28:21 - 2:29:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy just staring...
{2:28:21 - 2:29:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and then he pulls his gun and empties it into Wild Bill as fast as he can pull the trigger.

{2:28:21 - 2:29:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bill takes all six rounds in the chest, reeling back across the cell.
{2:28:21 - 2:29:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He hits the wall and slides down, leaving a smear, his face registering a final look of stunned surprise.
{2:28:21 - 2:29:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul and the other tackle Percy and bring him down, wrestling the gun out of his hand.
{2:28:21 - 2:29:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dean is almost weeping:
