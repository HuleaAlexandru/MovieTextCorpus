{0:44:26 - 0:44:31} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT

{0:44:29 - 0:44:31} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA
{0:44:29 - 0:44:31} {DIALOGUE}: That is an impossibility.
{0:44:31 - 0:44:35} {DIALOGUE}: Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility.
{0:44:31 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT

{0:45:45 - 0:45:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA

{0:45:50 - 0:45:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT
{0:45:52 - 0:45:56} {DIALOGUE}: At the time I was told, it seemed reasonable.
{0:45:52 - 0:45:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA
{0:45:56 - 0:45:59} {DIALOGUE}: Marsellus throwing Tony out of a four story window for giving me a foot massage seemed reasonable?

{0:46:6 - 0:46:14} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA

{0:46:14 - 0:46:20} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT
{0:46:17 - 0:46:20} {DIALOGUE}: But did it happen?
{0:46:17 - 0:46:26} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA
{0:46:20 - 0:46:26} {DIALOGUE}: The only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand, when he shook it.
{0:46:20 - 0:46:32} {DIALOGUE}: I met Anwan once – at my wedding – then never again.
{0:46:28 - 0:46:32} {DIALOGUE}: The truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus tossed Tony Rocky Horror out of that window except Marsellus and Tony Rocky Horror.
{0:46:34 - 0:46:38} {DIALOGUE}: But when you scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle.
