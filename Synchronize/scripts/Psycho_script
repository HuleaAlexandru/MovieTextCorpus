{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Above Midtown section of the city.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is early afternoon, a hot mid-summer day.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The city is sun-sunblanched white and its drifted-up noises are muted in blanched their own echoes.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We fly low, heading in a downtown direction, passing over traffic-clogged streets, parking lots, white business buildings, neatly patterned residential districts.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As we approach downtown section, the character of the city begins to change.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is darker and shabby with age and industry.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see railroad tracks, smokestacks, wholesale fruit-and- vegetable markets, old municipal buildings, empty lots.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: vegetable The very geography seems to give us a climate of nefariousness, of back-doorness, dark and shadowy.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And secret.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We fly lower and faster now, as if seeking out a specific location.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A skinny, high old hotel comes into view.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On its exposed brick side great painted letters advertise "Transients- Low Weekly Rates-Radio in Every Room."
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We pause long enough to establish the shoddy character of this hotel.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Its open, curtainless windows, its silent resigned look so characteristic of such hole-and-corner hotels.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We move forward with purposefulness and-toward a certain window.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The sash is raised as high as it can go, but the shade is pulled down to three or four inches of the inside sill, as if the occupants of the room within wanted privacy but needed air.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We are close now, so that only the lower half of the window frame is in shot.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: No sounds come from within the room.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, we tip downward, go to the narrow space between shade and sill, peep into the room.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A young woman is stretched out on the mussed bed.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She wears a full slip, stockings, no shoes.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She lies in and attitude of physical relaxation, but her face, seen in the dimness of the room, betrays a certain inner-tension, worrisome conflicts.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She is MARY CRANE, an tension, attractive girl nearing the end of her twenties and her rope.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A man stands beside the bed, only the lower half of his figure visible.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We hold on this tableau for a long moment, then start forward.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As we pass under the window shade,
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. THE HOTEL ROOM - (DAY)
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A small room, a slow fan buzzing on a shelf above the narrow bed.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A card of hotel rules is pasted on the mirror above the bureau.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An unopened suitcase and a woman's large, straw open- top handbag are on the bureau.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On the table beside the bed there are a container of Coco- Cola and an unwrapped, untouched egg-salad sandwich.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is no radio.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The man standing by the bed, wearing only trousers, T-shirt and sox, is SAM LOOMIS, a good-looking, sensual shirt man with warm humorous eyes and a compelling smile.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is blotting his neck and face with a thin towel, and is staring down at Mary, a small sweet smile playing about his mouth.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mary keeps her face turned away from him.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After a moment, Sam drops the towel, sits on the bed, leans over and takes Mary into his arms, kisses her long and warmly, holds her with a firm possessiveness.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The kiss is disturbed and finally interrupted by the buzzing closeness of an inconsiderate fly.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sam smiles, pulls away enough to allow Mary to relax again against the pillow.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He studies her, frowns at her unresponsiveness, then speaks in a low, intimate, playful voice.
{0:0:0 - 0:3:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM
{0:3:13 - 0:3:15} {DIALOGUE}: Never did eat your lunch, did you.

{0:3:13 - 0:3:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, and without breaking the kiss, she swings her legs over the side of the bed, toe-searches around, finds her shoes, slips her feet into searches them.
{0:3:13 - 0:3:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And finally pulls away and sits up.
{0:3:13 - 0:3:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:3:15 - 0:3:18} {DIALOGUE}: I better get back to the office.
{0:3:18 - 0:3:20} {DIALOGUE}: These extended lunch hours give my boss excess acid.
{0:3:18 - 0:3:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She rises, goes to the bureau, takes a pair of small earrings out of her bag, begins putting them on, not bothering or perhaps not wanting to look at herself in the mirror.
{0:3:18 - 0:3:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sam watches her, concerned but unable to inhibit his cheery, humorous good mood.
{0:3:18 - 0:3:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Throughout remainder of this scene, they occupy themselves with dressing, hair-combing, etc.
{0:3:18 - 0:3:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM
{0:3:22 - 0:3:24} {DIALOGUE}: Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off.

{0:3:25 - 0:3:32} {META_DATA}: (soft sarcasm)

{0:3:27 - 0:3:34} {META_DATA}: (meaningfully)

{0:3:32 - 0:3:42} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:3:38 - 0:3:42} {DIALOGUE}: Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...
{0:3:38 - 0:3:47} {META_DATA}: (a small anguish)
{0:3:44 - 0:3:47} {DIALOGUE}: Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
{0:3:44 - 0:3:49} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM
{0:3:47 - 0:3:49} {DIALOGUE}: I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels.
{0:3:47 - 0:3:55} {DIALOGUE}: They say it...
{0:3:47 - 0:3:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:3:47 - 0:3:55} {META_DATA}: (interrupting)

{0:3:51 - 0:3:58} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM
{0:3:55 - 0:3:58} {DIALOGUE}: You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
{0:3:55 - 0:4:1} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY

{0:3:55 - 0:4:1} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM
{0:3:55 - 0:4:1} {DIALOGUE}: I'm sorry, Mary.
{0:3:55 - 0:4:1} {META_DATA}: (after a moment)
{0:3:55 - 0:4:1} {DIALOGUE}: My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.'

{0:3:55 - 0:4:1} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:3:55 - 0:4:1} {DIALOGUE}: I've lost my girlish laughter.

{0:3:58 - 0:4:4} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM
{0:4:1 - 0:4:4} {DIALOGUE}: For what?
{0:4:1 - 0:4:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:4:1 - 0:4:8} {DIALOGUE}: This!
{0:4:5 - 0:4:8} {DIALOGUE}: Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive!
{0:4:11 - 0:4:13} {DIALOGUE}: You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
{0:4:11 - 0:4:20} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM
{0:4:11 - 0:4:20} {DIALOGUE}: Okay.
{0:4:17 - 0:4:20} {DIALOGUE}: What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {META_DATA}: (about to argue, then turning away)
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {DIALOGUE}: I haven't time to argue.
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {DIALOGUE}: I'm a working girl.
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {DIALOGUE}: And I'm a working man!
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {DIALOGUE}: We're a regular working-class tragedy!
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {META_DATA}: (he laughs)
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {DIALOGUE}: It is tragic!
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {DIALOGUE}: Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {META_DATA}: (interrupting, seriously)

{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {DIALOGUE}: Can you?
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {DIALOGUE}: Sure.
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {DIALOGUE}: It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He breaks off, his cheeriness dissolved, goes to the window, tries to raise the shade.
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It sticks.
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pulls at it.
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It comes down entirely, and the hot sun glares into the room, revealing it in all its shabbiness and sordidness as if corroborating Mary's words and attitude.
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sam kicks at the fallen shade, laughs in frustration, grabs on to his humor again.
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {DIALOGUE}: And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {META_DATA}: (having to smile)

{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {DIALOGUE}: I wish I were.
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {DIALOGUE}: Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {META_DATA}: (goes close to mary, touches her)
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {DIALOGUE}: Next best thing to no conscience at all.

{0:4:28 - 0:4:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:4:42 - 0:4:46} {DIALOGUE}: We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
{0:4:42 - 0:4:49} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM
{0:4:46 - 0:4:49} {DIALOGUE}: And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?

{0:4:51 - 0:4:53} {DIALOGUE}: Sam!
{0:4:51 - 0:4:57} {DIALOGUE}: No!

{0:4:51 - 0:4:57} {META_DATA}: (after a pause, simply)
{0:4:55 - 0:4:57} {DIALOGUE}: All right.
{0:4:55 - 0:5:10} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She stares at him, surprised at his willingness to continue the affair on her terms, as girls are so often surprised when they discover men will continue to want them even after the sexual bait has been pulled in.
{0:4:55 - 0:5:10} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sam smiles reassuringly, places his hands gently on her arms, speaks with gentle and simple sincerity.
{0:4:55 - 0:5:10} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM
{0:4:55 - 0:5:10} {DIALOGUE}: Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you.

{0:4:55 - 0:5:10} {META_DATA}: (a smile)

{0:5:6 - 0:5:14} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY

{0:5:10 - 0:5:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM
{0:5:10 - 0:5:19} {META_DATA}: (brightly)
{0:5:14 - 0:5:19} {DIALOGUE}: I'm all for it!
{0:5:14 - 0:5:19} {DIALOGUE}: It requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out... otherwise, though, it's only hard work.
{0:5:14 - 0:5:29} {META_DATA}: (a pause)
{0:5:24 - 0:5:29} {DIALOGUE}: But if I can see you, touch you even as simply as this... I won't mind.
{0:5:24 - 0:5:33} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He moves away and again the weight of his pain and problems crushes away his good humor.
{0:5:24 - 0:5:33} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is a quiet moment.
{0:5:24 - 0:5:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM
{0:5:31 - 0:5:33} {DIALOGUE}: I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there.
{0:5:33 - 0:5:36} {DIALOGUE}: I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.

{0:5:46 - 0:5:54} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM
{0:5:50 - 0:5:54} {DIALOGUE}: A couple of years and the debts will be paid off.
{0:5:54 - 0:5:56} {DIALOGUE}: And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
{0:5:54 - 0:6:0} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:5:56 - 0:6:0} {DIALOGUE}: I haven't even been married once yet!
{0:5:56 - 0:6:0} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM

{0:5:56 - 0:6:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:5:56 - 0:6:3} {META_DATA}: (smiling, then with a terrible urgency)

{0:6:12 - 0:6:15} {DIALOGUE}: We'll have a lot of laughs.

{0:6:19 - 0:6:34} {DIALOGUE}: A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.
{0:6:19 - 0:6:34} {DIALOGUE}: And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.
{0:6:19 - 0:6:34} {META_DATA}: (he moves away, suddenly serious)
{0:6:29 - 0:6:34} {DIALOGUE}: Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.

{0:6:43 - 0:6:50} {META_DATA}: (at door)
{0:6:46 - 0:6:50} {DIALOGUE}: I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.

{0:10:45 - 0:14:49} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: No one comes and for a moment Mary considers driving on, as if the emptiness of the station were a warning, an omen that she should listen to.

{0:23:26 - 0:23:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her guilt shines bright in her eyes and she is a person unaccustomed to containing this much guilt in this realistic a situation.
{0:23:26 - 0:23:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, we hear the SOUND of the Used Car Dealer's laugh, hear it as clearly as Mary hears it in her imagination.

{0:23:52 - 0:23:56} {DIALOGUE}: Acted like one.
{0:23:52 - 0:24:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mary blinks, shakes her head, as if trying to shake away these voices of her imagination.
{0:23:52 - 0:24:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She checks the rear-view mirror.
{0:23:52 - 0:24:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR

{0:23:52 - 0:24:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MARY IN NEW CAR
{0:23:52 - 0:24:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She tries to force herself to relax, almost succeeds when she is sprung to tension again by....

{0:23:52 - 0:24:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MARY IN NEW CAR
{0:23:52 - 0:24:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We HEAR the sound of an agitated BUZZ of an intercom system, a sound emanating from Mary's imagination.

{0:23:52 - 0:24:11} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CAROLINE'S VOICE
{0:24:9 - 0:24:11} {DIALOGUE}: Yes, Mr. Lowery.

{0:24:11 - 0:24:17} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CAROLINE'S VOICE
{0:24:13 - 0:24:17} {DIALOGUE}: No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
{0:24:13 - 0:24:21} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LOWERY'S VOICE
{0:24:17 - 0:24:21} {DIALOGUE}: Buzz me the minute she comes in.
{0:24:17 - 0:24:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Again Mary shakes her head, forces herself to stop hearing these "invented" scenes of her imagination.
{0:24:17 - 0:24:24} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. HIGHWAY
{0:24:17 - 0:24:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now we cut to the view of the road, from Mary's viewpoint.

{0:24:21 - 0:24:28} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CAROLINE'S VOICE
{0:24:24 - 0:24:28} {DIALOGUE}: I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know?
{0:24:29 - 0:24:31} {DIALOGUE}: And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
{0:24:29 - 0:24:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LOWERY'S VOICE
{0:24:31 - 0:24:35} {DIALOGUE}: You better run out to the house.
{0:24:31 - 0:24:35} {DIALOGUE}: She may be... unable to answer the phone...
{0:24:31 - 0:24:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CAROLINE'S VOICE
{0:24:35 - 0:24:38} {DIALOGUE}: Her sister's going to do that.
{0:24:35 - 0:24:38} {DIALOGUE}: She's as worried as we are.
{0:24:35 - 0:24:45} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A flush of painful guilt and regret rises up in Mary's face.

{0:24:35 - 0:24:45} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cutting back to Mary, we can sense by the tense muscles of her face that she is driving faster.
{0:24:35 - 0:24:45} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The oncoming headlights blurt at her.
{0:24:35 - 0:24:45} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly we HEAR Lowery's voice, loud now and frightened, as if the anxiety in the man's voice was strong enough to break through Mary's effort to keep her mind silent and her imagination blank.
{0:24:35 - 0:24:45} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LOWERY'S VOICE
{0:24:35 - 0:24:45} {DIALOGUE}: No!
{0:24:42 - 0:24:45} {DIALOGUE}: I haven't the faintest idea.
{0:24:45 - 0:24:48} {DIALOGUE}: As I said, I last saw your sister when she left this office on Friday... she said she didn't feel well and wanted to leave early and I said she could.
{0:24:51 - 0:24:54} {DIALOGUE}: And that was the last I saw...

{0:25:2 - 0:25:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We cut back to her face.
{0:25:2 - 0:25:20} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LOWERY'S VOICE
{0:25:2 - 0:25:20} {DIALOGUE}: After all, Cassidy, I told you... all that cash... I'm not taking the responsibility... Oh, for heaven's sake, a girl works for you for ten years, you trust her!

{0:25:30 - 0:25:33} {DIALOGUE}: I'll track her, never you doubt it!
{0:25:30 - 0:25:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LOWERY'S VOICE
{0:25:33 - 0:25:38} {DIALOGUE}: Hold on, Cassidy... I still can't believe... it must be some kind of a mystery... I can't...

{0:25:38 - 0:25:41} {DIALOGUE}: You checked with the bank, no?

{0:25:41 - 0:25:46} {DIALOGUE}: You still trustin'?

{0:35:22 - 0:35:33} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She takes up a small slice of ham, bites off a tiny bite, nibbles at it in the manner of one disturbed and preoccupied.
{0:35:22 - 0:35:33} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman gazes at her, at the tiny bite she has taken, smiles and then laughs.
{0:35:22 - 0:35:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:35:31 - 0:35:33} {DIALOGUE}: You eat like a bird.
{0:35:31 - 0:35:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:35:35 - 0:35:38} {DIALOGUE}: You'd know, of course.
{0:35:35 - 0:35:40} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:35:38 - 0:35:40} {DIALOGUE}: Not really.
{0:35:40 - 0:35:43} {DIALOGUE}: I hear that expression, that one eats "like a bird," is really a falsie, I mean a falsity, because birds eat a tremendous lot.
{0:35:40 - 0:35:58} {META_DATA}: (A pause, then explaining)
{0:35:53 - 0:35:58} {DIALOGUE}: Oh, I don't know anything about birds.
{0:35:53 - 0:35:58} {DIALOGUE}: My hobby is stuffing things... taxidermy.
{0:36:0 - 0:36:5} {DIALOGUE}: And I guess I'd just rather stuff birds because... well, I hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed, foxes and chimps and all... some people even stuff dogs and cats... but I can't... I think only birds look well stuffed because they're rather... passive, to begin with... most of them...
{0:36:0 - 0:36:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He trails off, his exuberance failing in the rushing return of his natural hesitancy and discomfort.
{0:36:0 - 0:36:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mary looks at him, with some compression, smiles.
{0:36:0 - 0:36:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:36:21 - 0:36:24} {DIALOGUE}: It's a strange hobby.
{0:36:21 - 0:36:24} {DIALOGUE}: Curious, I mean.
{0:36:21 - 0:36:27} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:36:24 - 0:36:27} {DIALOGUE}: Uncommon, too.
{0:36:24 - 0:36:27} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:36:24 - 0:36:27} {DIALOGUE}: I imagine so.
{0:36:24 - 0:36:31} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:36:28 - 0:36:31} {DIALOGUE}: It's not as expensive as you'd think.
{0:36:28 - 0:36:31} {DIALOGUE}: Cheap, really.
{0:36:31 - 0:36:34} {DIALOGUE}: Needles, thread, sawdust .
{0:36:34 - 0:36:37} {DIALOGUE}: the chemicals are all that cost anything.
{0:36:34 - 0:36:40} {META_DATA}: (He goes quiet, looks disturbed)
{0:36:34 - 0:36:40} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:36:37 - 0:36:40} {DIALOGUE}: A man should have a hobby.
{0:36:37 - 0:36:49} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:36:46 - 0:36:49} {DIALOGUE}: It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
{0:36:46 - 0:36:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:36:46 - 0:36:52} {META_DATA}: (after a pause, softly)
{0:36:49 - 0:36:52} {DIALOGUE}: Is your time so empty?
{0:36:49 - 0:37:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:36:49 - 0:37:5} {DIALOGUE}: Oh, no!
{0:36:49 - 0:37:5} {META_DATA}: (forcing brightness again)
{0:37:2 - 0:37:5} {DIALOGUE}: I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
{0:37:2 - 0:37:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:37:5 - 0:37:8} {DIALOGUE}: You go out... with friends?
{0:37:5 - 0:37:13} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:37:5 - 0:37:13} {DIALOGUE}: Friends?
{0:37:5 - 0:37:13} {DIALOGUE}: Who needs friends.
{0:37:5 - 0:37:13} {META_DATA}: (Laughs, then with gallows humor)
{0:37:10 - 0:37:13} {DIALOGUE}: A boy's best friend is his mother.
{0:37:10 - 0:37:20} {META_DATA}: (Stops laughing)
{0:37:16 - 0:37:20} {DIALOGUE}: You've never had an empty moment in your whole life.
{0:37:16 - 0:37:27} {DIALOGUE}: Have you?
{0:37:16 - 0:37:27} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:37:22 - 0:37:27} {DIALOGUE}: Only my share.
{0:37:22 - 0:37:27} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:37:22 - 0:37:27} {DIALOGUE}: Where are you going?
{0:37:27 - 0:37:30} {DIALOGUE}: I don't mean to pry...
{0:37:27 - 0:37:32} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:37:27 - 0:37:32} {META_DATA}: (A wistful smile)
{0:37:30 - 0:37:32} {DIALOGUE}: I'm looking for a private island.
{0:37:30 - 0:37:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:37:35 - 0:37:37} {DIALOGUE}: What are you running away from?
{0:37:35 - 0:37:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:37:35 - 0:37:43} {META_DATA}: (Alert)
{0:37:39 - 0:37:43} {DIALOGUE}: Why do you ask that?
{0:37:39 - 0:37:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:37:39 - 0:37:46} {DIALOGUE}: No.
{0:37:43 - 0:37:46} {DIALOGUE}: People never run away from anything.
{0:37:43 - 0:37:52} {META_DATA}: (A pause)
{0:37:49 - 0:37:52} {DIALOGUE}: The rain didn't last very long.
{0:37:49 - 0:37:52} {META_DATA}: (Turning suddenly)
{0:37:49 - 0:37:52} {DIALOGUE}: You know what I think?
{0:37:57 - 0:37:59} {DIALOGUE}: I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out.
{0:38:9 - 0:38:13} {DIALOGUE}: We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
{0:38:9 - 0:38:20} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:38:18 - 0:38:20} {DIALOGUE}: Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
{0:38:18 - 0:38:26} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:38:23 - 0:38:26} {DIALOGUE}: I was born in mine.
{0:38:23 - 0:38:29} {DIALOGUE}: I don't mind it anymore.
{0:38:23 - 0:38:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:38:26 - 0:38:29} {DIALOGUE}: You should... mind it.
{0:38:26 - 0:38:32} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:38:29 - 0:38:32} {DIALOGUE}: Oh I do... but I say I don't.
{0:38:29 - 0:38:43} {META_DATA}: (Laughs boyishly)
{0:38:29 - 0:38:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:38:29 - 0:38:43} {META_DATA}: (Staring at him, shaking her head softly.)
{0:38:39 - 0:38:43} {DIALOGUE}: If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
{0:38:39 - 0:38:54} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:38:39 - 0:38:54} {META_DATA}: (Controlled resentment)
{0:38:39 - 0:38:54} {DIALOGUE}: Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!
{0:38:39 - 0:38:54} {META_DATA}: (A rueful smile)
{0:38:51 - 0:38:54} {DIALOGUE}: Or at least, defy her.
{0:38:51 - 0:39:3} {META_DATA}: (A pause, a hopeless shrug)
{0:38:51 - 0:39:3} {DIALOGUE}: But I couldn't.
{0:38:58 - 0:39:3} {DIALOGUE}: She's ill.
{0:38:58 - 0:39:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:39:3 - 0:39:7} {DIALOGUE}: She sounded strong...
{0:39:3 - 0:39:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:39:7 - 0:39:9} {DIALOGUE}: I mean... ill.
{0:39:7 - 0:39:15} {META_DATA}: (A pause)
{0:39:11 - 0:39:15} {DIALOGUE}: She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... I was only five... and it must have been a strain.
{0:39:22 - 0:39:27} {DIALOGUE}: Oh, she didn't have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... Mother met a man.
{0:39:31 - 0:39:34} {DIALOGUE}: He talked her into building this motel... We could have talked her into anything... and when.
{0:39:34 - 0:39:38} {DIALOGUE}: Well... It was just too much for her when he died, too... And the way he died... Oh, it's nothing to talk about when you're eating.
{0:39:34 - 0:39:55} {META_DATA}: (Pauses, smiles)
{0:39:34 - 0:39:55} {DIALOGUE}: Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left.
{0:39:34 - 0:39:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:39:34 - 0:39:55} {META_DATA}: (Critically)
{0:39:52 - 0:39:55} {DIALOGUE}: Except you.
{0:39:52 - 0:39:58} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:39:55 - 0:39:58} {DIALOGUE}: A son is a poor substitute for a lover.
{0:39:55 - 0:40:3} {META_DATA}: (Turns away as if in distaste of the word)
{0:39:55 - 0:40:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:40:0 - 0:40:3} {DIALOGUE}: Why don't you go away?
{0:40:0 - 0:40:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:40:3 - 0:40:5} {DIALOGUE}: To a private island, like you?
{0:40:3 - 0:40:12} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:40:8 - 0:40:12} {DIALOGUE}: No, not like me.
{0:40:8 - 0:40:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:40:8 - 0:40:16} {DIALOGUE}: It's too late for me.
{0:40:12 - 0:40:16} {DIALOGUE}: And besides... who'd look after her?
{0:40:23 - 0:40:27} {DIALOGUE}: She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave.
{0:40:27 - 0:40:32} {DIALOGUE}: When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them.
{0:40:34 - 0:40:38} {DIALOGUE}: Oh, I don't hate her.
{0:40:38 - 0:40:42} {DIALOGUE}: I hate... what she's become.
{0:40:38 - 0:40:42} {DIALOGUE}: I hate... the illness.
{0:40:38 - 0:40:49} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:40:38 - 0:40:49} {META_DATA}: (Slowly, carefully)
{0:40:44 - 0:40:49} {DIALOGUE}: Wouldn't it be better if you put her in... someplace...
{0:40:44 - 0:40:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She hesitates.
{0:40:44 - 0:40:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman turns, slowly, looking at her with a striking coldness.
{0:40:44 - 0:40:57} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:40:53 - 0:40:57} {DIALOGUE}: An Institution?
{0:40:53 - 0:40:57} {DIALOGUE}: A madhouse?
{0:40:59 - 0:41:4} {DIALOGUE}: People always call a madhouse "someplace."
{0:40:59 - 0:41:11} {META_DATA}: (Mimicing coldly)
{0:40:59 - 0:41:11} {DIALOGUE}: Put her in Someplace!
{0:40:59 - 0:41:11} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:41:8 - 0:41:11} {DIALOGUE}: I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
{0:41:8 - 0:41:13} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:41:8 - 0:41:13} {META_DATA}: (The coldness turning to tight fury)
{0:41:11 - 0:41:13} {DIALOGUE}: What do you mean about caring?
{0:41:13 - 0:41:17} {DIALOGUE}: Have you ever seen one of those places?
{0:41:13 - 0:41:23} {DIALOGUE}: Inside?
{0:41:20 - 0:41:23} {DIALOGUE}: Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?
{0:41:20 - 0:41:34} {DIALOGUE}: Why?
{0:41:20 - 0:41:34} {DIALOGUE}: has she harmed you?
{0:41:31 - 0:41:34} {DIALOGUE}: She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
{0:41:31 - 0:41:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:41:36 - 0:41:38} {DIALOGUE}: I am sorry.
{0:41:38 - 0:41:43} {DIALOGUE}: I only felt... it seemed she was harming you.
{0:41:44 - 0:41:48} {DIALOGUE}: I meant...
{0:41:44 - 0:41:48} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:41:44 - 0:41:48} {META_DATA}: (High fury now)
{0:41:44 - 0:41:48} {DIALOGUE}: Well?
{0:41:44 - 0:41:52} {DIALOGUE}: You meant well?
{0:41:48 - 0:41:52} {DIALOGUE}: People always mean well, they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that...
{0:41:48 - 0:42:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The fury suddenly dies, abruptly and completely, and he sinks back into his chair.
{0:41:48 - 0:42:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is a brief silence.
{0:41:48 - 0:42:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mary watches the troubled man, is almost physically pained by his anguish.
{0:41:48 - 0:42:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:41:48 - 0:42:5} {META_DATA}: (Quietly)
{0:42:1 - 0:42:5} {DIALOGUE}: I've suggested it myself.
{0:42:5 - 0:42:9} {DIALOGUE}: But I hate to even think such a thing.
{0:42:5 - 0:42:30} {DIALOGUE}: She needs me... and it isn't... (Looks up with a childlike pleading in his eyes) ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad.
{0:42:27 - 0:42:30} {DIALOGUE}: We all go a little mad sometimes.
{0:42:31 - 0:42:34} {DIALOGUE}: Haven't you?
{0:42:31 - 0:42:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:42:31 - 0:42:43} {META_DATA}: (After a long thoughtful pause)
{0:42:38 - 0:42:43} {DIALOGUE}: Yes, and just one time can be enough.
{0:42:38 - 0:42:43} {META_DATA}: (Rises)
{0:42:38 - 0:42:43} {DIALOGUE}: Thank you.
{0:42:38 - 0:42:47} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:42:38 - 0:42:47} {META_DATA}: (Cheerfully, correcting)
{0:42:45 - 0:42:47} {DIALOGUE}: Thank you, Norman.
{0:42:45 - 0:42:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:42:47 - 0:42:50} {DIALOGUE}: Norman.
{0:42:47 - 0:42:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:42:50 - 0:42:53} {DIALOGUE}: You're not going to... to your room already?
{0:42:50 - 0:42:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:42:53 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: I'm very tired.
{0:42:53 - 0:42:59} {DIALOGUE}: And I'll have a long drive tomorrow.
{0:42:56 - 0:42:59} {DIALOGUE}: All the way back to Phoenix.
{0:42:56 - 0:43:4} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:42:56 - 0:43:4} {DIALOGUE}: Phoenix?
{0:42:56 - 0:43:4} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:43:1 - 0:43:4} {DIALOGUE}: I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.
{0:43:1 - 0:43:13} {META_DATA}: (Looking close at Norman)
{0:43:11 - 0:43:13} {DIALOGUE}: Before it's too late for me, too.
{0:43:11 - 0:43:20} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:43:11 - 0:43:20} {META_DATA}: (Looking at her)
{0:43:11 - 0:43:20} {DIALOGUE}: Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
{0:43:11 - 0:43:20} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:43:17 - 0:43:20} {DIALOGUE}: I'd like to, but...
{0:43:17 - 0:43:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:43:17 - 0:43:23} {DIALOGUE}: Alright.
{0:43:20 - 0:43:23} {DIALOGUE}: I'll see you in the morning.
{0:43:23 - 0:43:25} {DIALOGUE}: I'll bring you breakfast.
{0:43:25 - 0:43:28} {DIALOGUE}: What time will you...
{0:43:25 - 0:43:28} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:43:25 - 0:43:28} {DIALOGUE}: Very early.
{0:43:25 - 0:43:28} {DIALOGUE}: Dawn.
{0:43:25 - 0:43:32} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:43:25 - 0:43:32} {DIALOGUE}: Alright, Miss..
{0:43:25 - 0:43:32} {META_DATA}: (He has forgotten her name)
{0:43:25 - 0:43:32} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:43:30 - 0:43:32} {DIALOGUE}: Crane.
{0:43:30 - 0:43:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{0:43:30 - 0:43:35} {DIALOGUE}: That's it.
{0:43:30 - 0:43:35} {META_DATA}: (He frowns, as if bothered by not being able to match the name to the memory of the name in the registration book)
{0:43:30 - 0:43:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MARY
{0:43:32 - 0:43:35} {DIALOGUE}: Good night.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She goes out of the parlor.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see her, from Norman's viewpoint, as she crosses the small office, goes out into the night.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman turns and looks at the table, and we see his face now.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is bright with that drunken-like look of determination and encouragement and like resolve.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He starts to clean up the table, pauses as he hears the closing of Mary's door in the cabin next door.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He holds still, listens.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He goes into the office and looks at the book.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: C.U. - THE NAME "SAMUELS"
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: M.S. - NORMAN
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He goes back into the parlor with a mystified expression.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The sound of Mary moving about her room come over, soft SOUNDS, somehow intimate in the night quiet.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman turns his ear from the direction of the SOUNDS, seems to be fighting an impulse to listen, or more than listen.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But slowly, he is forced to surrender to the impulse and, resisting himself, he goes to the wall, presses the side of his head against it.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The SOUNDS come louder, as if we too had our ear pressed against the wall.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now Norman looks at a picture hanging on the far end of the wall he is leaning against.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Slowly he starts toward it.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He reaches it, touches it, reluctantly lifts the small frame off the wall.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A tiny circle of light hits Norman's face, coming from the hole in the wall behind the picture.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This end of the room is very dim and thus we are able to see clearly the light striking Norman's face.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We move close to Norman, extremely close, until his profile fills the screen.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The tiny spot of light hits his eye.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: See the small hole through which the light comes.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman peeps through.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: NORMAN'S VIEWPOINT
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Through the hole we look into Mary's cabin, see Mary undressing.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She is in her bra and halfslip.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She stoops over a bit, places her hands behind her upper back, begins to unhook her bra.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: NORMAN - ECU
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He watches as Mary removes her bra.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see his eye run up and down the unseen figure of Mary.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: NORMAN'S VIEWPOINT
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mary, just slipping into a robe, covering her complete nudity.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: NORMAN
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns from the hole, faces us for a moment, continues turning until he can look out the small parlor window.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see, as he sees...
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE HOUSE IN THE BACKGROUND
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: NORMAN
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns his face away, quickly, resentfully.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In his face we see anger and anguish.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then resolve.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Quickly, precisely, he rehangs the picture over the hole in the wall, turns, starts out of the parlor.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see him go through the office and out onto the porch, not even bothering to close the door behind him.

{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Once on the path he pauses, looks up at the light in the bedroom window, then pulls himself up, squares his shoulders, strides manfully up the path.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CAMERA follows behind him.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He opens the door of the house, enters.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see him pause at the foot of the stairway, look up at the bedroom door just at the head of the stair.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He holds for a moment, and then his resolve and courage evaporates.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His shoulders slump, sadly, mournfully.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He by- passes the stairs and slowly makes his way to the kitchen.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At the far end of the hall.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He enters the kitchen, drops wearily into a chair.

{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mary is seated at the small desk, engrossed in figuring in a small notebook.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see from these figures a calculation which indicates her intention to make a restitution of the money she has used of the forty thousand dollars.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see, too, her bankbook.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The paper reads thus: top figure, 40,000; directly beneath it 500, the amount used for the new car; total after subtraction, 39,500.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In another spot we see a figure which matches the balance in her bankbook; 624.00.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beneath this is the figure 500, and the amount after subtraction, 124.00.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She studies the figures, sighs, not wearily but with a certain satisfaction, with the pleasure that comes when one knows that at any cost one is going to continue doing the right thing.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After a moment she tears the page out of the notebook and, rising, begins to rip it into small pieces.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She goes into the bathroom, drops the pieces into the toilet bowl, flushes the toilet.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then she drops her robe and steps into the tub and turns the shower on.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. MARY IN SHOWER
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Over the bar on which hangs the shower curtain, we can see the bathroom door, not entirely closed.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For a moment we watch Mary as she washes and soaps herself.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is still a small worry in her eyes, but generally she looks somewhat relieved.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now we see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The noise of the shower drowns out any sound.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The door is then slowly and carefully closed.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And we see the shadow of a woman fall across the shower curtain.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mary's back is turned to the curtain.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The white brightness of the bathroom is almost blinding.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly we see the hand reach up, grasp the shower curtain, rip it aside.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MARY - ECU
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As she turns in response to the feel and SOUND of the shower curtain being torn aside.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A look of pure horror erupts in her face.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A low terrible groan begins to rise up out of her throat.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A hand comes into the shot.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The hand holds an enormous bread knife.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The flint of the blade shatters the screen to an almost total, silver blankness.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE SLASHING
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An impression of a knife slashing, as if tearing at the very screen, ripping the film.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Over it the brief gulps of screaming.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then silence.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then the dreadful thump as Mary's body falls in the tub.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: REVERSE ANGLE
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The blank whiteness, the blur of the shower water, the hand pulling the shower curtain back.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We catch one flicker of a glimpse of the murderer.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A woman, her face contorted with madness, her head wild with hair, as if she were wearing a fright-wig.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then we see only the curtain, closed across the tub, and hear the rush of the shower water.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Above the shower-bar we see the bathroom door open again and after a moment we HEAR the SOUND of the front door slamming.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE DEAD BODY
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lying half in, half out of the tub, the head tumbled over, touching the floor, the hair wet, one eye wide open as if popped, one arm lying limp and wet along the tile floor.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coming down the side of the tub, running thick and dark along the porcelain, we see many small threads of blood.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CAMERA FOLLOWS away from the body, travels slowly across the bathroom, past the toilet, out into the bedroom.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As CAMERA approaches the bed, we see the folded newspaper as Mary placed it on the bedside table.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLOSE UP - THE NEWSPAPER
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: beside the bed.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The CAMERA now moves away over to the window and looks up to the house, and as it gets there we HEAR, coming from within the house, the SOUND of Norman's fearful, shocked voice.
{0:43:32 - 0:49:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN'S VOICE
{0:49:50 - 0:49:52} {DIALOGUE}: Mother!
{0:49:52 - 0:49:56} {DIALOGUE}: Oh God, what... blood, blood... mother...!
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We cannot entirely distinguish these exclamations.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After a moment or two of silence, Norman emerges from the front door, dashes down the path toward the motel.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {META_DATA}: QUICK CUT TO:

{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CAMERA PANS as Norman races past, holds as Norman runs to the porch and quickly along it and directly to Mary's room.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. MARY'S CABIN - (NIGHT)
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman pauses a moment in the doorway, glances about the room, hears the shower going, sees the bathroom door is open.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He goes to the bathroom, looks in, sees the body.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Slowly, almost carefully, he raises his hands to his face, covers his eyes, turns his face away.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he crosses to the window, looks out at the house.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shot is so angled that we see the bedside table with the newspaper on it.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After a moment, Norman moves from the window, sinks onto the edge of the bed.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: FRESH ANGLE - BEHIND NORMAN
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman sitting on bed, the bathroom in b.g. of shot.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We can see only the hand of the dead girl, lying along the tile floor.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman presses his eyes, fights to find a way out of his dilemma.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Slowly, a kind of settling comes upon him, the peace that comes with decision.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman rises, goes to the window, looks out, and then, with resolution, closes the window and draws the curtain across it.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he crosses to the front window, facing the porch, and draws those curtains closed.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he switches off the bedroom light, leaving the room lit only by the spill from the bathroom.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He opens the front door, goes out.

{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We stay outside.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Immediately, the "Vacancy" sign goes off, and then the motel sign goes off.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As CAMERA GOES closer to the office, the lights within go off and we HEAR a closet door opening and then the SOUND of a pail being picked up.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman comes out of office, closes door, looks cautiously about, goes along porch, carrying pail with mop in it, goes into Mary's cabin, closing the door after him.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. MARY'S CABIN
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With the paper in the foreground, Norman enters.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We can see him in the dim spill of light.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pauses by the door, then gathers his strength and goes into the bathroom.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We HEAR him set the pail on the tiled floor, and then we HEAR the shower being turned off.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And there is total silence.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CAMERA MOVES FORWARD so that we can see into bathroom.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CAMERA is ANGLED that we see Norman only from the waist up.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Quickly and deftly he unhooks the shower curtain, emerges with it into the bedroom.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CAMERA PANS down and we see him spread the shower curtain on the bedroom floor, just outside the bathroom door.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He spreads the curtain so that one end of it comes up against the bathroom threshold and slightly over and onto the tile floor.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Again he goes into the bathroom and CAMERA TILTS up so that we see only the upper half of Norman.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He works carefully, with his arms extended away from his body, slowly pulls the dead body out of the tub, drags it across the tile floor and onto the spread-out shower curtain in the bedroom.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Having arranged the body, he straightens up, examines his hands, sees bloodstains on them.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He returns to the bathroom, goes to the hand-basin.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLOSE SHOT
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see his hands being washed, see the bloodstains being diluted and washed away by the gush of the faucet water.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: NORMAN
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see Norman shake his hands free of the water, then turn to the job of cleaning the bathroom.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He places the pail in the tub, runs water into it, dips the mop in, swabs the tile floor.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With a towel he wipes off the wall over the tub and the edges and sides of the tub and even the shower curtain rod.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he takes a second towel and goes over the cleaned areas, carefully drying them.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Finally he rinses and squeezes out the mop, empties the pail, cleans out the tub, and goes out into the bedroom.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. MARY'S BEDROOM
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman steps carefully around the unseen body, crosses to the desk, starts going through Mary's handbag, in search of her car keys.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He suddenly notices them lying on the desk, where he'd thrown them after parking her car.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He picks up the keys, crosses the room, goes out.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. THE PORCH
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see Norman pauses at the door, check cautiously, then hurry across the porch and into Mary's car.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He circle-turns the car, so that its trunk is backed up to the turns porch, directly opposite Mary's door, as close as it can go.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he alights, goes to the trunk, opens it with the key and, leaving the trunk lid raised, goes back into the cabin.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. MARY'S ROOM
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: From a raised angle, we see Norman bend down and begin to wrap the shower curtain around the body.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see the edges of the curtain as they are raised and laid down again.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he picks up the wrapped body, crosses to the door, uses his foot to pull the door open, and, leaving the door open behind him, goes quickly across the porch and gently lays the body in the trunk.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He closes the lid then, but does not lock it.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He comes back into the cabin, closes the door completely, flicks on the light.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Again the newspaper is in the foreground.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For a moment he pauses, closes his eyes against the realization of what he is doing, then quickly pushes all thoughts away, continues with his work.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With the room lighted, he now proceeds to gather up all Mary's articles and toss them into the suitcase.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He checks all drawers and the closet, gets down and checks under bed and bureau, goes into the bathroom, checks that room again, comes back into the bedroom, looks about carefully, spots Mary's handbag, throws even that into the suitcase, is finally satisfied that all traces of the girl are gone from the room.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he closes Mary's suitcase, picks it up.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With his free hand he picks up the pail, in which are the mop and the used towels.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He crosses to the door, switches off the light with his shoulder, pulls open the door, starts out.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. THE PORCH
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Norman stands in the doorway, he is suddenly and blindingly lit by the bright headlights of a passing car.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The flash of the lights and the SOUND of the SPEEDING CAR are over in a flicker of a moment, but it takes a few seconds for Norman to regain his former tense composure.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he goes to the car trunk, raises it with his foot, throws the suitcase and the pail into it, slams it shut.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pauses a moment, then realizes he has left the bathroom light on in Mary's cabin.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He returns to cabin.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he enters, his eye is caught by the newspaper on the bedside table.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He goes to it, takes the newspaper, and looks once again into the bathroom.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His glance goes right over the toilet bowl.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns out the lights, crosses the darkened cabin, goes out onto the porch.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He reopens the trunk, tosses in the newspaper and closes it.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He goes around and jumps into the car and starts away.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We HOLD on the trunk, follow it for a while, then
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {META_DATA}: DISSOLVE TO:
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. THE SWAMP - (NIGHT)
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The car pulls away from a CLOSE ANGLE on the trunk and as CAMERA HOLDS we see that we are now in a swamp area.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is quiet except for the irritating noises of night insects.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman stops the car at the very edge of the swamp, turns off the lights, gets out, leaving door open.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks at the swamp, seems doubtful of its ability to swallow up the car, realizes he has no choice.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He leans into the car, releases the emergency brake, starts to push.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The front of the car begins to roll into the swamp.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly there is the LOW, THROBBING SOUND of a motor.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman freezes, listens.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The SOUND grows louder and Norman realizes it is an airplane flying overhead.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The car is rolling quickly now.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman jumps away, slams the door shut, stands tense.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The SOUND of the plane overhead grows louder.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman looks up.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: NORMAN'S VIEWPOINT - THE BLACK SKY
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see no plane.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The SOUND of the motor is beginning to diminish.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {META_DATA}: CUT BACK TO:
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: NORMAN
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see the relief in his face.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks at the car.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: More than two-thirds of it have already sunk into the swamp.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The trunk alone seems to hold poised above the sand and slime, as if refusing to go the rest of the way.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman begins to panic, he steps dangerously close, pushes with his foot.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And slowly the car sinks, until finally it is gone and we hear only the gentle plop of the swamp's final gulp, and see only the small after-bubble, like a visual burp.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman waits a moment, then begins stamping out the tire marks, so obvious in the wet ground around the swamp.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stamps and drags his feet over the markings as we:
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {META_DATA}: DISSOLVE TO:
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLOSE UP NORMAN
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: standing on the porch of the motel, leaning against a post.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is staring out into the night, a look of guarded, casual innocence on his face, as if he were taking one last moment of peaceful night air before retiring.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he glances down and CAMERA follows his gaze.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A hose is lying on the ground outside Mary's cabin, its stream of water obliterating the tire marks.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After a moment, Norman's hand comes into shot, picks up hose, places it in a new position.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As CAMERA PULLS BACK, we see that the water from the hose has erased and rearranged the road markings so that it would be impossible to tell that a car had been parked here.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After a short wait, Norman goes to the hose-faucet, turns it off, unscrews the hose.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he rolls the hose, he walks away from the spot, past the office, heading for the path that leads to the house.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He goes up the path, pauses at the steps of the house, tosses the curled hose onto the lawn, goes up the steps and into the house.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CAMERA FOLLOWS him in, PAUSES as he pauses at the foot of the stairs.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman goes up the stairs.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On the landing he stops.

{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lying in a heap outside the door are a blood-stained dress and a pair of elderly-woman's shoes.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: From an EXTREMELY HIGH ANGLE, we look down on Norman as he bends to pick up the stained dress and shoes.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He rolls the shoes into the dress, tucks the small, neat bundle under his arm, and starts down the stairs, heading for the basement.

{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: begins with CAMERA IN CLOSE, over Sam's shoulder, and we can read as mush as he has written of the letter.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The letterhead reads "Sam Loomis - Hardware," and the letter reads: "Dearest right-as-always Mary: I'm sitting in this tiny back room which isn't big enough for both of us, and suddenly it looks big enough for both of us.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: So what if we're poor and cramped and miserable, at least we'll be happy!
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: If you haven't come to your senses, and still want to...
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CAMERA begins PULLING AWAY as Sam turns the sheet of paper over, continues backing away out of the small back room and heads, backwards, down the corridor, we see a young clerk, BOB SUMMERFIELD, Sam's assistant, standing behind the counter, a look of handsome patience on his face.
{0:49:52 - 1:0:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is waiting on a meticulous, elderly woman customer, who is holding and examining a large can of insecticide.

{1:0:33 - 1:0:37} {DIALOGUE}: ...They tell you what its ingredients are and how it's guaranteed to exterminate any insect in the world, but they do not tell you whether or not it's painless.

{1:0:40 - 1:1:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CAMERA, by this has reached the front door of the hardware store and we now see a girl standing just inside the door.

{1:1:13 - 1:1:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sam holds a moment, then follows.
{1:1:13 - 1:1:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he reaches her, she turns, her eyes studying him intently as she says:

{1:3:48 - 1:4:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM

{1:3:48 - 1:4:35} {DIALOGUE}: How could I go away?
{1:3:48 - 1:4:35} {DIALOGUE}: I'm in debt up to my... (Smiles at the incongruity of his reply, then goes serious) If she did steal that money... It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would.

{1:3:48 - 1:4:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LILA

{1:3:48 - 1:4:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM

{1:3:48 - 1:4:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LILA
{1:3:48 - 1:4:35} {DIALOGUE}: (A long study, her suspicion of him evaporating) You want me to stay here?
{1:3:48 - 1:4:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM
{1:3:48 - 1:4:35} {DIALOGUE}: She'll need both of us.

{1:3:48 - 1:4:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In his steps and manner there is that bored, routine-logged quality of a man who has seen too many motels and asked question of too many hotel managers over too short a period of time.

{1:4:44 - 1:4:57} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{1:4:44 - 1:4:57} {DIALOGUE}: I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.

{1:4:57 - 1:5:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{1:5:0 - 1:5:3} {DIALOGUE}: No trouble.
{1:5:0 - 1:5:3} {DIALOGUE}: Today's linen day.
{1:5:3 - 1:5:6} {DIALOGUE}: I change all the beds once a week, whether they've been used or not... dampness.

{1:5:12 - 1:5:27} {DIALOGUE}: I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days... What was it you wanted to ask?
{1:5:12 - 1:5:27} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ARBOGAST
{1:5:25 - 1:5:27} {DIALOGUE}: I'm looking for a missing person.
{1:5:25 - 1:5:36} {DIALOGUE}: (takes out and opens wallet and extends it as he speaks) My name's Arbogast, private investigator... (takes back wallet when Norman doesn't look at it) Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week.
{1:5:33 - 1:5:36} {DIALOGUE}: From Phoenix.

{1:5:42 - 1:5:47} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ARBOGAST

{1:5:44 - 1:5:47} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{1:5:44 - 1:5:47} {DIALOGUE}: Oh.
{1:5:44 - 1:5:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He waits a moment, then opens closet, starts counting out sheets and pillow cases, keeps his back to Arbogast.

{1:5:44 - 1:5:54} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ARBOGAST
{1:5:44 - 1:5:54} {DIALOGUE}: We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area... (extends photograph, which Norman doesn't glance at) Did she stop here?
{1:5:44 - 1:5:54} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{1:5:44 - 1:5:54} {DIALOGUE}: No.
{1:5:51 - 1:5:54} {DIALOGUE}: No one has stopped here in weeks...
{1:5:51 - 1:5:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ARBOGAST
{1:5:54 - 1:5:56} {DIALOGUE}: Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
{1:5:54 - 1:5:58} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{1:5:56 - 1:5:58} {DIALOGUE}: Committing myself to what?
{1:5:58 - 1:6:1} {DIALOGUE}: You sure talk like a Policeman.

{1:5:58 - 1:6:8} {DIALOGUE}: At least I don't recall.
{1:5:58 - 1:6:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ARBOGAST
{1:6:6 - 1:6:8} {DIALOGUE}: She might have used an alias.
{1:6:8 - 1:6:10} {DIALOGUE}: Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
{1:6:8 - 1:6:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{1:6:8 - 1:6:24} {META_DATA}: (interrupting)
{1:6:8 - 1:6:24} {DIALOGUE}: I don't even bother with guests registering any more... I mean, little by little, you drop the formalities.
{1:6:8 - 1:6:24} {DIALOGUE}: (more relaxed, because Arbogast is listening with a pleasant smile) I shouldn't even bother to change the linen.
{1:6:21 - 1:6:24} {DIALOGUE}: I guess habits die hard.
{1:6:25 - 1:6:26} {DIALOGUE}: Which reminds me...
{1:6:25 - 1:6:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He goes to the wall, flips a light switch.
{1:6:25 - 1:6:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{1:6:25 - 1:6:30} {DIALOGUE}: The vacancy sign.
{1:6:25 - 1:6:30} {DIALOGUE}: Just in case.
{1:6:25 - 1:6:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We had a couple the other night, said if the sign hasn't been on they'd have thought this was an old deserted mining town or something.
{1:6:25 - 1:6:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ARBOGAST
{1:6:25 - 1:6:30} {DIALOGUE}: Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
{1:6:25 - 1:6:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{1:6:28 - 1:6:30} {DIALOGUE}: What?
{1:6:28 - 1:7:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ARBOGAST
{1:6:28 - 1:7:15} {DIALOGUE}: You thought no one has stopped here in weeks.
{1:6:28 - 1:7:15} {DIALOGUE}: Now, try to remember if this girl...
{1:6:28 - 1:7:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ARBOGAST
{1:6:28 - 1:7:15} {META_DATA}: (A pause, a study)
{1:6:28 - 1:7:15} {DIALOGUE}: Maybe she even signed the register... because habits die hard.
{1:6:28 - 1:7:15} {DIALOGUE}: Let's check it, huh?
{1:6:28 - 1:7:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman says nothing.
{1:6:28 - 1:7:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Arbogast goes to the desk, pulls the registry book around, flips back a page or two.
{1:6:28 - 1:7:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman simply stares at the man.
{1:6:28 - 1:7:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Arbogast hums faintly, pleasantly, as he examines the pages.
{1:6:28 - 1:7:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then:
{1:6:28 - 1:7:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ARBOGAST
{1:6:28 - 1:7:15} {DIALOGUE}: Yes sir!
{1:7:13 - 1:7:15} {DIALOGUE}: Marie Samuels.
{1:7:15 - 1:7:17} {DIALOGUE}: Interesting alias.
{1:7:15 - 1:7:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes a slip of paper out of his pocket, lays it beside the signature in the registry book, all the while nodding and smiling nicely, as if this discovery will make Norman as happy as it is making him.
{1:7:15 - 1:7:25} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ARBOGAST
{1:7:15 - 1:7:25} {DIALOGUE}: Don't know where she got "Marie," but "Samuels" figures.
{1:7:22 - 1:7:25} {DIALOGUE}: Her boy friend's name is Sam.
{1:7:22 - 1:7:30} {META_DATA}: (Turns to Norman, the smile gone)
{1:7:25 - 1:7:30} {DIALOGUE}: Was she in disguise?
{1:7:30 - 1:7:33} {DIALOGUE}: Or do you want to check the picture again?
{1:7:30 - 1:7:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{1:7:33 - 1:7:36} {DIALOGUE}: I didn't lie to you.
{1:7:33 - 1:7:53} {DIALOGUE}: I just have trouble keeping track of... time.

{1:7:33 - 1:7:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{1:7:33 - 1:7:53} {DIALOGUE}: It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
{1:7:33 - 1:7:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ARBOGAST
{1:7:51 - 1:7:53} {DIALOGUE}: Tell me all about her.
{1:7:51 - 1:8:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN

{1:7:51 - 1:8:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ARBOGAST
{1:8:2 - 1:8:5} {DIALOGUE}: How early?

{1:8:24 - 1:8:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ARBOGAST

{1:8:26 - 1:8:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{1:8:26 - 1:8:33} {DIALOGUE}: No!
{1:8:26 - 1:8:33} {DIALOGUE}: Of all...

{1:22:27 - 1:22:36} {DIALOGUE}: He wasn't out when you were there.

{1:24:53 - 1:25:49} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then we hear the cold shot of his mother's derisive laughter.
{1:24:53 - 1:25:49} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MOTHER'S VOICE

{1:34:53 - 1:36:12} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Down at the end of the hall is the kitchen, the door wide open, the room beyond dim and silent.
{1:34:53 - 1:36:12} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She notices the stairs leading down to the basement, stares at them, then back to the stairs leading to the second floor.

{1:34:53 - 1:36:12} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman has the look of one who is protecting himself, as if the counter were a protective wall against the threatening world across it.

{1:36:9 - 1:36:17} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM
{1:36:15 - 1:36:17} {DIALOGUE}: I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance.
{1:36:18 - 1:36:20} {DIALOGUE}: Yet there you are, doing all the listening!
{1:36:18 - 1:36:22} {META_DATA}: (A pause)

{1:36:20 - 1:36:25} {META_DATA}: (As Norman does not reply)
{1:36:22 - 1:36:25} {DIALOGUE}: It would drive me crazy.
{1:36:22 - 1:36:28} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN
{1:36:25 - 1:36:28} {DIALOGUE}: That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?

{1:36:25 - 1:36:33} {META_DATA}: (Lightly)

{1:36:33 - 1:36:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lila is halfway up the stairs.
{1:36:33 - 1:36:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As she climbs she is startled by the creaks and groans of the old wood of the steps.

{1:36:33 - 1:36:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Directly before her is a third door, closed.
{1:36:33 - 1:36:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She holds a long moment, trying to picture in her mind which room would look out on the front of the house, decides, chooses the correct door, the one on her right.
{1:36:33 - 1:36:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She goes to it, knocks lightly.
{1:36:33 - 1:36:42} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. THE MOTHER'S ROOM (DAY) - CLOSE ANGLE ON DOOR
{1:36:33 - 1:36:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We hear Lila's second knock, then, faintly, her soft call.
{1:36:33 - 1:36:42} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LILA'S VOICE (O.S.)
{1:36:39 - 1:36:42} {DIALOGUE}: Mrs. Bates?
{1:36:39 - 1:38:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is quiet for a moment, then the door begins to open, and we see Lila.
{1:36:39 - 1:38:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She stands on the threshold, looking in at the room, instantly disturbed by it, almost chilled, her expression indicating an impulse to close the door and go away from this room forever.
{1:36:39 - 1:38:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After a moment, she enters, leaving the door open behind her.
{1:36:39 - 1:38:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CAMERA PULLS BACK AND AWAY and we now see the room as Lila sees it.
{1:36:39 - 1:38:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is ornate, damask-and-mahogany, thick and warm and ripe, an olla podrida of mismated furnishings and bric-a-brac of the last century.
{1:36:39 - 1:38:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The bed is four poster, but uncanoped; the dressing table is fancy and flounced with satin; there is a great chiffonier, a big-doored wardrobe, a large, oval, full- length pier-glass (this against the wall directly opposite the door), a satin recamier, an upholstered armchair by the window, a white marble fireplace, its grate cold but piled with ashes.
{1:36:39 - 1:38:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And there is in the room an unmistakably live quality, as if even though it is presently unoccupied, it has not been long vacated by some musty presence.
{1:36:39 - 1:38:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lila glances at the bed.
{1:36:39 - 1:38:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The damask coverlet is thrown over it, but it is not neat, there is the imprint of a body on it, a body which obviously has slept in a curled-up, womb- like position.
{1:36:39 - 1:38:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lila stares at it for a moment, up, then goes to the dressing table.
{1:36:39 - 1:38:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Its top is scattered with boxes and jars of cosmetics and creams, traces of fresh powder, an opened bottle or perfume, a comb, and a brush with traces of hair in its bristles.
{1:36:39 - 1:38:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lila moves on, catches a glimpse of herself in the pier-glass, is startled, turns away, goes to the chiffonier, is about to open a drawer, sees the high wardrobe out of the corner of her eyes, goes to it, hesitantly.
{1:36:39 - 1:38:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She opens one door.
{1:36:39 - 1:38:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Fresh, clean, well pressed dresses hang neatly.
{1:36:39 - 1:38:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lila opens the other door.
{1:36:39 - 1:38:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The sweaters and dresses and robes hang freely, none in moth-proof, storage- type bags.
{1:36:39 - 1:38:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is even a well-brushed collar of foxes.
{1:36:39 - 1:38:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Along the floor of the wardrobe is a line of clean, polished shoes.
{1:36:39 - 1:38:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lila stares, then closes the door, turns, looks once again over the whole room, starts out,

{1:36:39 - 1:38:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lila pauses on the threshold, reaches in, feels the wall, throws on a switch.

{1:38:15 - 1:39:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lila is standing in the doorway, staring at the room in sick dismay.
{1:38:15 - 1:39:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The room is grotesque, a horrible, ludicrous fantasy of childhood held beyond the point of decency.
{1:38:15 - 1:39:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is a small room.
{1:38:15 - 1:39:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The walls are fancied with romping silhouettes of teddy-bears and sailboats and carousels and fat cows jumping over aghast moons.
{1:38:15 - 1:39:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The bed is small, far too short for a man of Norman's height.
{1:38:15 - 1:39:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And yet the rumpled covers indicate that it is in this bed that Norman sleeps.
{1:38:15 - 1:39:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Next to the bed is an old-fashioned toy chest.
{1:38:15 - 1:39:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On its top there are a bird-in-a-cage lamp, a plain-bound book, and an ash tray filled with ashes and cigarette stubs.
{1:38:15 - 1:39:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A grown man's shirt hangs on a child's clothes tree.
{1:38:15 - 1:39:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Against one wall there is a narrow, high bookcase filled with thick, unchildish-looking books.
{1:38:15 - 1:39:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On the small, white chest of drawers there is an old, child's victrola.
{1:38:15 - 1:39:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The record on the turntable is discovered, on close inspection, to be Beethoven's Eroica Symphony.
{1:38:15 - 1:39:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lila studies the room, fascinated and repelled.
{1:38:15 - 1:39:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She glances at the bookcase, comes into the room, goes to the bookcase and pulls out a thick, large, plain-bound book.
{1:38:15 - 1:39:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She opens it.
{1:38:15 - 1:39:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her eyes go wide in shock.
{1:38:15 - 1:39:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then there is disgust.
{1:38:15 - 1:39:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She slams the book closed, drops it.

{1:39:39 - 1:39:49} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He crosses the small room, drawn to the rear window, as if he might fly through it.
{1:39:39 - 1:39:49} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sam enters, pauses.
{1:39:39 - 1:39:49} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman turns, back against the window, as unable to fly away as are the many still, stuffed birds.
{1:39:39 - 1:39:49} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sam registers a brief flicker of reaction when he sees the birds, but continues to gaze at Norman, hard.
{1:39:39 - 1:39:49} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM
{1:39:45 - 1:39:49} {DIALOGUE}: I bet your mother knows where the money is.
{1:39:45 - 1:39:53} {DIALOGUE}: And what you did to get it.
{1:39:49 - 1:39:53} {DIALOGUE}: And I think she'll tell us.
{1:39:49 - 1:39:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Something self-assured and confident in Sam's tone gives Norman a new, more terrified alarm.
{1:39:49 - 1:39:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns his head, glances out the window at the old house.
{1:39:49 - 1:39:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks back at Sam and there is terror in his voice.
{1:39:49 - 1:39:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NORMAN

{1:39:53 - 1:39:56} {DIALOGUE}: The girl you came with!

{1:39:53 - 1:41:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sam is lying on the floor, face downward, unmoving.

{1:39:53 - 1:41:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: OVER SHOT comes the SOUND of Norman's footsteps and CAMERA TURNS in time to catch a brief glimpse of him going out into the office, almost at a run.

{1:39:53 - 1:41:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She hears nothing.
{1:39:53 - 1:41:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She starts down the stairs.
{1:39:53 - 1:41:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just below the halfway step, she looks at the front door, sees out through the door window:
{1:39:53 - 1:41:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: LILA'S VIEWPOINT - (DAY)
{1:39:53 - 1:41:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman coming.
{1:39:53 - 1:41:4} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. STAIRWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)
{1:39:53 - 1:41:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For a moment Lila panics, then she hurries down the steps, cannot go in the direction of the front door, remembers the stairway behind her, turns and runs in that direction.
{1:39:53 - 1:41:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The SOUND of Norman bounding up the porch steps can be heard.
{1:39:53 - 1:41:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lila turns and dashes down the stairs which lead to the basement, going down far enough to conceal herself, crouching there.
{1:39:53 - 1:41:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman enters the hallway, closes the door softly, listens.
{1:39:53 - 1:41:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He glances once in the direction of the basement stairs.
{1:39:53 - 1:41:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He seems about to smile, when suddenly all expression vanishes from his face, and he appears to enter a no-place, no-time state.

{1:39:53 - 1:41:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lila remains crouched on the basement stairs, listening to the SOUNDS of Norman.
{1:39:53 - 1:41:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His footsteps on the stairs followed by the fast noises of doors opening, of fast moving about an upstairs room.
{1:39:53 - 1:41:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Convinced that he is searching the upstairs for her, she decides to chance an escape.
{1:39:53 - 1:41:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She starts up the steps, is about to turn into the hallway when her eye is caught by a glimmer of light down in the basement.
{1:39:53 - 1:41:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She pauses, looks down, sees the crack of light coming from behind the not entirely closed door to the fruit cellar.
{1:39:53 - 1:41:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The swift moving SOUNDS of Norman continue to come from upstairs.
{1:39:53 - 1:41:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lila is torn, knows she should get out of the house while she has the chance, is unable to resist the impulse to check that hidden-looking room down below, a room in which, she desperately believes, there must lie some answer to what happened to Mary.
{1:39:53 - 1:41:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She turns and goes softly and quickly down the stairs.

{1:41:1 - 1:41:59} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The movement of this stuffed, ill-preserved cadaver, turning as if in response to Lila's call and touch, is actually graceful, ballet-like, and the effect is terrible and obscene.
{1:41:1 - 1:41:59} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lila gazes for one flicker of a deathly moment, then begins to scream, a high, piercing, dreadful scream.

{1:42:24 - 1:42:28} {DIALOGUE}: He only half-existed to begin with... now, the other half has taken over.

{1:42:28 - 1:42:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LILA
{1:42:28 - 1:42:34} {META_DATA}: (With difficulty)

{1:42:41 - 1:42:43} {DIALOGUE}: Look, if you're trying to lay a lot of psychiatric groundwork for some sort of plea this fellow would like to cop...
{1:42:41 - 1:42:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SIMON
{1:42:43 - 1:42:46} {DIALOGUE}: A psychiatrist doesn't lay the groundwork .

{1:43:10 - 1:43:16} {META_DATA}: (nods, astounded, then:)
{1:43:13 - 1:43:16} {DIALOGUE}: Did he confess to...
{1:43:13 - 1:43:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SIMON
{1:43:13 - 1:43:24} {META_DATA}: (interrupting)
{1:43:13 - 1:43:24} {DIALOGUE}: As I said, the mother...
{1:43:13 - 1:43:24} {META_DATA}: (Pauses, goes on afresh)
{1:43:20 - 1:43:24} {DIALOGUE}: To understand it, as I understood it hearing it from the mother... That is, from the mother-half of Norman's mind, you have to go back ten years... to the time when Norman murdered his mother and her lover.
{1:43:20 - 1:43:38} {META_DATA}: (A pause, then as no one interrupts)
{1:43:33 - 1:43:38} {DIALOGUE}: He was already dangerously disturbed, had been ever since his father died.
{1:43:45 - 1:43:49} {DIALOGUE}: His mother was a clinging, demanding woman... and for years the two of them lived as if there was no one else in the world.
{1:43:53 - 1:43:57} {DIALOGUE}: Then she met a man and it seemed to Norman she "threw him over" for this man.
{1:43:57 - 1:44:1} {DIALOGUE}: That pushed him over the thin line... and he killed them both.
{1:44:1 - 1:44:5} {DIALOGUE}: Matricide is probably the most unbearable crime of all... and most unbearable to the son who commit it.
{1:44:11 - 1:44:16} {DIALOGUE}: So he had to erase the crime, at least in his own mind.
{1:44:11 - 1:44:26} {META_DATA}: (A pause)
{1:44:23 - 1:44:26} {DIALOGUE}: He stole her corpse... and a weighted coffin was buried.
{1:44:29 - 1:44:32} {DIALOGUE}: He hid the body in the fruit cellar, even "treated" it to keep it as well as it would keep.
{1:44:32 - 1:44:35} {DIALOGUE}: And that still wasn't enough.
{1:44:35 - 1:44:39} {DIALOGUE}: She was there, but she was a corpse.
{1:44:44 - 1:44:47} {DIALOGUE}: So he began to think and speak for her, gave her half his life, so to speak.
{1:44:47 - 1:44:52} {DIALOGUE}: At times he could be both personalities, carry on conversations... at other times, the mother-half took over completely.
{1:44:56 - 1:45:1} {DIALOGUE}: He was never all Norman, but he was often only mother.
{1:45:3 - 1:45:6} {DIALOGUE}: And because he was so pathologically jealous of her, he assumed she was as jealous of him.
{1:45:9 - 1:45:14} {DIALOGUE}: Therefore, if he felt a strong attraction to any other woman, the mother side of him would go wild.
{1:45:9 - 1:45:26} {META_DATA}: (To Lila)
{1:45:24 - 1:45:26} {DIALOGUE}: When Norman met your sister, he was touched by her... and aroused by her.
{1:45:26 - 1:45:29} {DIALOGUE}: He wanted her.
{1:45:29 - 1:45:33} {DIALOGUE}: And this set off his "jealous mother" and... "mother killed the girl."
{1:45:36 - 1:45:40} {DIALOGUE}: After the murder, Norman returned as if from a deep sleep... and like a dutiful son, covered up all traces of the crime he was convinced his mother had committed.
{1:45:36 - 1:45:49} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM
{1:45:46 - 1:45:49} {DIALOGUE}: Why was he... dressed like that?
{1:45:46 - 1:45:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DISTRICT ATTORNEY
{1:45:49 - 1:45:52} {DIALOGUE}: He's a transvestite!
{1:45:49 - 1:45:54} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SIMON
{1:45:52 - 1:45:54} {DIALOGUE}: Not exactly.
{1:45:55 - 1:45:58} {DIALOGUE}: A man who dresses in woman's clothing in order to achieve a sexual change... or satisfaction... is a transvestite.
{1:46:5 - 1:46:8} {DIALOGUE}: But in Norman's case, he was simply doing everything possible to keep alive the illusion of his mother being alive.
{1:46:22 - 1:46:26} {DIALOGUE}: And whenever reality came too close, when danger or desire threatened that illusion, he'd dress up, even to a cheap wig he brought, and he'd walk about the house, sit in her chair, speak in her voice... He tried to be his mother.
{1:46:22 - 1:46:33} {META_DATA}: (A sad smile)
{1:46:29 - 1:46:33} {DIALOGUE}: And now he is.
{1:46:29 - 1:46:38} {META_DATA}: (A pause)
{1:46:33 - 1:46:38} {DIALOGUE}: That's what I meant when I said I got the story from the mother.
{1:46:33 - 1:46:42} {DIALOGUE}: She thinks Norman has been taken away... because of his crimes.
{1:46:33 - 1:46:42} {DIALOGUE}: She insists she did nothing, that Norman committed all the murders just to keep her from being discovered.
{1:46:33 - 1:46:42} {DIALOGUE}: She even smiled a bit coquettishly as she said that.
{1:46:33 - 1:46:42} {DIALOGUE}: Of course, she feels badly about it... but also somewhat relieved to be, as she put it, free of Norman, at last.
{1:46:33 - 1:46:42} {META_DATA}: (A pause)
{1:46:38 - 1:46:42} {DIALOGUE}: When the mind houses two personalities, there is always a battle.
{1:46:49 - 1:46:51} {DIALOGUE}: In Norman's case, the battle is over... and the dominant personality has won.
{1:46:49 - 1:46:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lila begins to weep softly, for Mary, for Arbogast, for Norman, for all the destroyed human beings of this world.
{1:46:49 - 1:46:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sam bends beside her, puts his arm about her, comforts her.

{1:46:56 - 1:46:59} {DIALOGUE}: The swamp.
{1:46:56 - 1:46:59} {DIALOGUE}: These were murders of passion, not profit.
{1:46:56 - 1:47:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A POLICE GUARD puts his head in the door, speaks, in a near- whisper, to the Chief of Police.
{1:46:56 - 1:47:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Guard is carrying a folded blanket over his arm.
{1:46:56 - 1:47:4} {CHARACTER_NAME}: POLICE GUARD
{1:47:1 - 1:47:4} {DIALOGUE}: He feels a little chill... can I bring him this blanket?
{1:47:1 - 1:47:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Chief of Police nods.
{1:47:1 - 1:47:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Guard goes away, and CAMERA FOLLOWS him out of the room and out into the hallway.

{1:47:1 - 1:47:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In f.g. of shot, we see a door, the top half of which is wire-covered glass.
{1:47:1 - 1:47:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A GUARD in uniform is posted by the door, looking reprovingly at the two or three people trying to get a glance into the room.
{1:47:1 - 1:47:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Police Guard, carrying the blanket, comes down this corridor, goes to the door.
{1:47:1 - 1:47:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CAMERA MOVES CLOSE.
{1:47:1 - 1:47:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The uniformed Guard opens the door, allows the man to go in.
{1:47:1 - 1:47:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shot is RAKED so that we can not see into the room.
{1:47:1 - 1:47:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After a moment, the Guard comes out and the uniformed Guard closes and locks the door and we
{1:47:1 - 1:47:38} {META_DATA}: CUT TO:

{1:47:1 - 1:47:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Police Guard has placed the blanket on Norman's knees.
{1:47:1 - 1:47:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman, as we come upon him, is lifting the blanket, unfolding it.
{1:47:1 - 1:47:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His face, although without makeup and without the surrounding softness of the wig, has a certain femininity about it, a softness about the mouth and a kind of arch womanliness about the brows.
{1:47:1 - 1:47:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Calmly, Norman places the blanket about his shoulders, as if it were a cashmere shawl.
{1:47:1 - 1:47:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CAMERA REMAINS in a position so that our view of Norman is a FULL ONE.
{1:47:1 - 1:47:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When the shawl is in position, and Norman is settled, we HEAR, OVER SHOT, the voice of his mother, coming from the calm of his thoughts.
{1:47:1 - 1:47:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MOTHER'S VOICE (O.S.)
{1:47:34 - 1:47:38} {DIALOGUE}: It's sad... when a mother has to speak the words that condemn her own son... but I couldn't allow them to believe that I would commit murder.
{1:47:34 - 1:47:42} {META_DATA}: (A pause)
{1:47:38 - 1:47:42} {DIALOGUE}: They'll put him away now... as I should have... years ago.
{1:47:42 - 1:47:45} {DIALOGUE}: He was always... bad.
{1:47:45 - 1:47:50} {DIALOGUE}: And in the end, he intended to tell them I killed those girls... and that man.
{1:47:50 - 1:47:54} {DIALOGUE}: As if I could do anything except just sit and stare... like one of his stuffed birds.
{1:47:50 - 1:48:0} {META_DATA}: (A pause)
{1:47:57 - 1:48:0} {DIALOGUE}: Well, they know I can't even move a finger.
{1:47:57 - 1:48:6} {DIALOGUE}: And I won't.
{1:48:0 - 1:48:6} {DIALOGUE}: I'll just sit here and be quiet.
{1:48:0 - 1:48:6} {DIALOGUE}: Just in case they do... suspect me.
{1:48:0 - 1:48:13} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A fly buzzes close, and then continues buzzing and flying about Norman's face.
{1:48:0 - 1:48:13} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MOTHER'S VOICE (V.O.)
{1:48:9 - 1:48:13} {DIALOGUE}: They're probably watching me.
{1:48:9 - 1:48:13} {DIALOGUE}: Well, let them.
{1:48:13 - 1:48:17} {DIALOGUE}: Let them see what kind of a person I am.
{1:48:17 - 1:48:19} {DIALOGUE}: (A pause, as the fly lights on Norman's hand) I'm not going to swat that fly.
{1:48:19 - 1:48:23} {DIALOGUE}: I hope they are watching.
{1:48:25 - 1:48:30} {DIALOGUE}: They'll see... they'll see... and they'll know... and they'll say... 'why, she wouldn't even harm a fly...'
{1:48:25 - 1:48:31} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norman continues to gaze ahead into nothing.
{1:48:25 - 1:48:31} {META_DATA}: SCENE BEGINS TO DISSOLVE SLOWLY TO:
{1:48:25 - 1:48:31} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE SWAMP
{1:48:25 - 1:48:31} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As END TITLES FADE IN, we see the swamp, the chain of a tow- truck.
{1:48:25 - 1:48:31} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The chain is attached to Mary's car.
{1:48:25 - 1:48:31} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The car is coming out of the swamp.
{1:48:25 - 1:48:31} {META_DATA}: FADE OUT
{1:48:25 - 1:48:31} {META_DATA}: THE END
