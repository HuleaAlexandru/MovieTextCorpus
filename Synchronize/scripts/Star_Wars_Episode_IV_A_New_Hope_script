{0:9:53 - 0:9:55} {DIALOGUE}: Go that way!
{0:9:55 - 0:9:58} {DIALOGUE}: You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile!
{0:9:55 - 0:10:1} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the direction of the vast dune sea.
{0:9:55 - 0:10:1} {CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{0:9:58 - 0:10:1} {DIALOGUE}: And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it.

{0:10:18 - 0:10:57} {CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{0:10:54 - 0:10:57} {DIALOGUE}: That malfunctioning little twerp.
{0:10:54 - 0:10:57} {DIALOGUE}: This is all his fault!
{0:10:58 - 0:11:0} {DIALOGUE}: He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.

{0:10:58 - 0:11:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving towards him.

{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: You ought to take it easy Luke.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: Look who's talking.

{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: Luke, I didn't come back just to say good-bye... I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust... and if I don't come back, I want somebody to know.

{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: You could wander around forever trying to find them.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what I can on my own... It's what we always talked about.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side -- the side I believe in.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE

{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS

{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: Not likely!

{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: He needs me for just one more season.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: I can't leave him now.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: ... You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems... it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: It couldn't happen here.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: You said it yourself.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: The Empire won't bother with this rock.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS

{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE

{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: No, I'm leaving in the morning...
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: Then I guess I won't see you.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: Maybe someday... I'll keep a lookout.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure... Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {DIALOGUE}: So long, Luke.

{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures fill the air.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he goes.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for a moment.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall and a small dark figure darts into the shadows.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A little further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the narrow path.
{0:11:15 - 0:15:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow.

{0:25:25 - 0:25:28} {DIALOGUE}: Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.

{0:28:25 - 0:28:33} {DIALOGUE}: If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.

{0:28:52 - 0:30:10} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He can be heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles down the side of the mountain.

{0:30:55 - 0:30:56} {DIALOGUE}: I think he's searching for his former master... I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems to be no stopping him.
{0:31:1 - 0:31:4} {DIALOGUE}: He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.
{0:31:4 - 0:31:7} {DIALOGUE}: Is he a relative of yours?

{0:31:39 - 0:31:42} {DIALOGUE}: I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.
{0:31:39 - 0:31:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE

{0:35:31 - 0:35:34} {DIALOGUE}: You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.
{0:35:35 - 0:35:37} {DIALOGUE}: This is our most desperate hour.

{0:36:1 - 0:36:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{0:36:5 - 0:36:8} {DIALOGUE}: I need your help, Luke.
{0:36:5 - 0:36:8} {DIALOGUE}: She needs your help.

{0:36:8 - 0:36:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{0:36:16 - 0:36:19} {DIALOGUE}: I can't get involved!
{0:36:16 - 0:36:19} {DIALOGUE}: I've got work to do!
{0:36:20 - 0:36:22} {DIALOGUE}: It's not that I like the Empire.
{0:36:20 - 0:36:22} {DIALOGUE}: I hate it!
{0:36:22 - 0:36:24} {DIALOGUE}: But there's nothing I can do about it right now.
{0:36:26 - 0:36:29} {DIALOGUE}: It's such a long way from here.
{0:36:26 - 0:36:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{0:36:26 - 0:36:29} {DIALOGUE}: That's your uncle talking.
{0:36:26 - 0:36:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE

{0:36:33 - 0:36:44} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE

{0:36:50 - 0:37:4} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. SPACE.
{0:36:50 - 0:37:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An Imperial Stardestroyer heads toward the evil planet-like battle station: the Death Star!

{0:36:50 - 0:37:4} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TAGGE
{0:37:0 - 0:37:4} {DIALOGUE}: Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable.
{0:37:4 - 0:37:6} {DIALOGUE}: The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.
{0:37:6 - 0:37:8} {DIALOGUE}: They're more dangerous than you realize.
{0:37:6 - 0:37:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.
{0:37:6 - 0:37:11} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MOTTI
{0:37:8 - 0:37:11} {DIALOGUE}: Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station!
{0:37:8 - 0:37:17} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TAGGE
{0:37:13 - 0:37:17} {DIALOGUE}: The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as....
{0:37:13 - 0:37:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut short and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial outland regions, enters.

{0:37:13 - 0:37:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All of the generals stand and bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his place at the head of the table.
{0:37:13 - 0:37:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Dark Lord stands behind him.
{0:37:13 - 0:37:21} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TARKIN
{0:37:17 - 0:37:21} {DIALOGUE}: The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.
{0:37:21 - 0:37:25} {DIALOGUE}: I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently.
{0:37:26 - 0:37:29} {DIALOGUE}: The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.
{0:37:26 - 0:37:31} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TAGGE
{0:37:30 - 0:37:31} {DIALOGUE}: That's impossible!
{0:37:31 - 0:37:34} {DIALOGUE}: How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?
{0:37:31 - 0:37:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TARKIN
{0:37:34 - 0:37:38} {DIALOGUE}: The regional governors now have direct control over territories.
{0:37:39 - 0:37:43} {DIALOGUE}: Fear will keep the local systems in line.

{0:37:43 - 0:37:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TAGGE

{0:37:46 - 0:37:49} {DIALOGUE}: If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.
{0:37:46 - 0:37:58} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{0:37:54 - 0:37:58} {DIALOGUE}: The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
{0:37:54 - 0:38:2} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MOTTI
{0:37:58 - 0:38:2} {DIALOGUE}: Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained.
{0:38:5 - 0:38:8} {DIALOGUE}: This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.
{0:38:9 - 0:38:11} {DIALOGUE}: I suggest we use it!
{0:38:9 - 0:38:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{0:38:11 - 0:38:15} {DIALOGUE}: Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.
{0:38:15 - 0:38:18} {DIALOGUE}: The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
{0:38:15 - 0:38:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MOTTI
{0:38:21 - 0:38:24} {DIALOGUE}: Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.
{0:38:27 - 0:38:30} {DIALOGUE}: Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort...
{0:38:27 - 0:38:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader's spell.
{0:38:27 - 0:38:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{0:38:41 - 0:38:43} {DIALOGUE}: I find your lack of faith disturbing.
{0:38:41 - 0:38:47} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TARKIN
{0:38:45 - 0:38:47} {DIALOGUE}: Enough of this!
{0:38:45 - 0:38:47} {DIALOGUE}: Vader, release him!
{0:38:45 - 0:38:49} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{0:38:48 - 0:38:49} {DIALOGUE}: As you wish.
{0:38:48 - 0:38:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TARKIN
{0:38:51 - 0:38:53} {DIALOGUE}: This bickering is pointless.
{0:38:54 - 0:38:58} {DIALOGUE}: Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational.
{0:39:1 - 0:39:4} {DIALOGUE}: We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.

{0:39:12 - 0:39:15} {DIALOGUE}: Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.
{0:39:15 - 0:39:18} {DIALOGUE}: It's just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.
{0:39:15 - 0:39:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.
{0:39:15 - 0:39:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{0:39:15 - 0:39:22} {DIALOGUE}: They didn't.
{0:39:18 - 0:39:22} {DIALOGUE}: But we are meant to think they did.
{0:39:22 - 0:39:24} {DIALOGUE}: These tracks are side by side.
{0:39:24 - 0:39:28} {DIALOGUE}: Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers.
{0:39:24 - 0:39:31} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{0:39:28 - 0:39:31} {DIALOGUE}: These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.
{0:39:28 - 0:39:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{0:39:31 - 0:39:35} {DIALOGUE}: And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople.
{0:39:36 - 0:39:40} {DIALOGUE}: Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
{0:39:36 - 0:39:42} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{0:39:40 - 0:39:42} {DIALOGUE}: Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?
{0:39:40 - 0:39:51} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio are inspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together.
{0:39:40 - 0:39:51} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{0:39:48 - 0:39:51} {DIALOGUE}: If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to.
{0:39:51 - 0:39:53} {DIALOGUE}: And that would lead them home!
{0:39:51 - 0:39:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for the speeder and jumps it.
{0:39:51 - 0:39:54} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{0:39:53 - 0:39:54} {DIALOGUE}: Wait, Luke!
{0:39:54 - 0:39:56} {DIALOGUE}: It's too dangerous.
{0:39:54 - 0:40:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke races off leaving Ben and the two robots alone with the burning Sandcrawler.

{0:41:16 - 0:42:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{0:42:4 - 0:42:7} {DIALOGUE}: There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there.
{0:42:8 - 0:42:10} {DIALOGUE}: You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire.
{0:42:8 - 0:42:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{0:42:14 - 0:42:16} {DIALOGUE}: I want to come with you to Alderaan.
{0:42:17 - 0:42:19} {DIALOGUE}: There's nothing here for me now.

{1:0:16 - 1:0:21} {CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{1:0:18 - 1:0:21} {DIALOGUE}: But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
{1:0:18 - 1:0:25} {CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{1:0:21 - 1:0:25} {DIALOGUE}: That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.

{1:0:26 - 1:0:31} {CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO

{1:1:7 - 1:1:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{1:1:12 - 1:1:15} {DIALOGUE}: You don't believe in the Force, do you?
{1:1:12 - 1:1:17} {CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{1:1:15 - 1:1:17} {DIALOGUE}: Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.
{1:1:19 - 1:1:22} {DIALOGUE}: I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.

{1:1:37 - 1:1:48} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{1:1:37 - 1:1:48} {META_DATA}: (laughing)
{1:1:45 - 1:1:48} {DIALOGUE}: With the blast shield down, I can't even see.
{1:1:45 - 1:1:48} {DIALOGUE}: How am I supposed to fight?
{1:1:45 - 1:1:51} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{1:1:48 - 1:1:51} {DIALOGUE}: Your eyes can deceive you.

{1:2:17 - 1:2:21} {CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{1:2:19 - 1:2:21} {DIALOGUE}: I call it luck.
{1:2:19 - 1:2:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{1:2:21 - 1:2:24} {DIALOGUE}: In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.
{1:2:21 - 1:2:26} {CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{1:2:24 - 1:2:26} {DIALOGUE}: Look, going good against remotes is one thing.
{1:2:24 - 1:2:29} {DIALOGUE}: Going good against the living?
