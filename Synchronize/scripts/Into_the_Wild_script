{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: Your humble reporter, Chris McCandless will now struggle with the journalistic question of ethics: Will he retain his reporter's objectiveness or save the future of human truth by slaying this awful beast?
{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He gives us a look of vaudevillian puzzlement - what will he do?

{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRIS
{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: Ted!
{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: I know how to kill it.
{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: And I'm the only one who knows.
{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: You can't keep sending me on stories and expecting me to do nothing!

{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: The CAMERA RUNS WITH HIM out the door, through the corridor, up a set of steps to the hatchway.

{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {META_DATA}: (into camera)
{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: This is the only thing that can kill the monster.

{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CAMERA TILTS UP to the monster looking out the hatchway, slowly dying from the song being sung.
{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the song continues to be sung and the monster continues to die, the AUDIO RECEDES and VIDEO IMAGES GO TO SLO MO.
{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CARINE (V.O.)
{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: When we were little, Chris was very to himself.
{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: He wasn't anti-social, he always had friends, and everybody liked him - but he could go off and entertain himself for hours, he didn't seem to need toys or friends.
{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: He could be alone without being lonely.
{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: The secrets our parents kept, though unknown to Chris and I, led to bouts of rage and even violence between them that we had been forced to witness since we were very young.
{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: It seemed like they never fought without us.
{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: I remember the first family meeting to let Chris and me in on their plans for getting a divorce.
{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: They wanted us to choose which of them we'd live with.
{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: I cried my eyes out.
{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: But the divorce never happened, though the threats and meetings never stopped.
{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: It wasn't long before Chris and I shut off -- we would tell mom and dad to go ahead and get the divorce.
{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: Chris and I just wanted to get away from their fights and mom kept promising to get out and take us with her as soon as their company made enough money.
{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: Dad had been the young genius [that] NASA enlisted to do [crucial] designs for the American satellite radar systems that would be our answer to the Russian Sputnik.
{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: And mom and he later started up a consulting firm combining her get-up- and-go resourcefulness with his wealth of knowledge.
{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: By the time the company actually made its first million, the careerism and money seemed to erase her memory of the promise she'd made us.

{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: I think this is when Chris began to see "careers" as a diseased invention of the twentieth century and to resent money and the useless priority people made of it in their lives.
{0:20:10 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: He'd begun planning to "slay the beast"...to make himself free.

{0:40:17 - 0:43:25} {DIALOGUE}: And that one lie had led to another.
{0:40:17 - 0:43:25} {DIALOGUE}: That two years after Chris was born, dad had had another son with Marcia.
{0:40:17 - 0:43:25} {DIALOGUE}: Worse yet was that it was Marcia to whom he was still legally married at the time.

{0:40:17 - 0:43:25} {DIALOGUE}: Chris submitted to dad's authority through college but I knew he raged inwardly the whole time.
{0:40:17 - 0:43:25} {DIALOGUE}: It was inevitable that Chris would rebel.
{0:40:17 - 0:43:25} {DIALOGUE}: And when he did, he did it with characteristic immoderation.

{1:22:34 - 1:23:9} {DIALOGUE}: It's all she can do to examine the snapshots.
{1:22:34 - 1:23:9} {DIALOGUE}: And, though she breaks down from time to time, she studies them with a sort of hungry intensity - like looking at food you can't eat, or into a window at a family around a table that you were once a part of and can be no more.
