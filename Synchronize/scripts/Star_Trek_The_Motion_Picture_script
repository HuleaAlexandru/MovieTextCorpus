{0:10:48 - 0:12:5} {DIALOGUE}: One hour!
{0:10:48 - 0:12:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And Kirk turns, strides purposefully away.
{0:10:48 - 0:12:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sonak gazes after him, one eyebrow raised quizzically.

{0:10:48 - 0:12:5} {DIALOGUE}: Admiral, I've been hoping to see you.

{0:12:14 - 0:12:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Scott is now eying Kirk just a little warily as he fol- lows him into the pod.
{0:12:14 - 0:12:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk's determined expression suggests that some chips are going to fly and Scott does not want to become one of them.
{0:12:14 - 0:12:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTT

{0:12:33 - 0:12:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Scott nervously eying Kirk, and finally deciding to make one more effort:
{0:12:33 - 0:12:58} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTT
{0:12:56 - 0:12:58} {DIALOGUE}: The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment.
{0:13:1 - 0:13:6} {DIALOGUE}: And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power.
{0:13:6 - 0:13:8} {DIALOGUE}: Add to that, an untried Captain...
{0:13:6 - 0:13:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{0:13:6 - 0:13:15} {META_DATA}: (hint of smile)
{0:13:12 - 0:13:15} {DIALOGUE}: Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
{0:13:12 - 0:13:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It takes Scott a moment to comprehend, and Kirk smiles now, nods:
{0:13:12 - 0:13:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{0:13:12 - 0:13:22} {META_DATA}: (continuing)

{0:13:19 - 0:13:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTT
{0:13:19 - 0:13:22} {DIALOGUE}: "Gave' her back, sir...?
{0:13:22 - 0:13:24} {DIALOGUE}: I doubt it was that easy...
{0:13:22 - 0:13:33} {META_DATA}: (returns smile)
{0:13:29 - 0:13:33} {DIALOGUE}: But any man who could manage such a feat, I wouldna dare disappoint.
{0:13:36 - 0:13:40} {DIALOGUE}: She'll launch on time, sir...
{0:13:36 - 0:18:31} {META_DATA}: (with confidence)
{0:13:36 - 0:18:31} {DIALOGUE}: And she'll be ready.
{0:13:36 - 0:18:31} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And he clasps Kirk's elbow affectionately, then gestures Kirk to look out the pod window.

{0:13:36 - 0:18:31} {META_DATA}: 52 WHAT THEY SEE - THE ENTERPRISE (S)
{0:13:36 - 0:18:31} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now DOMINATING the SCREEN -- the awesome, symmetrical bulk of the starship comes fully INTO VIEW.

{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There will be continual AD LIBBED conversation among the Technicians.
{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now the Engine Room door opens and Kirk steps into the area.
{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stands a moment observing the activity.
{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: a grizzled ENGINEERING CHIEF pushes a huge condenser on an anti-grav device past irk with a respectful "watch it, sir" admonishment.
{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk moves on to:
{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {META_DATA}: 71 THE INTERMIX CHAMBER
{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: at the middle of the power shaft.
{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Very NOISY here, and a continual CACOPHONY of COMPUTERIZED AND HUMAN VOICES calling off equipment checks.
{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And grouped around a section of burnt-out circuitry are WILLARD DECKER, Captain's stripes, handsome, in his early 30's; Scott, and two Technicians.
{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Decker and Scott are working feverishly uncoupling the device, probing its innards.
{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Decker has discovered the problem, removed several transistor-type parts, taps them with a pencil-sized sonic analyzer.
{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {META_DATA}: (quietly elated)
{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {DIALOGUE}: I thought so!
{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {DIALOGUE}: See... the trans- porter sensor was not activated...
{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTT
{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {META_DATA}: (impressed)
{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {DIALOGUE}: Aye, you were dead right about that...
{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {META_DATA}: (to Technician)
{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {DIALOGUE}: Clearly, put a back-up sensor into the unit.
{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {META_DATA}: 72 ACROSS THEM TO KIRK
{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as the Technician prepares to install the device, Scott glances up to see Kirk.
{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks from Decker to Kirk in acute embarrassment (so that we should realize Scott hasn't mentioned Kirk's taking over to Decker).
{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Decker now notices Kirk, reacts pleased.
{0:19:57 - 0:20:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{0:20:51 - 0:20:53} {DIALOGUE}: Admiral Kirk...
{0:20:51 - 0:20:53} {META_DATA}: (shakes Kirk's hand)
{0:20:51 - 0:20:53} {DIALOGUE}: We're getting a top brass send off...?
{0:20:51 - 0:20:58} {META_DATA}: (self assured grin)
{0:20:56 - 0:20:58} {DIALOGUE}: She'll launch on schedule if we have to tow her out with our bare hands.
{0:20:56 - 0:21:4} {DIALOGUE}: Right, Scotty?
{0:20:56 - 0:21:4} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTTY
{0:20:56 - 0:21:4} {META_DATA}: (lamely)
{0:20:56 - 0:21:4} {DIALOGUE}: Aye, sir, that we will...

{0:20:56 - 0:21:4} {META_DATA}: (to Decker)
{0:21:2 - 0:21:4} {DIALOGUE}: Will, let's go over here and talk.
{0:21:2 - 0:21:10} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He indicates corner.
{0:21:2 - 0:21:10} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Decker glances bemusedly at Kirk, then turns to Scott:
{0:21:2 - 0:21:10} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{0:21:2 - 0:21:10} {DIALOGUE}: Let me now when the back-up is in place.
{0:21:2 - 0:21:10} {META_DATA}: 73 ACROSS SCOTT TO KIRK AND DECKER
{0:21:2 - 0:21:10} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as Scott AD LIBS a glum "Aye, sir," and watches them walk across the Chamber.
{0:21:2 - 0:21:10} {META_DATA}: 74 A CORNER OF THE INTERMIX CHAMBER
{0:21:2 - 0:21:10} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: just a little quieter here, with Kirk and Decker arriv- ing, and Decker saying blithely:
{0:21:2 - 0:21:10} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{0:21:7 - 0:21:10} {DIALOGUE}: All due respect, sir, I hope this isn't a Starfleet pep talk; I'm just too busy.
{0:21:7 - 0:21:13} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk eyes Decker -- then decides the best way to say it is plainly, directly.
{0:21:7 - 0:21:13} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{0:21:10 - 0:21:13} {DIALOGUE}: I'm taking over the Center seat.
{0:21:10 - 0:21:17} {DIALOGUE}: I'm sorry, Will.
{0:21:10 - 0:21:17} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{0:21:10 - 0:21:17} {DIALOGUE}: You are what...?
{0:21:10 - 0:21:17} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{0:21:15 - 0:21:17} {DIALOGUE}: I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.
{0:21:15 - 0:21:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Decker seems shocked into silence; he can only peer at Kirk who reaches tentatively as though to clasp a paternal hand on Decker's shoulder, then withdraws it and continues quickly.
{0:21:15 - 0:21:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{0:21:15 - 0:21:23} {META_DATA}: (continuing)
{0:21:20 - 0:21:23} {DIALOGUE}: You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.

{0:21:20 - 0:21:27} {META_DATA}: (finding his voice)
{0:21:25 - 0:21:27} {DIALOGUE}: -- You, personally, are assuming command?
{0:21:25 - 0:21:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{0:21:25 - 0:21:33} {DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{0:21:25 - 0:21:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{0:21:29 - 0:21:33} {DIALOGUE}: May I ask Why?
{0:21:29 - 0:21:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{0:21:29 - 0:21:37} {META_DATA}: (nods)
{0:21:33 - 0:21:37} {DIALOGUE}: My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
{0:21:33 - 0:21:42} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{0:21:39 - 0:21:42} {DIALOGUE}: Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise.
{0:21:42 - 0:21:44} {DIALOGUE}: You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
{0:21:42 - 0:21:47} {META_DATA}: 75 ANOTHER ANGLE - TO SHOW SCOTT IN B.G. (ACROSS THE
{0:21:42 - 0:21:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ROOM)
{0:21:42 - 0:21:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Scott, working on the relay, but continually glancing at Kirk and Decker with worried concern, as Kirk replies:
{0:21:42 - 0:21:47} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{0:21:44 - 0:21:47} {DIALOGUE}: That's why you're staying aboard.
{0:21:52 - 0:21:53} {DIALOGUE}: I'm sorry, Will.
{0:21:52 - 0:21:57} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{0:21:54 - 0:21:57} {DIALOGUE}: No, Admiral.
{0:21:57 - 0:21:59} {DIALOGUE}: I don't think you are; not one damned bit.
{0:22:1 - 0:22:3} {DIALOGUE}: I remember when you recommended me for this command.
{0:22:5 - 0:22:7} {DIALOGUE}: You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again.
{0:22:10 - 0:22:14} {DIALOGUE}: Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
{0:22:10 - 0:22:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk is silent a moment, peering levelly at Decker, who returns the gaze with equal intensity.
{0:22:10 - 0:22:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then:
{0:22:10 - 0:22:21} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{0:22:17 - 0:22:21} {DIALOGUE}: Report to the bridge, Commander.
{0:22:17 - 0:22:38} {DIALOGUE}: Immediately.
{0:22:17 - 0:22:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Decker EXITS.
{0:22:17 - 0:22:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk waits, collecting his composure as he watches him go.
{0:22:17 - 0:22:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then Kirk turns to glare at Scott.
{0:22:17 - 0:22:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Interrupted by a flare as something shorts out at the mechanism where Scott and Decker had been working.
{0:22:17 - 0:22:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Technician (Clearly) reacts, hits an inter- com button fast:
{0:22:17 - 0:22:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TECHNICIAN (CLEARY)
{0:22:36 - 0:22:38} {DIALOGUE}: Transporter room, come in!
{0:22:36 - 0:22:38} {DIALOGUE}: Urgent!

{0:22:38 - 0:22:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Scott whirls to a console fast, speaks urgently!
{0:22:38 - 0:22:42} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTT
{0:22:40 - 0:22:42} {DIALOGUE}: Transporter room, do not engage!
{0:22:42 - 0:22:44} {DIALOGUE}: Do not....
{0:22:42 - 0:22:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TECHNICIAN (CLEARY)
{0:22:42 - 0:22:50} {META_DATA}: (reacting to the reading; interruption)
{0:22:42 - 0:22:50} {DIALOGUE}: Too late; they're beaming now!
{0:22:42 - 0:22:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk is exiting on a run, followed by Scott.
{0:22:42 - 0:22:50} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 76 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - INCLUDING TRANSPORTER CHAMBER
{0:22:42 - 0:22:50} {META_DATA}: (O)
{0:22:42 - 0:22:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An unusually defective looking TRANSPORTER EFFECT in progress, alternately flashing and glowing -- even the Transporter SOUND seems wrong, as if struggling to overcome some problem.
{0:22:42 - 0:22:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At the console, CHIEF RAND and ASSISTANT are reacting in surprised, near-horror as they attempt vainly to save the situation.
{0:22:42 - 0:22:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RAND
{0:22:42 - 0:22:50} {META_DATA}: (into intercom)
{0:22:42 - 0:22:50} {DIALOGUE}: Starfleet, override us!
{0:22:46 - 0:22:50} {DIALOGUE}: OVERRIDE...!
{0:22:46 - 0:22:53} {DIALOGUE}: Yank them back!
{0:22:46 - 0:22:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, from Rand's console,a VIOLENT GLARE -- a PROTESTING SOUND from the circuitry.
{0:22:46 - 0:22:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And on the con- sole a red-warning light now begins flashing.
{0:22:46 - 0:22:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: STARFLEET VOICE
{0:22:50 - 0:22:53} {DIALOGUE}: Unable to retrieve their pattern, Enterprise....!
{0:22:50 - 0:23:19} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Rand reacts in real horror now as human forms begin to FAINTLY MATERIALIZE, then FADE AWAY, then REAPPEAR IN FAINTLY MISSHAPEN FORM as she frantically works con- trols.
{0:22:50 - 0:23:19} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk ENTERS fast, steps to the console to assist Rand; Scott has also come in and moves to the console, brushes aside the Asst. Chief, and begins manipulating the additional controls himself.
{0:22:50 - 0:23:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTT
{0:23:15 - 0:23:19} {DIALOGUE}: We're losing the pattern...!
{0:23:15 - 0:23:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{0:23:15 - 0:23:19} {META_DATA}: (into intercom)
{0:23:15 - 0:23:19} {DIALOGUE}: Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
{0:23:15 - 0:23:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RAND
{0:23:15 - 0:23:19} {DIALOGUE}: Oh, no!
{0:23:15 - 0:23:19} {DIALOGUE}: They're forming!
{0:23:15 - 0:23:37} {META_DATA}: 77 CLOSER ON THE TRANSPORTER CHAMBER (O)
{0:23:15 - 0:23:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: with the human forms FLUTTERING INTO FULLER AND FULLER MATERIALIZATION, FRIGHTENINGLY, HORRIBLY MISSHAPEN.
{0:23:15 - 0:23:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We RECOGNIZE one form as the Vulcan, Sonak -- the other a human WOMAN.
{0:23:15 - 0:23:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They MATERIALIZE; we HEAR A MOAN form from the Vulcan -- the Woman's SCREAM OF PAIN.
{0:23:15 - 0:23:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, all at once, the half-materialized bodies are gone; the transporter chamber is empty.
{0:23:15 - 0:23:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{0:23:35 - 0:23:37} {DIALOGUE}: Oh, my God...!
{0:23:35 - 0:23:46} {META_DATA}: 78 KIRK, SCOTT AND RAND
{0:23:35 - 0:23:46} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: gazing, horrified, at the empty chamber.
{0:23:35 - 0:23:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{0:23:35 - 0:23:46} {META_DATA}: (into intercom)
{0:23:44 - 0:23:46} {DIALOGUE}: Starfleet, do you have them?
{0:23:44 - 0:23:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A mutter of utter, vacant silence -- and Kirk and Scott look at each other again, their pained faces presaging the answer they already know:
{0:23:44 - 0:23:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: STARFLEET VOICE
{0:23:44 - 0:23:52} {META_DATA}: (shaken)
{0:23:47 - 0:23:52} {DIALOGUE}: Enterprise... what we got back didn't live long.
{0:23:47 - 0:23:59} {DIALOGUE}: Fortunately.
{0:23:47 - 0:23:59} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Another moment of stunned silence, and then Kirk hits the transmission button -- fighting to control his voice as:
{0:23:47 - 0:23:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{0:23:57 - 0:23:59} {DIALOGUE}: Starfleet... Kirk.
{0:24:1 - 0:24:4} {DIALOGUE}: Please... express my condolences to their families.
{0:24:5 - 0:24:8} {DIALOGUE}: Commander Sonak's can be reached through the Vulcan Embassy.
{0:24:5 - 0:24:17} {META_DATA}: (see Rand's stricken expression)
{0:24:14 - 0:24:17} {DIALOGUE}: There was nothing you could have done, Rand.
{0:24:17 - 0:24:20} {DIALOGUE}: It wasn't your fault.
{0:24:17 - 0:24:46} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And before Rand can answer, Kirk leaves the room.
{0:24:17 - 0:24:46} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 79 INT. CORRIDOR - TRAVELING WITH KIRK
{0:24:17 - 0:24:46} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as Kirk steps out, and the doors snap closed behind him.
{0:24:17 - 0:24:46} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In the corridor the furor of the hurried depar- ture is, as everywhere, quite evident: CREW MEMBERS move back and forth.
{0:24:17 - 0:24:46} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But Kirk does not see them; his mind is tormented by the transporter accident -- was there something he should have done, could have done, to prevent it?
{0:24:17 - 0:24:46} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Should he launch on schedule with the starship this unready?
{0:24:17 - 0:24:46} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Has he done right in yielding to this terrible needs for starship command again, forcing Starfleet to give her to him?
{0:24:17 - 0:24:46} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Would Decker's knowledge of the new design have prevented the acci- dent?
{0:24:17 - 0:24:46} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk reaches a corridor intersection, looks around, realizes he's lost track of where he is.
{0:24:17 - 0:24:46} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A passing YEOMAN stops in response to his puzzled expression.
{0:24:17 - 0:24:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{0:24:17 - 0:24:46} {DIALOGUE}: Turboshaft eight...?
{0:24:17 - 0:24:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: YEOMAN
{0:24:44 - 0:24:46} {DIALOGUE}: Back that way, sir.
{0:24:44 - 0:24:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She's indicating back the direction from which Kirk came.
{0:24:44 - 0:24:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He nods his thanks, turns and moves back down the corridor.
{0:24:44 - 0:24:56} {META_DATA}: 80 DECKER
{0:24:44 - 0:24:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: hurrying down the corridor.
{0:24:44 - 0:24:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The two face each other a silent moment, Decker studying Kirk curiously.
{0:24:44 - 0:24:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{0:24:53 - 0:24:56} {DIALOGUE}: We'll have to replace Commander Sonak.
{0:24:57 - 0:24:59} {DIALOGUE}: I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
{0:24:57 - 0:25:1} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{0:24:59 - 0:25:1} {DIALOGUE}: None available, Captain.
{0:25:1 - 0:25:4} {DIALOGUE}: There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
{0:25:1 - 0:25:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{0:25:1 - 0:25:8} {DIALOGUE}: You are, Mister Decker.
{0:25:6 - 0:25:8} {DIALOGUE}: I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer.
{0:25:6 - 0:25:54} {META_DATA}: And Kirk moves on, Decker stands gazing reflectively after him.
{0:25:6 - 0:25:54} {META_DATA}: 81 OMITTED - - 84
{0:25:6 - 0:25:54} {META_DATA}: 85 CLOSE - FULL SHOT OF THE KLINGON SHIP BEING DESTROYED (AS SEEN ON VIEWER) (O)

{0:25:6 - 0:25:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Klingon ship nearly totaled; one engine nacelle gone, smoke and flame spewing from the other, etc.
{0:25:6 - 0:25:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then that final WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT STRIKING AND SPECTACULARLY DESTROYING THE SHIP, etc.)
{0:25:6 - 0:25:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But this time, O.S., we HEAR GASPS of incredulity from many throats (an audience), and various AD LIBBED com- ments: "My God...!"
{0:25:6 - 0:25:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: "I don't believe it...!"
{0:25:6 - 0:25:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: "What could it be...?"
{0:25:6 - 0:25:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Etc., etc.
{0:25:6 - 0:25:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then, immediately following this, on the viewer:

{0:25:6 - 0:25:54} {META_DATA}: (as in earlier Epsilon 9 viewer -- but with no music, only more AD LIBBED exclamations from an audience.)
{0:25:6 - 0:25:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The viewer goes blank.
{0:25:6 - 0:25:54} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 87 INT. RECREATION DECK (M)
{0:25:6 - 0:25:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We SEE that all this was being viewed by the CREW MEMBERS (Aliens included) assembled on the Rec Deck.
{0:25:6 - 0:25:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Recreation Deck is one of the largest areas on the ship, several deck levels high, a part of one wall consisting of picture windows, through which can be seen sections of the drydock structure outside.
{0:25:6 - 0:25:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On another wall is a large viewer, on which was just shown the Klingon transmission.
{0:25:6 - 0:25:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leading off and away from this deck area are what are obviously other specific recreation areas -- gymnasiums, food centers, game rooms, lounges, etc.
{0:25:6 - 0:25:54} {META_DATA}: 88 ANOTHER ANGLE OF THE RED DECK - HIGHER LEVEL
{0:25:6 - 0:25:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as the Crew Members chat in low, grim tones -- Kirk (now with Captain's stripes) appears.
{0:25:6 - 0:25:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he comes into view, the two hundred or so crew below go silent.
{0:25:6 - 0:25:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk grimly indicates the now blank viewer:
{0:25:6 - 0:25:54} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{0:25:6 - 0:25:54} {DIALOGUE}: That's all we know about it; except that it's now 2.2 days from Earth.

{0:25:51 - 0:26:7} {META_DATA}: 89 ANOTHER ANGLE - CREW REACTIONS
{0:25:51 - 0:26:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as the CAMERA FINDS various faces: human, alien; most young, all intelligent, forthright -- anxious.
{0:25:51 - 0:26:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk has paused a moment, now continues.
{0:25:51 - 0:26:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK (O.S.)
{0:25:51 - 0:26:7} {DIALOGUE}: We assume there is a vessel of some type at the heart of the cloud.
{0:26:4 - 0:26:7} {DIALOGUE}: Our orders are to intercept, investigate; and take whatever action is necessary... and possible.
{0:26:4 - 0:26:27} {META_DATA}: (beat)
{0:26:4 - 0:26:27} {DIALOGUE}: ...We can only hope that the life form aboard that vessel reasons as we do.

{0:26:28 - 0:26:29} {DIALOGUE}: Put it on the viewer here...!

{0:41:17 - 0:41:19} {DIALOGUE}: Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines.
{0:41:24 - 0:41:26} {DIALOGUE}: When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
{0:41:24 - 0:41:32} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk is surprised by this information, perhaps slight- ly chagrined.
{0:41:24 - 0:41:32} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After a beat:

{0:43:28 - 0:43:39} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{0:43:35 - 0:43:39} {DIALOGUE}: It's an obsession -- that can blind you so far more immediate -- and critical responsibilities.
{0:43:39 - 0:43:43} {DIALOGUE}: Your reaction to Decker is an example.
{0:43:39 - 0:43:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk studies him a beat; has McCoy touched a nerve?

{0:46:53 - 0:47:10} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But as Chapel crosses to Spock, her pleased smile brightening her whole face, Spock turns, dismisses her presence with a cold disinterested glance -- Chapel stops, stands dumbfounded.
{0:46:53 - 0:47:10} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock gives McCoy a similar glance - turns back to his console readings as:
{0:46:53 - 0:47:10} {CHARACTER_NAME}: UHURA
{0:47:8 - 0:47:10} {DIALOGUE}: That's how we all feel, Mister...

{0:47:8 - 0:47:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock has turned back again for a last quick reading at the console and now stands -- totally ignoring everyone else as he speaks coolly, unemotionally to Kirk:

{0:47:12 - 0:47:14} {DIALOGUE}: With your permission, I will now discuss these fuel equations with the Engineer.

{0:47:12 - 0:47:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock heads for the elevator -- puz- zled expressions from the entire bridge crew.
{0:47:12 - 0:47:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then Kirk calls after him, very sincerely:

{0:47:21 - 0:47:49} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk glances, perplexed, at McCoy.

{0:48:1 - 0:49:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In the lounge, empty but for them, are Kirk and McCoy -- obviously awaiting Spock, who ENTERS and presents himself cold and aloof as before:
{0:48:1 - 0:49:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK

{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, he complies but sits formally, rigidly.

{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {DIALOGUE}: You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions.
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {DIALOGUE}: A group of minds from a space vessel?

{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {META_DATA}: (still formally)
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {DIALOGUE}: Negative, Captain.
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {DIALOGUE}: I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic.
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {DIALOGUE}: I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk is clearly disappointed -- and a bit uncomfortable about what he must ask next.
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He exchanges a glance with McCoy, then:
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {DIALOGUE}: Also -- there was nothing in your report about why you're here.
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {DIALOGUE}: That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {DIALOGUE}: Spock, we've already guessed why you're here...
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {DIALOGUE}: I inquired about you -- learned you were studying with the Masters...
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Although Spock has been almost infuriatingly emotionless, his expression shifts slightly.
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: McCoy indicates this:
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {DIALOGUE}: That flicker of emotion confirms our guess.
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {DIALOGUE}: You failed.

{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {DIALOGUE}: And now, anger, Spock?

{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {DIALOGUE}: ... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {DIALOGUE}: If you achieve perfect logic, Spock, you'll pay a price.
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {DIALOGUE}: It's given your planet ten thousand years of peace, but no poetry's been written since then, no music.
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock has come to his feet fast - but Kirk is on his feet too, confronting him.

{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {DIALOGUE}: Thank you.
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock EXITS.
{0:49:2 - 0:51:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk and McCoy exchange a troubled look, then EXIT too as CAMERA CENTERS AGAIN ON OBSERVATION WINDOW, the view of space there.

{0:58:15 - 1:0:28} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as the CLOUD OBSCURES all now.
{0:58:15 - 1:0:28} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everyone gazes at the viewer, almost mesmerized by the shifting violet power- field displays.
{0:58:15 - 1:0:28} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{0:58:15 - 1:0:28} {META_DATA}: (staring at viewer, frustrated, awed)

{1:0:34 - 1:0:36} {DIALOGUE}: Instruments fluctuating, Captain.

{1:0:38 - 1:2:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: (V'GER THEME MUSIC UP) The Cloud "Aurora" EFFECT rapidly thinning -- in the "eye of the hurricane" center of the Cloud is the object which has stunned the entire bridge crew.
{1:0:38 - 1:2:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Rapidly growing in size -- already frighteningly huge.
{1:0:38 - 1:2:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Totally alien in look.
{1:0:38 - 1:2:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Its enormous bulk is irrides- cent, faintly glowing, suggesting that it is made up of exotic combinations of matter, and energy far beyond the scientific knowledge or ability of Earth's 23rd Century technology.
{1:0:38 - 1:2:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Menacing and yet strangely beautiful, both at the same time.

{1:0:38 - 1:2:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Seeing the object on the viewer (O.S. at this ANGLE), Chekov's eyes open with wide astonishment.
{1:0:38 - 1:2:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He crosses quickly to his weapons--defense station, his eyes on the viewer.
{1:0:38 - 1:2:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: McCoy, eyes also fixed on the sight, moves to Kirk's side.

{1:0:38 - 1:2:23} {META_DATA}: (This will be the first time we've seen Spock dislay- ing a definite reaction, almost an emotion.)
{1:0:38 - 1:2:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: So engrossed is Spock in the main viewer IMAGE that he appears not to have heard Kirk, whose AD LIBS a sharp "Mr. Spock...!"
{1:0:38 - 1:2:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock looks absently at Kirk an instant, then:
{1:0:38 - 1:2:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:0:38 - 1:2:23} {META_DATA}: (awed; compelled)
{1:0:38 - 1:2:23} {DIALOGUE}: That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.

{1:2:39 - 1:2:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CAMERA TRAVELING WITH ENTERPRISE as it moves on a parallel--closing course -- Alien continues to GROW IN SIZE.
{1:2:39 - 1:2:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Although it already seems an impossibly large vessel compared to the Enterprise, in reality they are still tens of thousands of kilometers apart; the incredible size of the Alien is nowhere near being realized yet.
{1:2:39 - 1:2:52} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 204A INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING VIEWER
{1:2:39 - 1:2:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Tension high as -- the Alien now appears so close that its IMAGE MORE THAN FILLS VIEWER.
{1:2:39 - 1:2:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Considerable tension of bridge -- crew members, throwing nervous looks from viewer to Kirk.
{1:2:39 - 1:2:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: How much closer?!

{1:3:12 - 1:3:14} {DIALOGUE}: Adjust parallel course, Navigator.
{1:3:12 - 1:8:4} {DIALOGUE}: Bring us in to one hundred kilometers distance.
{1:3:12 - 1:8:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Very nervous looks now directed toward Kirk.
{1:3:12 - 1:8:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Even Spock gives him a glance, a raised eyebrow.
{1:3:12 - 1:8:4} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 205 EXT. SPACE - CAMERA TRAVELING WITH ENTERPRISE
{1:3:12 - 1:8:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Alien Object appears A DOZEN TIMES LARGER THAN ENTERRISE and still GROWING IN SIZE.
{1:3:12 - 1:8:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We begin to SEE Alien exterior detailing which had not even been suspected at a longer distance.
{1:3:12 - 1:8:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Enterprise is now quartering in toward the Intruder, coming closer and closer.
{1:3:12 - 1:8:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Alien vessel is still GROWING IN SIZE -- more and more, its exterior appears to be made of substances never before seen by a human eye -- substances considered possible only in the wildest flights of scientific theory -- plasma-matter, energy fields diamond--hard in their power, solid sheets of subatomic particles, crystalline-lace patterns which seem capable of shifting their nature and rearranging themselves.
{1:3:12 - 1:8:4} {META_DATA}: 205A ANGLE ON INTRUDER
{1:3:12 - 1:8:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This time, the Enterprise travels on away from us, as its course takes it angling nearer and nearer the gigantic Alien Intruder -- the Starship dwindling in size, growing smaller, smaller, smaller... until it is a tiny dot compared to the enormity of the Alien vessel.
{1:3:12 - 1:8:4} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 206 INT. BRIDGE - VIEWER (O)
{1:3:12 - 1:8:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We are coming alongside the mid-section of the Alien vessel, now so huge that only a small section of it now completely fills main viewer frame.
{1:3:12 - 1:8:4} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SULU
{1:3:12 - 1:8:4} {DIALOGUE}: One hundred kilometers...
{1:3:12 - 1:8:4} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:8:2 - 1:8:4} {DIALOGUE}: Hold relative position here...
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk's voice is blotted out by a DEAFENING, SHRILL- ING SOUND, accompanied by a multi-hued point of LIGHT which EXPLODES into BLINDING INTENSITY, obscuring everything for an instant.
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Overlapping this action, we HEAR:
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {CHARACTER_NAME}: COMPUTER'S VOICE
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {DIALOGUE}: Intruder alert...!
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {DIALOGUE}: Intruder alert!

{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {META_DATA}: 208 THE PLASMA ENERGY PROBE (O)
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The BLINDING LIGHT FADES and in its lace we SEE a strange "entity" shocking us with its frightening appearance and its ugly-sounding THROBBING HUM of power.
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is about seven feet tall and resembles a "blob" of raw energy in shifting patterns and colors of deep, ugly hues of upper spectrum violet.
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Yet, it looks strangely alive.
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At the end of the "tendril"
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {META_DATA}: (of light) is an "eye" (a small multi-colored device)
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {META_DATA}: 209 CREW REACTIONS -- ELEVATORS IN B.G. (O)
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The bridge crew reacting hard, shocked and shaken -- the THROBBING SOUND of the Alien thing intensifies as it begins to move across the bridge.
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, in b.g., an elevator door snaps oen and two SECURITY MEN burst onto the bridge, phasers drawn.
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chekov shouts warningly at the Men:
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CHEKOV
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {DIALOGUE}: No weapons...!
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But Chekov is too late: First Security Man FIRES -- the BLAST harmlessly absorbed by the Probe which emits a SCREECHING nerve-grating SOUND --- sends out a SMALL WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT which instantly envelopes First Security Man in a PURPLE GLOW (of implosion).
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Second Security Man has almost lifted his phaser -- but now carefully, slowly is moving his hand away from his weapon.
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {META_DATA}: 210 CLOSER - THE SECURITY MEN (O)
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: PURPLE GLOW FADES, the First Security Man has simply vanished.
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {META_DATA}: 210A FULL SHOT - BRIDGE
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chekov, like the others, horrified, flips a switch and the COMPUTER-VOICE ("Intruder Alert") goes OFF.
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At the same time Chekov speaks into his intercom:
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CHEKOV
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {DIALOGUE}: Security... do not send further teams!
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Probe is sending out snake-like tendrils to the various consoles on the bridge.
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: These tendrils lash out in a cobra-strike movement, the tendril-head seeming to enter into the console affected -- at which time all monitors and instrument lights there come ON as if the Probe is "reading" each console function.
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crew carefully stays clear of the tendrils.
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock has risen, moving to Kirk's side as he slowly brings his tricorder up, very carefully extracting its tiny sensor and aiming it at the probe.
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CHEKOV
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {META_DATA}: (shaken)
{1:8:2 - 1:8:47} {DIALOGUE}: No intruder readings on other decks, Captain...

{1:8:48 - 1:8:53} {META_DATA}: (to Kirk)
{1:8:50 - 1:8:53} {DIALOGUE}: A plasma-energy combination...
{1:8:50 - 1:8:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Meanwhile, the probe is now hovering near Chekov who sits frozen, fists clenched, jaw tight.
{1:8:50 - 1:8:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:8:55 - 1:8:56} {DIALOGUE}: Don't interfere with it...!
{1:8:55 - 1:8:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CHEKOV
{1:8:56 - 1:8:59} {DIALOGUE}: Absolutely, I will not interfere!
{1:8:56 - 1:9:3} {META_DATA}: 210B ANGLE INCLUDING SPOCK'S CONSOLE (O)
{1:8:56 - 1:9:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as the "probe" withdraws an energy-tendril from one bridge station and "inserts" it into another console.
{1:8:56 - 1:9:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:9:1 - 1:9:3} {DIALOGUE}: No one interfere...!
{1:9:4 - 1:9:7} {DIALOGUE}: It doesn't seem interested in us -- only the ship...!
{1:9:4 - 1:9:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk's words are never completed as suddenly all the energy tendrils withdraw from all consoles and a larger, more powerful-looking tendril lashes out, snaking into the science console complex.
{1:9:4 - 1:9:25} {META_DATA}: 210C CLOSER ON SCIENCE CONSOLE
{1:9:4 - 1:9:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Where, also immediately, all the console and computer lights are suddenly flashing wildly, rapidly --
{1:9:4 - 1:9:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -- There is an incredibly fast EXCHANGE OF HIGH-PITCHED BEES -- the computer obviously in unauthorized commu- nication with the probe!
{1:9:4 - 1:9:25} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:9:23 - 1:9:25} {DIALOGUE}: Computer off!
{1:9:23 - 1:9:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:9:23 - 1:9:43} {DIALOGUE}: It's taken control of the computer...!
{1:9:23 - 1:9:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:9:23 - 1:9:43} {DIALOGUE}: It's running our records!
{1:9:40 - 1:9:43} {DIALOGUE}: Starfleet strength, Earth defenses...
{1:9:40 - 1:10:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Decker moves to the main power control, Spock now steps in, his Vulcan strength easily brushing Kirk and Decker aside.
{1:9:40 - 1:10:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock clasps his fists above his head, brings it down in a SHATTERING BLOW on the console.
{1:9:40 - 1:10:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It splits open!
{1:9:40 - 1:10:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the bridge lights dim even more, and as the science console shorts itself out -- and off, Decker confronts Spock:
{1:9:40 - 1:10:48} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:9:40 - 1:10:48} {DIALOGUE}: We could have cut it off at the main computer...
{1:9:40 - 1:10:48} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:9:40 - 1:10:48} {DIALOGUE}: This served the purpose.
{1:9:40 - 1:10:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk has been giving Spock a puzzled look -- Spock now turns abruptly, and:
{1:9:40 - 1:10:48} {META_DATA}: 210D ANOTHER ANGLE (O)
{1:9:40 - 1:10:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as Spock, in stepping back, accidentally brushes the probe's energy tendril -- a FLASH OF LIGHT at the contact point sends Spock sinning under the rail and to the floor near Ilia.
{1:9:40 - 1:10:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The probe's energy-tendril has withdrawn from the darkened science console, hov- ers high over the dazed Spock as if angrily seeking the reason for the break in its computer contact.
{1:9:40 - 1:10:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock starts to rise.
{1:9:40 - 1:10:48} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ILIA
{1:9:40 - 1:10:48} {DIALOGUE}: Mr. Spock, don't move...!
{1:9:40 - 1:10:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Decker steps toward her, AD LIBBING a grim "Ilia...!"
{1:9:40 - 1:10:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But he has no chance as:

{1:9:40 - 1:10:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Probe hovers over her, its whole mass seemingly about to envelope her with a single tendril extended toward her, somehow freezing her into immobility - and then the entire Probe DISSOLVES IN A BLINDING FLASH OF WHITE, obscuring Ilia.
{1:9:40 - 1:10:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Almost instantly the WHITE FLASH FADES -- but Ilia has vanished -- her tricorder clattering to the deck.

{1:11:47 - 1:13:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Meanwhile, Decker has begun an Executive Officer's bridge circuit, assisting with various con- soles.
{1:11:47 - 1:13:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk is glancing toward Spock who continues concentrating on the Viewer, striving to comprehend the myriad of thoughts he is sensing from he Aliens.

{1:11:47 - 1:13:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And it is frighteningly obvious that the tractor beam is pulling the Enterprise to the opening.

{1:11:47 - 1:13:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: showing the unusual "iris" now almost fully open as Enterprise is drawn closer, closer -- through the "iris" we now SEE (some of) V'ger's interior: a dark void relieved only by strange flickering glows of dis- tant ENERGY FIELD PATTERNS.

{1:11:47 - 1:13:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:13:7 - 1:13:9} {DIALOGUE}: Captain, suggest a maximum phaser strike directly at the beam might weaken it just enough for us to break free --

{1:13:7 - 1:13:11} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK

{1:13:15 - 1:14:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk staring at the viewer -- the "iris" now fully open so that the exterior of V'ger is no longer visible -- and all we can SEE is the monstrous void dead ahead, which is looming faster and larger before our eyes.

{1:13:15 - 1:14:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now we can SEE that the dark void is actually a vast chamber, dimly and intermittently lit by POWERFIELDS appearing and vanishing along the vessel's inner walls, which are miles away in the distance.
{1:13:15 - 1:14:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And here and there in the chamber gigantic ENERGY DISPLAYS erupt briefly with a certain symmetry that suggests they must be part of V'ger's ower or control systems.

{1:18:48 - 1:18:51} {DIALOGUE}: Join with the Creator... ?
{1:18:48 - 1:18:51} {DIALOGUE}: How?
{1:18:48 - 1:18:54} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:18:51 - 1:18:54} {DIALOGUE}: V'ger and the Creator will become One.
{1:18:51 - 1:18:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:18:54 - 1:18:55} {DIALOGUE}: Who is the Creator?
{1:18:54 - 1:18:58} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{1:18:54 - 1:18:58} {META_DATA}: (worried)
{1:18:54 - 1:18:58} {DIALOGUE}: Mr. Spock, be careful.
{1:18:54 - 1:18:58} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:18:55 - 1:18:58} {DIALOGUE}: The Creator is that which created V'ger.
{1:18:55 - 1:19:0} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:18:58 - 1:19:0} {DIALOGUE}: Who is V'ger?
{1:18:58 - 1:19:2} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:19:0 - 1:19:2} {DIALOGUE}: V'ger is that which seeks the Creator.
{1:19:0 - 1:19:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Another moment of total exasperation, frustration, during which "Ilia" seems to be waiting politely, patiently for any further questions.
{1:19:0 - 1:19:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When none are forthcoming:
{1:19:0 - 1:19:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:19:0 - 1:19:9} {META_DATA}: (continuing; pleasant, bland)
{1:19:6 - 1:19:9} {DIALOGUE}: I am ready to commence my observations.
{1:19:6 - 1:19:14} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:19:6 - 1:19:14} {META_DATA}: (fast; to McCoy)
{1:19:12 - 1:19:14} {DIALOGUE}: Doctor, a thorough examination of this probe might provide some insight into those who manufactured it, and how to deal with them.
{1:19:12 - 1:19:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{1:19:17 - 1:19:19} {DIALOGUE}: Let's get her to sickbay.
{1:19:17 - 1:19:28} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And he grasps "Ilia's" arm to escort her.
{1:19:17 - 1:19:28} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But is as though he has seized cast iron: immovable.
{1:19:17 - 1:19:28} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: McCoy is thrown off balance merely by 'Ilia's" remaining sta- tionary.
{1:19:17 - 1:19:28} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She ignores McCoy, addresses Kirk:
{1:19:17 - 1:19:28} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:19:26 - 1:19:28} {DIALOGUE}: I am programmed to observe and record normal functioning procedures of the carbon-based units.
{1:19:26 - 1:19:33} {META_DATA}: 256B Kirk glances at McCoy, who is totally bemused, but then
{1:19:26 - 1:19:33} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk quickly responds to "Ilia":
{1:19:26 - 1:19:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:19:30 - 1:19:33} {DIALOGUE}: The examination is a normal function.
{1:19:30 - 1:19:57} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:19:30 - 1:19:57} {META_DATA}: (a beat)
{1:19:30 - 1:19:57} {DIALOGUE}: You may proceede.
{1:19:30 - 1:19:57} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{1:19:30 - 1:19:57} {META_DATA}: (carefully)
{1:19:30 - 1:19:57} {DIALOGUE}: Thank you.

{1:19:30 - 1:19:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: scanning a "body".
{1:19:30 - 1:19:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: PULL BACK TO SHOW McCoy, Chapel, Kirk, Spock and Chekov -- standing over "ILIA" who lies prone on the table, the physicians moving the scanner over her.
{1:19:30 - 1:19:57} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{1:19:30 - 1:19:57} {META_DATA}: (from the start; indicating)
{1:19:53 - 1:19:57} {DIALOGUE}: ... micro-miniature hydraulics, sensors, molecule-sized multi- processor chips... and look at this...
{1:19:53 - 1:20:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In the b.g., Decker enters, grimly observes the proceed- ings.
{1:19:53 - 1:20:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CHAPEL
{1:19:53 - 1:20:5} {META_DATA}: (impressed)
{1:20:3 - 1:20:5} {DIALOGUE}: An osmotic micro-pump... here and here.
{1:20:6 - 1:20:9} {DIALOGUE}: Even the smallest body functions are exactly duplicated.
{1:20:6 - 1:20:15} {META_DATA}: (traces with finger on screen)
{1:20:12 - 1:20:15} {DIALOGUE}: And every exocrine system is here, too --
{1:20:12 - 1:20:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chapel breaks off abruptly, noticing "Ilia" is peering intently -- almost with a glimmer of recognition -- at Decker.
{1:20:12 - 1:20:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Slightly disconcerted, Chapel continues:
{1:20:12 - 1:20:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CHAPEL
{1:20:12 - 1:20:18} {META_DATA}: (continuing)
{1:20:16 - 1:20:18} {DIALOGUE}: -- even eye moisture.

{1:20:16 - 1:20:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as everyone reacts to "Ilia's" utterance of Decker's name.
{1:20:16 - 1:20:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It seems to make the deepest impression on Spock, confirming something he has suspected.
{1:20:16 - 1:20:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:20:16 - 1:20:24} {META_DATA}: (to "Ilia")
{1:20:16 - 1:20:24} {DIALOGUE}: Interesting.
{1:20:22 - 1:20:24} {DIALOGUE}: Not 'Decker-unit'?
{1:20:22 - 1:20:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: "Ilia" continues peering at Decker with just a hint of a puzzled frown, a glimmer of distant recognition.
{1:20:22 - 1:20:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's the first time we've seen her expression look anything but cool and bland.
{1:20:22 - 1:20:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This results in the quizzical rising of one of Spock's eyebrows.
{1:20:22 - 1:20:47} {META_DATA}: 258 ANOTHER ANGLE
{1:20:22 - 1:20:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: McCoy's examination now turns "Ilia" away from the others.
{1:20:22 - 1:20:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock quickly catches Kirk's and Decker's attention, indicates an adjoining door -- they fol- low him out of the room.
{1:20:22 - 1:20:47} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 259 INT. McCOY'S OFFICE
{1:20:22 - 1:20:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as Kirk, Spock and Decker enter, the door snapping shut -- and Spock touching the electronic lock to secure them.
{1:20:22 - 1:20:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He faces the others:
{1:20:22 - 1:20:47} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:20:45 - 1:20:47} {DIALOGUE}: Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
{1:20:45 - 1:20:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:20:45 - 1:20:50} {DIALOGUE}: It's a programmed mechanism, Mr. Spock...
{1:20:45 - 1:20:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:20:45 - 1:20:50} {DIALOGUE}: We have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in precise detail.
{1:20:45 - 1:20:50} {DIALOGUE}: Suppose that beneath its programming, the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.
{1:20:45 - 1:20:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:20:45 - 1:20:50} {DIALOGUE}: They had a pattern to follow...
{1:20:45 - 1:20:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:20:45 - 1:20:50} {META_DATA}: (nods)
{1:20:45 - 1:20:50} {DIALOGUE}: ... they may have followed it too precisely.
{1:20:45 - 1:20:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:20:45 - 1:20:50} {META_DATA}: (comprehending)
{1:20:45 - 1:20:50} {DIALOGUE}: Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.
{1:20:45 - 1:20:50} {META_DATA}: 259A ANGLE ON DECKER
{1:20:45 - 1:20:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: also comprehending, and not liking it one bit as Spock and Kirk are both turning their attention to him.
{1:20:45 - 1:20:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:20:47 - 1:20:50} {DIALOGUE}: Exactly.
{1:20:47 - 1:21:18} {META_DATA}: (to Decker)
{1:21:14 - 1:21:18} {DIALOGUE}: And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
{1:21:14 - 1:21:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:21:14 - 1:21:29} {DIALOGUE}: That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that killed Ilia!
{1:21:14 - 1:21:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:21:27 - 1:21:29} {DIALOGUE}: Commander, we're locked in an alien vessel, six hours from Earth orbit, our only contact with our captors is the probe.
{1:21:29 - 1:21:31} {DIALOGUE}: If we can control it, persuade it, use it in some way...
{1:21:29 - 1:21:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Interrupted by the SOUND of someone trying to open the locked door behind them.
{1:21:29 - 1:21:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then a METAL RIPPING SOUND as they whirl to see:
{1:21:29 - 1:21:37} {META_DATA}: 260 MEDICAL OFFICE DOOR
{1:21:29 - 1:21:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: with the METAL BUCKLING, TEARING -- and a single hand slicing the steel door like paper.
{1:21:29 - 1:21:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is the "Ilia" probe, her face absolutely impassive, her whole manner incongruously benign.
{1:21:29 - 1:21:37} {META_DATA}: (Behind her, a startled McCoy, Chapel and Chekov.)
{1:21:29 - 1:21:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: "Ilia" speaks flatly, blandly.
{1:21:29 - 1:21:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:21:35 - 1:21:37} {DIALOGUE}: I have recorded enough here.
{1:21:35 - 1:21:39} {META_DATA}: (motions to Kirk)
{1:21:37 - 1:21:39} {DIALOGUE}: You will now assist me further.
{1:21:37 - 1:21:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk exchanges a quick glance with Spock.
{1:21:37 - 1:21:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then:
{1:21:37 - 1:21:47} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:21:37 - 1:21:47} {META_DATA}: (indicating Decker)
{1:21:44 - 1:21:47} {DIALOGUE}: The Decker-unit can assist you with much greater efficiency...
{1:21:44 - 1:21:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: "Ilia" has seemed about to object -- but now her eyes hold on Decker.
{1:21:44 - 1:21:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then she nods.
{1:21:44 - 1:21:54} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:21:44 - 1:21:54} {META_DATA}: (continuing)
{1:21:51 - 1:21:54} {DIALOGUE}: Carry on with your assignment, Mr. Decker.
{1:21:51 - 1:21:56} {META_DATA}: 260A ANOTHER ANGLE - ACROSS DECKER TO THE SMASHED DOOR (AND "ILIA")
{1:21:51 - 1:21:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as Decker looks at "Ilia" who stands at the torn door.
{1:21:51 - 1:21:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: You can read Decker's mind: I'm supposed to persuade that?!
{1:21:51 - 1:21:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns back, finds Kirk's eyes on him.
{1:21:51 - 1:21:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Decker nods.
{1:21:51 - 1:21:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:21:55 - 1:21:56} {DIALOGUE}: Aye, sir.
{1:21:55 - 1:22:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: "Ilia" and a reluctant Decker EXIT.
{1:21:55 - 1:22:5} {META_DATA}: 260B EMPHASIZING SPOCK
{1:21:55 - 1:22:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: looking very troubled as they watch Decker and "Ilia" leave.
{1:21:55 - 1:22:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk notices.
{1:21:55 - 1:22:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:21:55 - 1:22:5} {DIALOGUE}: Spock?
{1:21:55 - 1:22:5} {DIALOGUE}: Concerned about his chances?
{1:21:55 - 1:22:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:22:1 - 1:22:5} {DIALOGUE}: I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.
{1:22:1 - 1:22:12} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock EXITS.
{1:22:1 - 1:22:12} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 261 INT. V'GER - THE ENTERPRISE
{1:22:1 - 1:22:12} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: floating in the vast, eerie, alien chamber -- sporadic FLASHES OF ENERGY, erupting now and then.
{1:22:1 - 1:22:12} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Various other EFFECTS.
{1:22:1 - 1:22:12} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: OVER this, Kirk's VOICE:
{1:22:1 - 1:22:12} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK (V.O.)
{1:22:1 - 1:22:12} {DIALOGUE}: Captain's Log.
{1:22:9 - 1:22:12} {DIALOGUE}: Stardate 7414.1.
{1:22:12 - 1:22:16} {DIALOGUE}: Our best estimates place us some four hours from Earth.
{1:22:18 - 1:22:22} {DIALOGUE}: No significant Ilia memory patterns within the alien probe.
{1:22:22 - 1:22:26} {DIALOGUE}: This remains our only means of contact with our captor.
{1:22:22 - 1:22:28} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 262 INT. ENTERPRISE AIRLOCK AREA
{1:22:22 - 1:22:28} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The area dimly lit -- unoccupied but for a lone AIRLOCK TECHNICIAN checking and adjusting instruments.
{1:22:22 - 1:22:28} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The CAMERA MOVES PAST him to FIND:
{1:22:22 - 1:22:28} {META_DATA}: 263 SPOCK
{1:22:22 - 1:22:28} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His face fixed with grim determination, walking quietly with obvious intent not to attract the Tech's attention.
{1:22:22 - 1:22:28} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now he steals up behind the TECH -- and in an instant has applied a Vulcan nerve pinch.
{1:22:22 - 1:22:28} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Tech slumps over his console.
{1:22:22 - 1:22:28} {META_DATA}: 264 INT KIRK'S CABIN - VIEWER MONITOR
{1:22:22 - 1:22:28} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Showing a CLOSE SHOT of ENTERPRISE PICTURES, then PULL BACK SLIGHTLY for an IMAGE of Decker and "Ilia" walk- ing through the Rec Deck.
{1:22:22 - 1:22:28} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: PULL BACK FURTHER TO SHOW Kirk watching this -- and with him is McCoy.
{1:22:22 - 1:22:28} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They continue watching a troubled beat, as:
{1:22:22 - 1:22:28} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:22:22 - 1:22:28} {META_DATA}: (of pictures)
{1:22:26 - 1:22:28} {DIALOGUE}: All these vessels were called "Enterprise".
{1:22:26 - 1:22:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: "Ilia" is giving the pictures a very interested look as we HEAR in Kirk's cabin:

{1:22:26 - 1:22:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK'S INTERCOM VOICE
{1:22:26 - 1:22:43} {DIALOGUE}: Kirk here.
{1:22:26 - 1:22:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In the b.g., Spock's station a MAINTENANCE TEAM is replacing the broken Science Station computer.
{1:22:26 - 1:22:43} {META_DATA}: (Spock is conspicuously absent.)
{1:22:26 - 1:22:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: UHURA
{1:22:26 - 1:22:43} {DIALOGUE}: A faint signal from Starfleet, sir.
{1:22:26 - 1:22:43} {DIALOGUE}: They have the intruder on their monitors...
{1:22:26 - 1:22:43} {META_DATA}: (struggling to hear)
{1:22:26 - 1:22:43} {DIALOGUE}: They show us... three hours... twenty-four minutes from Earth!

{1:22:26 - 1:22:43} {META_DATA}: (thru intercom)
{1:22:26 - 1:22:43} {DIALOGUE}: Thank you.
{1:22:26 - 1:22:43} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 267 INT. RECREATION DECK
{1:22:26 - 1:22:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Decker and "Ilia", the Rec Deck unoccupied but for a pair of wary SECURITY GUARDS at a very discreet dis- tance.
{1:22:26 - 1:22:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are near the pictures of the five Enter- prises, which should be FEATURED in this SHOT, as Decker waves his hand about the huge room.
{1:22:26 - 1:22:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:22:39 - 1:22:43} {DIALOGUE}: The carbon units use this area for recreation...
{1:22:39 - 1:22:53} {META_DATA}: (carefully)
{1:22:49 - 1:22:53} {DIALOGUE}: What type of recreation does the crew aboard your vessel enjoy...?
{1:22:49 - 1:22:56} {META_DATA}: 268 CLOSER TWO SHOT (PICTURES O.S.)
{1:22:49 - 1:22:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As "Ilia" moves on into the room, Decker follows:
{1:22:49 - 1:22:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:22:54 - 1:22:56} {DIALOGUE}: The words 'recreation' and 'enjoy' have no meaning to my programming.
{1:22:54 - 1:23:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Decker peers at the lovely android with frustration -- and no little pain, for she is after all the exact replica of Ilia.
{1:22:54 - 1:23:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She pays not the slightest attention to Decker's reaction, and begins walking about the Rec Deck taking in (and, clearly, transmitting all images to V'ger) the sights.
{1:22:54 - 1:23:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are near a game area (elec- tronic games), and now Decker points to one game, switches it on -- presses button to activate its LIGHTS and SOUNDS.
{1:22:54 - 1:23:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: "Ilia" watches interestedly as Decker operates the game.
{1:22:54 - 1:23:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:23:13 - 1:23:15} {DIALOGUE}: Ilia 'enjoyed' this game... she nearly always won --
{1:23:13 - 1:23:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And he demonstrates again, as "Ilia" steps to the device, deftly hits some buttons -- and for just an instant she turns to Decker with a momentary glimmer of recognition.
{1:23:13 - 1:23:24} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 269 INT. KIRK'S CABIN - GROUP WATCHING THE MONITOR
{1:23:13 - 1:23:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: McCoy watching with special interest:
{1:23:13 - 1:23:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{1:23:13 - 1:23:24} {META_DATA}: (approving)
{1:23:21 - 1:23:24} {DIALOGUE}: Good!
{1:23:21 - 1:23:24} {DIALOGUE}: He's using audial-visual association.
{1:23:21 - 1:24:1} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But the words are not out of McCoy's mouth when "Ilia" says:
{1:23:21 - 1:24:1} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:23:59 - 1:24:1} {DIALOGUE}: This device serves no purpose.
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She steps away from the game; Decker's disappointment is evident.
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: So is everyone elses.
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {DIALOGUE}: Damn...!
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {META_DATA}: (nods grimly)
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {DIALOGUE}: She needs something else: something much more personal to stimulate memory patterns.
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {DIALOGUE}: Something with a more emotional tie.
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk reacts to this, reflective.
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 270 INT. REC DECK FULL ON DECKER AND "ILIA"
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Decker waving back toward the general area of the Enterprise pictures.
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {DIALOGUE}: The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units.
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {DIALOGUE}: In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {DIALOGUE}: Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {META_DATA}: (hoping he's struck a responsive chord)
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {DIALOGUE}: Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {META_DATA}: (controlling surprise)
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {DIALOGUE}: What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
{1:23:59 - 1:24:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:24:12 - 1:24:16} {DIALOGUE}: Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
{1:24:12 - 1:24:19} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And with this she moves off, observing other Rec Deck objects.
{1:24:12 - 1:24:19} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Decker moves with her; then:

{1:24:12 - 1:24:19} {META_DATA}: (carefully)
{1:24:16 - 1:24:19} {DIALOGUE}: Enterprise would be unable to function without carbon units.
{1:24:16 - 1:24:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:24:20 - 1:24:23} {DIALOGUE}: More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.

{1:24:20 - 1:24:33} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as he reacts to this ominous note; he stops abruptly.

{1:24:33 - 1:24:36} {DIALOGUE}: When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
{1:24:33 - 1:24:45} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This has been delivered with chilling blandness, and she stands facing Decker, almost as though waiting for him to thank her.
{1:24:33 - 1:24:45} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He thinks fast now.
{1:24:33 - 1:24:45} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:24:42 - 1:24:45} {DIALOGUE}: Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit.
{1:24:48 - 1:24:50} {DIALOGUE}: If I can help you revive these patterns; you could understand our functions better.
{1:24:48 - 1:24:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:24:51 - 1:24:53} {DIALOGUE}: That is logical.
{1:24:51 - 1:27:14} {DIALOGUE}: You may procede.

{1:24:51 - 1:27:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Up through the hatch a circular airlock door opens -- and a tiny figure in a thruster spacesuit emerges, steps into space, slowly floats down through the hatch and under the Enterprise saucer section.
{1:24:51 - 1:27:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In this and subsequent VIEWS we will SEE that on the rear pack of his thruster spacesuit is a FLASHING STROBE LIGHT which regularly EMITS the identifying SIGNAL of this particular suit.
{1:24:51 - 1:27:14} {META_DATA}: (By which Kirk will be able to see Spock's position even from several miles away.)

{1:24:51 - 1:27:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MOVING TOWARD the CAMERA until the features behind the face mask are clearly identifiable: Spock, his face set in the same grim, determined expression, as he touches his spacesuit transmitter control.

{1:28:39 - 1:31:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A cloud of CRYSTAL FORMS (Kirk's entrapment) become visible to one side but Spock passes them at some dis- tance and does not attract them.
{1:28:39 - 1:31:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We can SEE more clearly now the point on the inner wall of the trough toward which Spock is heading.
{1:28:39 - 1:31:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is an unusual combination of GLOWING FORCEFIELDS which seem to mark this point of the vessel as of some importance.
{1:28:39 - 1:31:18} {META_DATA}: (Here, also, we will become aware of "sensor-bee" swarms, intermittently darting toward this same wall from all points of the chamber.)

{1:28:39 - 1:31:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:28:39 - 1:31:18} {DIALOGUE}: Then he'll have still led me to it, won't he?
{1:28:39 - 1:31:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And Kirk steps into the airlock door, hits a control -- it begins sliding closed behind him.

{1:28:39 - 1:31:18} {META_DATA}: (reacting; tight)
{1:28:39 - 1:31:18} {DIALOGUE}: ... when we met.
{1:28:39 - 1:31:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clearly this is very painful to Decker.

{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: On Delta... remember...?
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And it seems that "Ilia" does remember.
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She peers at her image, then sets the headband into its exact proper position.
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then she turns and looks at them with recognition.

{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Decker is completely overwhelmed, struggles for words and looks to McCoy for some kind of help.
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: McCoy realizes Decker is losing himself in fantasy.
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: (gently reminding)
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: Commander... this is a mechanism...
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Decker is startled, and for another slit-second he's lost -- but then he realizes the reality, and what he should do:
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: (gently; but urgingly)
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: Ilia, help us make direct contact with V'ger...

{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: cannot.
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Decker looks at "Ilia's" hand still resting on his.
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then:
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: Then tell us who V'ger is; where he's from... W need your help.
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For another moment "Ilia" continues smiling at Decker, holding his hand.
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, abruptly, the smile vanishes -- the hand is released.
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clearly, she's again the probe, as:
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: Why have two carbon units entered V'ger...?
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Decker glances at McCoy, who shakes his head almost imperceptibly: he doesn't know.
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But Decker has an obvious reply:
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: They want to make contact with V'ger... (trying to revive "Ilia's" memory again; touches her hand) Ilia...
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: "Ilia" peers at him blankly, allows him to continue touching her hand, but obviously it means nothing to her.
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: (continuing; distressed, to "Ilia") Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: Their purpose is to survive.
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: That is also V'ger's purpose.
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Decker's face reflects his bemusement:
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: That is how V'ger will survive.
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: 286 ON DECKER
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as now, the bemusement changes to just the slightest enlightenment.
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: I wish to continue my observations.

{1:31:17 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk tries to avoid them; he hits a second MANEUVERING JET -- but he overcompensates, and spins straight into the intercepting swarm of them.

{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: 296 ON SPOCK - CLOSE
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as Kirk's VOICE STOPS -- and all that is heard now is the HEAVY STATIC crackling ominously.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock's expression flickers, then he hits reverse thruster JETS, stops -- he turns to glance at the inner wall, then his thrusters turn him so he can look back the way he came from.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But he cannot resist Kirk's call; he suddenly hits his thruster controls, then JETS FLARE, and:
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: 297 WIDER ANGLE - SPOCK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as thruster JETS accelerate him back toward Kirk.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 298 INT. BRIDGE - VIEWER (M)
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: showing Kirk's spacesuit completely covered, encased in the blob.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk is no longer moving.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But in the distance, facing toward him is Spock!
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 299 INT. V'GER - KIRK AND SPOCK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: with Spock in the near distance, heading TOWARD the CAMERA.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he approaches Kirk, Spock brings out his phaser.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now he hits the controls for the REVERSE JETS -- he slows RAPIDLY as he approaches Kirk's now complete- ly encased spacesuit.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock makes a quick phaser adjustment.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: 300 ANGLE ON SPOCK AND KIRK'S ENCASED SPACESUIT (O) (S)
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock levels the phaser carefully.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: FIRES.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The PHASER BEAM strikes the blob form -- it SHATTERS, the pieces DISINTEGRATING.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 301 INT. V'GER - SPOCK AND KIRK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: facing each other while hovering in space.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: Bridge, cancel rescue teams.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: (hard)
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: I am seeking answers, Captain.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: (with insight)
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: Answers to what, Spock?
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: Our dilemma -- or your personal one?
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock does not immediately reply, peers at Kirk through the faceplate a long beat, then abruptly looks away, points off into the distance:
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: 302 ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING INNER WALL (O)
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We can SEE what appear to be SPARKLING GLOBULES OF LIGHT darting toward the inner wall in the distance, then disappearing there.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: (We'll SEE other swarms occasionally too, coming from different directions -- they will later be identified as "sensor swarms" on closer examination.)
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: (pointing)
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: Captain, I believe there we will find an indication of whoever -- or whatever -- is aboard this vessel...
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk weighs alternatives, then pushes his thruster controls and begins moving in the direction Spock indicated.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Their thruster jets flash, propel them toward the point on the inner wall.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 303 INT. V'GER - AT INNER WALL
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The most prominent area of the vast inner wall -- the patterns on the wall here seem to GLOW with life.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The spacesuited figures of Kirk and Spock ENTER SCENE, gliding slowly toward what seems to be the central part of theses patterns.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: 304 CLOSER ON KIRK AND SPOCK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as they approach and then we SEE the brief REVERSE THRUSTERS and then forward momentum stops; motionless.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then Spock sees something, indicates.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: 305 LONG ANGLE TO INCLUDE SENSOR SWARM (O)
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now, we SEE that they are tiny, multi-colored points of FLASHING LIGHT -- almost like swarms of bees.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They approach the inner wall at this central point and seem to "disappear" through the orifice.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: 306 KIRK AND SPOCK - ANOTHER "SWARM" APPROACHING (O)
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This "sensor swarm" has been coming from a direction that will take them close past Kirk and Spock.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, as it passes, Spock reaches out quickly, grabs.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns to Kirk, his hand closed on something.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: 307 CLOSE ON KIRK AND SPOCK (AGAINST "TUBE" WALL)
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock opens his hand, retaining a hold on something with his fingers.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He brings it up to Kirk's face mask -- it's a tiny SENSOR, its multi-colors flashing as it tries to escape from Spock's fingers.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And in this CLOSE VIEW, we SEE that this is a SENSOR very much like the one we've seen earlier embedded in the Ilia-probe's throat hollow.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then Spock releases it and it darts to join the sensor swarm near the opening of the inner wall.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: 308 KIRK AND SPOCK'S POV (O)
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: From this closer distance, we SEE that an opening ap- pears in the wall, admits the sensor swarm, then closes immediately.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: 309 BACK TO SHOT
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk and Spock exchange a look.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Their thruster JETS ignite briefly, moving them in that direction.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 310 INT. V'GER - KIRK AND SPOCK (O)
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: closely approaching the inner wall now, timing their movements to coincide with the arrival of another "swarm" -- the wall begins OPENING.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The "swarm" through, the wall begins CLOSING -- but Spock and Kirk slip in before it closes.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 311 INT. "MEMORY CAVE" - SPOCK AND KIRK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The wall closing behind them, they are safely inside.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But as they stop their forward momentum, their eyes widen with awe and surprise at what they are seeing:
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: 311A WHAT THEY SEE (M)
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The long "cave" chamber with its row of huge MEDIATOR BALLS extending into the distance.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: To one side, the gleaming CRYSTAL MEMORY WALL.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: 311B KIRK AND SPOCK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as Spock makes a quick analysis and estimate of what they are seeing.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, he takes out his tricorder again, propels himself toward the memory crystals.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk follows.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: 311C AT MEMORY CRYSTAL
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as Spock adjusts his tricorder through several readings.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: A remarkably efficient system.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: (indicates)
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: (nods; indicates)
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: New crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained --
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And Spock touches one of these new crystals (it will be shinier, more pulsating than the others): ANOTHER
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: RAPID
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: PROFUSION OF FAINT IMAGES, but this time including a pattern-like image of Klingons, Klingon vessels (the ones destroyed by the Cloud), and obvious Starfleet personnel -- and the Epsilon 9 station.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Also, a
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: pattern
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: of the Security Guard killed by the probe.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And Ilia.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!!
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: They seem to be more than just images...
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: (agreeing)
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: Exact patterns.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: But why?
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And he turns and begins moving on, studying the wall, consulting his tricorder.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: 312 ACROSS THEM TO ANOTHER SECTION OF THE WALL
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock inspecting this area at which the "newer" crystals are PULSATING and GLOWING, and which appears to be a termination of the Crystal area, continuing on and dis- appearing through the wall.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew?
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: Or is their entire ship automated?
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: Captain, I do not believe there is a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat, as Kirk reacts incredulously.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: (continuing)
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: I am almost certain now that all of this is V'ger -- I believe that we are inside a life form, a living machine.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock turns his spacesuit, turns his tricorder out to- ward the Mediator Balls, takes a reading in that di- rection.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then a glance to Kirk.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: I must attempt mindmeld with it, Captain.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock touches his spacesuit controls; the THRUSTER JETS move him out toward the Mediator Balls.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: (warningly)
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: Spock...
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: 313 ANGLE AT MEDIATOR BALL
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock reaching the Ball, halts his momentum and removes one gauntlet, baring his hand.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Stretching the bare hand toward a part of it which looks strangely "alive."
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The very power generated from this area is clearly affecting Spock's hand.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Meanwhile, Kirk has used his THRUSTERS to join him.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: Spock, if you're right, its mind may be enormous...
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But Spock pays him no attention, his entire being now focused on the PULSATING GLOW of the "alive" area -- the CAMERA MOVING IN CLOSER TO Spock, as he forces his hand toward that surface, closer, closer.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: 314 KIRK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: watching, almost mesmerized.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Torn between wanting to pull Spock away from the wall -- and knowing that Spock must go through with it.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For everyone's sake.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: 315 CLOSER ON SPOCK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: preparing for the ordeal, moving his hand to the "liv- ing area," the invisible force even stronger -- but Spock's strength unwavering, and now he touches the surface -- and it FLARES WITH STRANGE ENERGY at the touch.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And at the same moment Spock' body convulses as if tens of thousands of volts of electricity are charging through him.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: 316 CLOSE ON SPOCK'S FACE
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as he begins to shudder with the shock, the CAMERA CONTINUES INTO EXTREME CLOSE-UP as we SEE Spock's mouth open -- he SCREAMS.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CAMERA INTO EXTREME CLOSE SHOT OF SPOCK'S EYES.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: 317 CAMERA ZOOM - THROUGH SPOCK'S EYES
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MUSIC IN AND UP as we travel through ABSTRACT IMAGES (per Con Pederson discussion).
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Symbolizing V'ger's incredible and complex store of mechanistic knowledge, these IMAGES suggest patterns of atoms, molecules, galaxies, dimensions of the universe beyond human knowledge or comprehension.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It takes only fifteen or twenty seconds, but seems to span aeons, taking us through micro-infinity and macro-infinity.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: DISSOLVE TO :
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 318 INT. DISPENSARY - SPOCK'S EYES
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CAMERA BRIDGING BACK OUT THROUGH SPOCK'S EYES AND INTO ANGLE ON SPOCK'S FACE as he lies in a sickbay bed.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His eyes are open; he is staring straight ahead as if in a catatonic state, completly unaware of his surroundings.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then Doctor Chapel leans INTO SCENE, moving a medical scanner over the brain area.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CHAPEL
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: Now scanning pons area at spinal nerve fiber connection...
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: 319 ANGLE ON McCOY AND KIRK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: McCoy at a console, watching readings he is getting from Chapel's scanner.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk watches McCoy anxiously.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: Indications of some neurological trauma--the power pouring through that mind-meld must have been staggering...
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Before Kirk can reply, they HEAR a LAUGH!
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An abrupt, harsh, bitter laugh.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: 320 ACROSS THEM TO SICKBAY
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as all whirl to the patient area where it is obviously Spock who has just laughed -- but there is no indication of laughter from him now.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A startled Chapel has stepped back away from the bed.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock seems to be attempting to focus, orient himself as Kirk and McCoy hurry to the bedside.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: (quiet)
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: Jim...
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And Spock reaches out a hand weakly., takes a surprised Kirk's hand in his.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: McCoy exchanges a surprised glance with Kirk, as Spock -- clutching Kirk's hand in friend- ship and need -- struggles to summon strength to speak.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: (continuing)
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: This simple feeling...
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: (looks at Kirk)
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: ... is so far beyond V'ger's comprehension.
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: 321 ANOTHER ANGLE
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: with Kirk and McCoy exchanging another surprised glance (at Spock's emotion), with McCoy gesturing Kirk not to question it.

{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {META_DATA}: (gently)
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: Were you right?
{1:33:7 - 1:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: Spock?
{1:33:7 - 1:33:22} {DIALOGUE}: V'ger is a living machine...?
{1:33:7 - 1:33:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:33:7 - 1:33:22} {META_DATA}: (nodding)
{1:33:19 - 1:33:22} {DIALOGUE}: A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.

{1:33:25 - 1:33:30} {META_DATA}: (to Chapel)
{1:33:25 - 1:33:30} {DIALOGUE}: We're living machines, too: protein mechanisms.
{1:33:25 - 1:33:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk nods at McCoy.
{1:33:25 - 1:33:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:33:28 - 1:33:30} {DIALOGUE}: And it considers the Enterprise a living machine: that's why the probe refers to our ship as an entity.
{1:33:28 - 1:33:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CHAPEL
{1:33:28 - 1:33:37} {DIALOGUE}: If it thinks our ship is alive what does it think we are?
{1:33:28 - 1:33:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{1:33:28 - 1:33:37} {META_DATA}: (dryly)
{1:33:28 - 1:33:37} {DIALOGUE}: An 'infestation' -- bacteria... microbes.
{1:33:28 - 1:33:37} {META_DATA}: 322 ANOTHER ANGLE

{1:33:28 - 1:33:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:33:34 - 1:33:37} {DIALOGUE}: I saw V'ger's planet: a planet populated by living machines.
{1:33:37 - 1:33:39} {DIALOGUE}: Unbelievable technology.
{1:33:37 - 1:33:45} {META_DATA}: (pained)
{1:33:41 - 1:33:45} {DIALOGUE}: V'ger has knowledge that spans this universe.
{1:33:41 - 1:34:5} {DIALOGUE}: And... in all this order... all this magnificence, V'ger feels no awe...no delight... no beauty...
{1:33:41 - 1:34:5} {META_DATA}: (a beat; exhausted)
{1:34:3 - 1:34:5} {DIALOGUE}: I should have known...
{1:34:3 - 1:34:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk waits for Spock to continue, but Spock seems too weak.
{1:34:3 - 1:34:11} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:34:3 - 1:34:11} {DIALOGUE}: Know what, Spock?
{1:34:9 - 1:34:11} {DIALOGUE}: What?
{1:34:9 - 1:34:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But Spock falls back, exhausted -- and McCoy gently tugs at Kirk, AD-LIBBING, "Let him rest, Jim..." Kirk shrugs McCoy away, addresses Spock:

{1:34:48 - 1:34:51} {DIALOGUE}: No meaning... No hope...
{1:34:48 - 1:34:57} {META_DATA}: (summoning strength)
{1:34:55 - 1:34:57} {DIALOGUE}: And, Jim, no answers...!
{1:34:55 - 1:34:57} {DIALOGUE}: Jim, it's looking for answers itself!
{1:34:55 - 1:34:57} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:34:55 - 1:34:57} {DIALOGUE}: What answers?
{1:34:55 - 1:35:6} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:35:4 - 1:35:6} {DIALOGUE}: 'Is this all I am?
{1:35:7 - 1:35:8} {DIALOGUE}: Is there not more?'
{1:35:7 - 1:35:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just then an INTERCOM SIGNAL:
{1:35:7 - 1:35:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: UHURA'S VOICE
{1:35:20 - 1:35:23} {DIALOGUE}: A faint signal from Starfleet, sir!
{1:35:23 - 1:35:26} {DIALOGUE}: Intruder Cloud has been located on their outer monitors for past twenty-seven minutes... dissipating rapidly as it approaches.

{1:35:43 - 1:35:45} {DIALOGUE}: I need Spock on the bridge.
{1:35:43 - 1:35:50} {META_DATA}: 323 ANOTHER ANGLE
{1:35:43 - 1:35:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as Chapel urns to a MED TECH, AD LIBS an order, "Dalaphaline, twenty cc's..." As the Tech quickly sets the hypo-injector, and hands it to Chapel - and she injects Spock, the hypo emitting a fast, QUIET HISS -- Kirk gazes at Spock just an instant as Spock breathes deeply, the drug clearly strengthening him.
{1:35:43 - 1:35:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chapel and the Tech help Spock from the bed, as Kirk addresses McCoy:
{1:35:43 - 1:35:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:35:48 - 1:35:50} {DIALOGUE}: A machine planet...?
{1:35:51 - 1:35:53} {DIALOGUE}: Sending a machine to Earth looking for its Creator...?
{1:35:51 - 1:36:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{1:35:51 - 1:36:9} {DIALOGUE}: God.
{1:35:51 - 1:36:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk looks at him, then at Spock -- on his feet now -- then at McCoy again:
{1:35:51 - 1:36:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:35:51 - 1:36:9} {DIALOGUE}: 'To find the Creator,' the probe said.
{1:35:51 - 1:36:9} {DIALOGUE}: Find God...?
{1:35:51 - 1:36:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{1:35:51 - 1:36:9} {DIALOGUE}: Isn't that what we're all trying to do...?
{1:35:51 - 1:36:9} {META_DATA}: (dryly)
{1:35:51 - 1:36:9} {DIALOGUE}: All us machines...?
{1:35:51 - 1:36:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk stands facing him another moment, then whirls and steps to the monitor, flips some buttons, and peaks into his communicator.
{1:35:51 - 1:36:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:36:6 - 1:36:9} {DIALOGUE}: Mr. Chekov, Commander Decker's present location?

{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: I want to make a ship's announcement.
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: But it's to be heard only in Engineering.
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: UHURA'S VOICE
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: Ready, Captain.
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {META_DATA}: (voice amplified)
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: This is the Captain speaking.
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: It appears that the alien ship... V'ger... is NOT a manned vessel...
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {META_DATA}: 324 ENGINEERING
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SHOWING Scott (at his console) listening to Kirk's words -- and facing Decker and "Ilia" who are just about to leave Engineering.
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {META_DATA}: (In b.g. the Engine core GLOWS the appropriate color, and there is a SOFT HUM of IDLE POWER.)
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk's VOICE continues:
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK'S VOICE
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {META_DATA}: (amplified)
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: It is a living entity...!

{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: We are attempting to ascertain its intentions.
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: All personnel will maintain yellow alert status!
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {META_DATA}: 325 CLOSER ON DECKER AND "ILIA"
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The probe bland as usual, but Kirk's words seem to have strangely elated Decker; he says to her:
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: A machine...!
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: Then it had to be programmed.
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: By whom...?
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: By the Creator.

{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet.
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: That is the programming.
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {META_DATA}: 326 INCLUDE SCOTT
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: just now confronting them, regarding "Ilia" with open disapproval.
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTT
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: Well, sir, now what about all that?
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: A living entity, the Captain says... entity... A living thing...!
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Decker really hasn't heard Scott; he's gazing at "Ilia," attempting to digest what she's just said.
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But quickly:
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: Thank you, Scotty...
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He moves to leave.
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTT
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {META_DATA}: (dourly)
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: Your welcome, sir.
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now Decker and "Ilia" move toward the exit, Scott gaz- ing after them glaringly, watching "Ilia's" every move.
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, almost into the corridor, "Ilia" turns and looks back at the engine room.
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She addresses Decker, but load enough for Scott to overhear:
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: There is no logical reason for carbon units to control Enterprise's power systems.
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTT
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {META_DATA}: (to "Ilia")
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: Lassie, if I were functioning 'logically,' right now I'd be showing you the inside of our scrap metal compactor!
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 327 INT. BRIDGE
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk with McCoy and Spock, who although somewhat shaky, is clearly more alert.
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are just assuming their stations.
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: UHURA
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: We're now locked into Starfleet's transceivers; Admiral Nogura has received your reports, sir.
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {META_DATA}: 328 ANGLE INCLUDING VIEWER (O)
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk pausing halfway to his chair to study the viewer on which is appearing an IMAGE of V'ger looming omi- nously in orbit over Earth.
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: UHURA
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: The visual is a lunar monitor relay, sir.
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As they begin to study it, the IMAGE suddenly distorts and is replaced by signal interference -- SIGNAL STATIC LINES RUNNING ACROSS THE VIEWER SCREEN.
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {META_DATA}: (Somewhat resembling the kind of high voltage interference some-times seen on the television screen.)
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: UHURA
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {META_DATA}: (continuing)
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: Heavy interference, sir -- it's coming from here, inside the intruder itself...
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Uhura hits buttons and immediately from the speakers we HEAR A SERIES OF CARRIER WAVE BEEPS.
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock looks up from his console, listens to it.
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:36:6 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: Puzzling!
{1:37:0 - 1:37:3} {DIALOGUE}: The interference appears to be a rather simple carrier wave code signal...
{1:37:0 - 1:37:25} {CHARACTER_NAME}: UHURA
{1:37:0 - 1:37:25} {DIALOGUE}: On an old style radio frequency, sir...
{1:37:0 - 1:37:25} {META_DATA}: 329 PAST KIRK TO THE ELEVATOR
{1:37:0 - 1:37:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as the doors snap open and Decker and "Ilia" appear.
{1:37:0 - 1:37:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All eyes go to them as:
{1:37:0 - 1:37:25} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:37:0 - 1:37:25} {META_DATA}: (to Decker; interrupting)
{1:37:0 - 1:37:25} {DIALOGUE}: As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
{1:37:0 - 1:37:25} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:37:0 - 1:37:25} {META_DATA}: (nods; turns to Kirk)
{1:37:0 - 1:37:25} {DIALOGUE}: V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
{1:37:0 - 1:37:25} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:37:0 - 1:37:25} {DIALOGUE}: 'To learn all that is learnable.'
{1:37:0 - 1:37:25} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:37:0 - 1:37:25} {META_DATA}: (to Kirk)
{1:37:0 - 1:37:25} {DIALOGUE}: It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
{1:37:0 - 1:37:25} {CHARACTER_NAME}: UHURA
{1:37:0 - 1:37:25} {META_DATA}: (whirling)
{1:37:0 - 1:37:25} {DIALOGUE}: Sir!
{1:37:0 - 1:37:25} {DIALOGUE}: V'ger's signals have stopped...
{1:37:0 - 1:37:25} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:37:0 - 1:37:25} {META_DATA}: (as if frightened)
{1:37:23 - 1:37:25} {DIALOGUE}: Decker... The Creator has not responded.
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk hears this, turning inquiringly toward her, but Uhura interrupts:
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: UHURA
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {DIALOGUE}: Picking up Starfleet again; a lunar monitor relay...
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {META_DATA}: 330 ANGLE INCLUDING VIEWER (O)
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as, indeed, the interference is fading and a new Main Viewer IMAGE is appearing -- it shows V'GER IN EARTH ORBIT with a strange looking OBJECT moving away from V'ger.
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is an ominous looking, HUGE SWIRLING GREEN MASS -- it resembles the same green plasma-energy bolts that destroyed the Klingons and Epsilon 9 -- and very nearly the Enterprise.
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is not a bolt now -- the mass is much larger and appears much more deadly.
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A second object has now formed and moves off, a third one begins to appear.
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {META_DATA}: (Meanwhile, the first and second PLASMA- ENERGY OBJECTS are moving off into the distance in different direction.)
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {DIALOGUE}: My God!
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {DIALOGUE}: They're the same kind of things that destroyed the Klingons, Epsilon Nine...
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {META_DATA}: (interrupting; from science console)
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {DIALOGUE}: These read as identical composition...
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {META_DATA}: (turns to Kirk)
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {DIALOGUE}: ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {DIALOGUE}: High mag, Mr. Sulu!
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sulu adjusts the viewer through several IMAGE MAGNI- FICATIONS until we SEE the huge OMINOUS GREEN DEVICES more clearly.
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SULU
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {DIALOGUE}: The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming...
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: UHURA
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {META_DATA}: (overlapping)
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {DIALOGUE}: Urgent signal from Starfleet, Captain!
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {META_DATA}: (turns, shaken)
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {DIALOGUE}: All Earth defense systems have gone dead.
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk reacts hard at this.
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Uhura gets another message.
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: UHURA
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {META_DATA}: (continuing)
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {DIALOGUE}: Sir, Starfleet computes their trajectories as moving toward equidistant positions over Earth.
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {META_DATA}: 331 ANOTHER ANGLE - KIRK AND SPOCK
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: exchanging significant glances.
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {DIALOGUE}: From four equidistant positions, Captain, a detonation would blanket the entire surface of the planet.
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DIFALCO
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {DIALOGUE}: I plot them as reaching equidistant positions in... twenty-nine minutes, sir... mark!
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {META_DATA}: 332 ACROSS KIRK TO DECKER AND "ILIA"
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as Kirk vaults from his chair, strides to a handrail to confront the "Ilia"-probe.
{1:37:23 - 1:38:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:38:49 - 1:38:50} {DIALOGUE}: Why...?!
{1:38:49 - 1:38:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:38:49 - 1:38:50} {DIALOGUE}: The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
{1:38:49 - 1:38:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:38:49 - 1:38:50} {DIALOGUE}: Why?!
{1:38:49 - 1:38:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:38:50 - 1:38:52} {DIALOGUE}: The Creator has not answered.
{1:38:50 - 1:39:0} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:38:50 - 1:39:0} {DIALOGUE}: The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
{1:38:50 - 1:39:0} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:38:57 - 1:39:0} {DIALOGUE}: You infest and control Enterprise.
{1:39:0 - 1:39:3} {DIALOGUE}: V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner.
{1:39:0 - 1:39:13} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:39:0 - 1:39:13} {META_DATA}: (to Kirk)
{1:39:0 - 1:39:13} {DIALOGUE}: Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a machine too.
{1:39:0 - 1:39:13} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:39:0 - 1:39:13} {META_DATA}: (nods)
{1:39:0 - 1:39:13} {DIALOGUE}: It seems we all imagine God in our own image.
{1:39:0 - 1:39:13} {META_DATA}: 333 ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWER - INCLUDING CHEKOV (O)
{1:39:0 - 1:39:13} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Three of the four OMINOUS SWIRLING GREEN OBJECTS have all moved away from V'ger now, in different directions, growing smaller in the distance.
{1:39:0 - 1:39:13} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The fourth object is holding position nearby, seeming to grow in size and intensity.
{1:39:0 - 1:39:13} {META_DATA}: 334 ANGLE EMPHASIZING KIRK
{1:39:0 - 1:39:13} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as he throws a look toward Spock who is now in deep meditation.
{1:39:0 - 1:39:13} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk turns and takes "Ilia's" shoulders and carefully turns her to face him.
{1:39:0 - 1:39:13} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{1:39:0 - 1:39:13} {DIALOGUE}: '... similar life forms...?'
{1:39:0 - 1:39:13} {DIALOGUE}: Jim, V'ger's saying the Creator is a machine...!
{1:39:0 - 1:39:13} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:39:0 - 1:39:13} {META_DATA}: (grimly amused)
{1:39:0 - 1:39:13} {DIALOGUE}: Of course: we all create God in our own image.
{1:39:0 - 1:39:13} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk peers at Decker a moment, ingesting this thought.
{1:39:0 - 1:39:13} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he addresses "Ilia" again, this time with emotion: after all, he is pleading for the survival of the entire planet:
{1:39:0 - 1:39:13} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:39:12 - 1:39:13} {DIALOGUE}: V'ger!
{1:39:12 - 1:39:24} {DIALOGUE}: If we are lesser beings, we are still, like you, living.
{1:39:12 - 1:39:24} {DIALOGUE}: And because we are alive, we -- like you -- wish to survive.
{1:39:12 - 1:39:24} {DIALOGUE}: You must not destroy --
{1:39:12 - 1:39:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk pauses abruptly: "Ilia" is regarding him blandly, stonily -- not the slightest reaction or response; clearly Kirk's plea is being ignored.
{1:39:12 - 1:39:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk draws in his breath to continue, realizes the futility, turns helplessly to Spock.
{1:39:12 - 1:39:24} {META_DATA}: 335 ACROSS KIRK TO SPOCK
{1:39:12 - 1:39:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: who has been listening intently, with near fascination -- an idea forming in his mind.
{1:39:12 - 1:39:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Quickly, he steps down to Kirk:
{1:39:12 - 1:39:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:39:12 - 1:39:24} {META_DATA}: (quiet, terse)
{1:39:23 - 1:39:24} {DIALOGUE}: Captain...

{1:39:23 - 1:39:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:39:34 - 1:39:36} {DIALOGUE}: Child...!?
{1:39:34 - 1:39:41} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:39:38 - 1:39:41} {DIALOGUE}: Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.
{1:39:38 - 1:39:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:39:38 - 1:39:46} {META_DATA}: (intrigued)
{1:39:44 - 1:39:46} {DIALOGUE}: Needing what...?
{1:39:44 - 1:39:54} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{1:39:44 - 1:39:54} {DIALOGUE}: Spock, this 'child' is about to eliminate all life on Earth; how do we teach it that that's 'wrong'?
{1:39:51 - 1:39:54} {DIALOGUE}: With a spanking...!?
{1:39:51 - 1:40:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock peers at McCoy almost sadly, then replies to Decker.
{1:39:51 - 1:40:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:39:51 - 1:40:5} {DIALOGUE}: It doesn't know what it needs, Comm ander...
{1:39:51 - 1:40:5} {META_DATA}: (to Kirk)
{1:40:3 - 1:40:5} {DIALOGUE}: It does not know.
{1:40:3 - 1:40:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk says nothing, looks at Spock who is awaiting a reaction; then Kirk glances at "Ilia" -- his brain is racing, struggling to reach a decision.
{1:40:3 - 1:40:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then:
{1:40:3 - 1:40:21} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:40:3 - 1:40:21} {META_DATA}: (abruptly to "Ilia")
{1:40:18 - 1:40:21} {DIALOGUE}: The carbon--units-know-why-the Creator-has-not-responded.

{1:40:18 - 1:40:26} {DIALOGUE}: Ilia... we can help V'ger find what it needs --
{1:40:18 - 1:40:26} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: "Ilia" studies Decker just a bland beat, then turns to Kirk:
{1:40:18 - 1:40:26} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:40:18 - 1:40:26} {META_DATA}: (to Kirk, hard)
{1:40:24 - 1:40:26} {DIALOGUE}: Disclose the information.
{1:40:24 - 1:40:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:40:24 - 1:40:30} {META_DATA}: (cool, calm)

{1:40:26 - 1:40:42} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:40:38 - 1:40:42} {DIALOGUE}: KIRK UNIT!
{1:40:38 - 1:40:52} {DIALOGUE}: DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION!
{1:40:38 - 1:40:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk studies her a moment, then decides to press his bet:
{1:40:38 - 1:40:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:40:38 - 1:40:52} {META_DATA}: (to "Ilia," almost pleasant)
{1:40:38 - 1:40:52} {DIALOGUE}: No.
{1:40:38 - 1:40:52} {META_DATA}: (then to crew commandingly)
{1:40:51 - 1:40:52} {DIALOGUE}: Secure all stations.
{1:40:52 - 1:40:54} {DIALOGUE}: Clear the bridge.
{1:40:52 - 1:40:59} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A moment where all are startled at this order -- but no time for questions as just then the ship is ROCKED BY A FURIOUS POWERFUL ERUPTION NEARBY within V'ger.
{1:40:52 - 1:40:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:40:52 - 1:40:59} {META_DATA}: (amplified)
{1:40:52 - 1:40:59} {DIALOGUE}: Bridge to all decks,secure your stations.
{1:40:52 - 1:40:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY

{1:40:52 - 1:40:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SULU
{1:40:56 - 1:40:59} {DIALOGUE}: Clear the bridge, Captain...?
{1:40:56 - 1:41:1} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:40:59 - 1:41:1} {DIALOGUE}: That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
{1:40:59 - 1:41:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just then another ERUPTION -- the ship is ROCKED AGAIN.
{1:40:59 - 1:41:16} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 337 INT. INSIDE V'GER - THE ENTERPRISE
{1:40:59 - 1:41:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: rocked about by the furious powerfields -- with frightening displays of ray energy.
{1:40:59 - 1:41:16} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 338 INT. BRIDGE
{1:40:59 - 1:41:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as all react to the powerful blasts, holding on to railings, etc, at the same time attempting to secure their stations for the evacuation.
{1:40:59 - 1:41:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The DAMAGE REPAIR TECHNICIAN leaves his station, crossing to exit.
{1:40:59 - 1:41:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DAMAGE TECH.
{1:40:59 - 1:41:16} {META_DATA}: (leaving bridge; to Captain)
{1:40:59 - 1:41:16} {DIALOGUE}: Severe stress on engine pylons, sir.
{1:40:59 - 1:41:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:40:59 - 1:41:16} {META_DATA}: (to Kirk; flat)
{1:41:14 - 1:41:16} {DIALOGUE}: V'ger requires the information.
{1:41:14 - 1:41:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk merely looks at her, then to the evacuating crew:
{1:41:14 - 1:41:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:41:19 - 1:41:22} {DIALOGUE}: Bridge secure all stations!
{1:41:19 - 1:41:22} {DIALOGUE}: Move out!
{1:41:19 - 1:41:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{1:41:22 - 1:41:24} {DIALOGUE}: Jim, what the hell kind of strategy is this...?
{1:41:22 - 1:41:28} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Meanwhile, Decker has crossed to Chekov's now abandoned console, checks it.
{1:41:22 - 1:41:28} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:41:26 - 1:41:28} {DIALOGUE}: All ship's functions going to automatic, Captain.
{1:41:26 - 1:41:32} {META_DATA}: 339 ANGLE ON KIRK
{1:41:26 - 1:41:32} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: turning to confront "Ilia":
{1:41:26 - 1:41:32} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:41:30 - 1:41:32} {DIALOGUE}: If V'ger destroys the Enterprise, the information V'ger requires will also be destroyed.
{1:41:30 - 1:41:35} {META_DATA}: 339A INCLUDING VIEWER
{1:41:30 - 1:41:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as LIGHT SHOW outside perceptically recedes, and simul- taneously the ROCKING CEASES.
{1:41:30 - 1:41:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At the same time, "Ilia" is saying:
{1:41:30 - 1:41:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:41:32 - 1:41:35} {DIALOGUE}: It is illogical to withhold required information.
{1:41:32 - 1:41:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk does not reply to this, turns away to observe the withdrawing crew.
{1:41:32 - 1:41:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Most are out; only Spock, Decker and McCoy remain behind -- with McCoy on his way.
{1:41:32 - 1:41:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The bridge lighting dims, and now Kirk looks at Spock, who nods approvingly; clearly Spock is the only person who seems to comprehend what Kirk is doing, and why.
{1:41:32 - 1:41:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Kirk now moves toward the exit, and the lights are dimmed even further:
{1:41:32 - 1:41:44} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:41:32 - 1:41:44} {META_DATA}: (almost polite)
{1:41:42 - 1:41:44} {DIALOGUE}: Kirk-unit, why do you not disclose information?
{1:41:42 - 1:41:51} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:41:48 - 1:41:51} {DIALOGUE}: Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
{1:41:48 - 1:41:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:41:51 - 1:41:53} {DIALOGUE}: They have repressed the Creator.
{1:41:51 - 1:41:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:41:53 - 1:41:56} {DIALOGUE}: The information will not be disclosed.
{1:41:53 - 1:41:59} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And, gesturing the others ahead of him, Kirk starts toward the bridge elevator.
{1:41:53 - 1:41:59} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: "Ilia" calls after him:
{1:41:53 - 1:41:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:41:53 - 1:41:59} {META_DATA}: (almost a plea)
{1:41:57 - 1:41:59} {DIALOGUE}: V'ger needs the information.
{1:41:57 - 1:42:4} {META_DATA}: 340 AT THE ELEVATORS
{1:41:57 - 1:42:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Decker and McCoy about to enter, Spock and Kirk just behind -- all stopping abruptly now at "Ilia's" state- ment.
{1:41:57 - 1:42:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The very tone of her voice is enough for them to realize they have made a very telling point.
{1:41:57 - 1:42:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk follows fast:
{1:41:57 - 1:42:4} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:41:59 - 1:42:4} {DIALOGUE}: Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
{1:41:59 - 1:42:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: "ILIA"
{1:42:6 - 1:42:9} {DIALOGUE}: V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
{1:42:6 - 1:42:17} {META_DATA}: 341 ANGLE ON McCOY
{1:42:6 - 1:42:17} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: wryly reacting to this:
{1:42:6 - 1:42:17} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{1:42:16 - 1:42:17} {DIALOGUE}: It learns fast, doesn't it...?
{1:42:16 - 1:42:25} {META_DATA}: 342 ACROSS McCOY TO KIRK AND SPOCK
{1:42:16 - 1:42:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as Kirk looks at Spock, Kirk's whole expression convey- ing the obvious question: "What the hell do we do now?"
{1:42:16 - 1:42:25} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But Spock is ready with an answer:
{1:42:16 - 1:42:25} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:42:21 - 1:42:25} {DIALOGUE}: Captain, the vessel -- V'ger -- obviously operates from a central brain complex...
{1:42:21 - 1:42:27} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock allows the sentence to hang, as he and Kirk eye each other significantly, the CAMERA SWINGING OVER TO KIRK so we can perceive that to Kirk this idea has an even greater significance.
{1:42:21 - 1:42:27} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:42:21 - 1:42:27} {META_DATA}: (to Spock)
{1:42:25 - 1:42:27} {DIALOGUE}: The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?
{1:42:25 - 1:42:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:42:27 - 1:42:29} {DIALOGUE}: Precisely.
{1:42:27 - 1:42:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk nods grimly, faces "Ilia" again; this time he's playing for all the stakes.
{1:42:27 - 1:42:42} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:42:38 - 1:42:42} {DIALOGUE}: The carbon units' information cannot be disclosed to V'ger's probe... only to V'ger directly.
{1:42:38 - 1:43:9} {META_DATA}: 343 ANOTHER ANGLE - REACTIONS
{1:42:38 - 1:43:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: all wait with hushed expectancy, all eyes on "Ilia" who seems momentarily in some internal communication.
{1:42:38 - 1:43:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She turns away from Kirk and steps forward looking at the Main Viewer.
{1:42:38 - 1:43:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{1:42:38 - 1:43:9} {META_DATA}: (indicating viewer)
{1:42:38 - 1:43:9} {DIALOGUE}: Jim...!
{1:42:38 - 1:43:9} {META_DATA}: 344 PAST THEM TO VIEWER
{1:42:38 - 1:43:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: the image of the chamber in which the Enterprise is imprisoned.
{1:42:38 - 1:43:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But now, toward the chamber-end, where further passage had previously been barred by the lace- work energy barriers -- an OPENING APPEARS.
{1:42:38 - 1:43:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And at the same time there is a GENTLE LURCHING EFFECT, and:
{1:42:38 - 1:43:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:43:8 - 1:43:9} {DIALOGUE}: Forward motion, Captain...!
{1:43:8 - 1:43:10} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:43:9 - 1:43:10} {DIALOGUE}: A tractor beam...
{1:43:9 - 1:43:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: "Ilia" steps down from the platform and into the well where she is closer to the viewer.
{1:43:9 - 1:43:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:43:27 - 1:43:30} {DIALOGUE}: Captain, what's the next move?
{1:43:27 - 1:43:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:43:34 - 1:43:36} {DIALOGUE}: The question is, Mr. Decker, is there a next move...
{1:43:34 - 1:43:40} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 345 INT. V'GER - THE ENTERPRISE
{1:43:34 - 1:43:40} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: moving through the chamber, pulled by the invisible tractor beam, toward the OPENING -- toward the next chamber which, from this POV seems even larger, more forbidding.
{1:43:34 - 1:43:40} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 346 INT. BRIDGE
{1:43:34 - 1:43:40} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as the four officers step down onto the bridge, Spock hurrying to his science station, Kirk to the center seat.
{1:43:34 - 1:43:40} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:43:38 - 1:43:40} {DIALOGUE}: Resume duty stations, Mr. Decker.
{1:43:38 - 1:43:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Kirk attends to his console, Deck is at an intercom:
{1:43:38 - 1:43:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:43:38 - 1:43:43} {META_DATA}: (into intercom, voice amplified)
{1:43:41 - 1:43:43} {DIALOGUE}: All personnel resume stations...!
{1:43:41 - 1:43:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At the same time the lights are brightening -- and members of the bridge crew begin returning.
{1:43:41 - 1:43:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All this time there is an ever increasing sense of movement.
{1:43:41 - 1:43:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk glances at Decker:
{1:43:41 - 1:43:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:43:48 - 1:43:52} {DIALOGUE}: Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
{1:43:48 - 1:43:57} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:43:54 - 1:43:57} {DIALOGUE}: I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.
{1:43:54 - 1:44:4} {META_DATA}: (slight smile)
{1:43:54 - 1:44:4} {DIALOGUE}: But it's the only game in town.
{1:43:54 - 1:44:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk reacts, pleased, a split beat at Decker's "our" hand, and goes on:
{1:43:54 - 1:44:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk throws him a look of appreciation, then, abruptly his manner changes as he addresses Chekov:
{1:43:54 - 1:44:4} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:44:1 - 1:44:4} {DIALOGUE}: Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
{1:44:1 - 1:44:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CHEKOV
{1:44:5 - 1:44:8} {DIALOGUE}: They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {META_DATA}: (a beat; then into intercom)
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {DIALOGUE}: Engineering...
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 347 INT. ENGINEERING - SCOTT
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: at his console, a female engineering technician (CHIEF ROSS) nearby, the usual engine room ambience in the b.g., as:
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTT
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {DIALOGUE}: Scott, here, sir.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 348 INT. BRIDGE - KIRK WITH AN ANGLE ON SPOCK
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as Kirk hesitates, glances around at the crew -- now all having resumed their stations -- and then grimly looks at "Ilia" who still remains at the rail.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {META_DATA}: (into intercom, eyes on "Ilia")
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {DIALOGUE}: Mr. Scott, be prepared to execute Starfleet order two zero zero five.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hearing this, Spock whirls around -- peers incredulously at Kirk.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He appears for a moment to be incensed at Kirk's words.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he realizes and understands Kirk's position and turns, sadly resigned, back to his work.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 349 INT. ENGINEERING
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as Scott, too, hears this, but his reaction is of grim acceptance.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Not so Chief Ross; she is horrified.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTT
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {META_DATA}: (with a glance at Ross, into intercom)
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {DIALOGUE}: When, Captain?
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK'S INTERCOM VOICE
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {DIALOGUE}: On my command.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTT
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {META_DATA}: (somberly, into intercom)
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {DIALOGUE}: Aye, sir.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And Scott hits buttons on his console, now moves to step from his station, nearly collides with Ross, who clearly is bravely struggling to maintain her poise and dignity:
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ROSS
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {DIALOGUE}: Why has the Captain ordered self- destruct, sir?
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTT
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {META_DATA}: (a beat; gently)
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {DIALOGUE}: I would say, lass, because he thinks -- he hopes -- that when we go up... we'll take V'ger with us.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ROSS
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {DIALOGUE}: Will we?
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTT
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {META_DATA}: (with grim satisfaction)
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {DIALOGUE}: When that much matter and anti- matter are brought together?
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {DIALOGUE}: Oh, yes; we will, indeed.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 350 EXT. ENTERPRISE - INT. V'GER
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The ship passing now through a chamber that is vastly more active than anything we have previously seen.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Directly ahead appears to be an area that dispatches powerfields; a tremendous volume of them seem to ema- nate and converge there.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The medium from which the ship moves appears almost solid, to the point where it seems incredible that the ship can be pulled through it at all.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The entire chamber pulses with machine- like, alien life.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This should even be evidenced in the booming POWERFIELD LIGHTENING BOLTS as they course in ever more frighteningly close proximity to the ship as:
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {META_DATA}: 350A INT BRIDGE - INCLUDING THE VIEWER
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crew all watching the awesome spectacle of V'ger's interior (on the viewer) as the Enterprise is being pulled toward the brain complex.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All are somewhat sub- dued, for all realize how their journey will end -- but at the same time they also realize there is no other way.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The CAMERA PANS, catching facial reactions -- as, in the b.g., we HEAR a constant flow of AD-LIBBED crew comments:
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CHEKOV
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {DIALOGUE}: Twenty-five minutes to device activation, sir.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {META_DATA}: ALT. (Twenty-two) ALT. (Eighteen)
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: UHURA

{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DIFALCO
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {DIALOGUE}: We are seventeen kilometers inside the vessel...
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {META_DATA}: 351 ANGLE ON SPOCK
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His back to the viewer, the angle does not reveal his facial features, but we can discern him struggling to contain his feelings.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {META_DATA}: 352 WIDER ANGLE (INCLUDE KIRK, McCOY, AND DECKER)
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk's back to Spock as he watches the viewer, Kirk now turning toward Spock.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {DIALOGUE}: Spock... Spock...
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock does not respond, then Kirk reacts with momentary annoyance, then realizes Spock is totally distracted.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk peers at him a moment, then suddenly rises and steps up to:
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {META_DATA}: 353 SPOCK'S STATION - KIRK AND SPOCK (McCOY IN B.G.)
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as Kirk arrives, with Spock still facing away from him, clearly distracted.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {META_DATA}: (starts)
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {DIALOGUE}: Mr. Spock -- I think...
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock moves to face him, turning fully INTO the CAMERA so we can see now, just under Spock's eye:
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A tear!
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Welling fom the eye, rolling down his cheek.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk is speechless a moment, glances at McCoy who has also witnessed this phenomenon, and started toward Spock; but Kirk gestures McCoy to stay back, as he addresses Spock:
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {META_DATA}: (quiet, feeling)
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {DIALOGUE}: Not for us?
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {DIALOGUE}: No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock pauses as Kirk peers incredulously at him, then continues:
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {META_DATA}: (continuing)
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {DIALOGUE}: I weep for V'ger, as I would for a brother -- far more knowledgeable than I -- and yet one step behind.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {META_DATA}: 354 ANGLE ON McCOY AND DECKER
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Listening, McCoy's face reflecting concern; Decker's face compassion and understanding, with Decker step- ping closer to Spock, as Spock continues:
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {DIALOGUE}: As I was -- when I came aboard... so is V'ger now: empty, incomplete.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {DIALOGUE}: Searching.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {DIALOGUE}: Logic and knowledge are not enough.
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {META_DATA}: (with empathy)
{1:44:5 - 1:44:16} {DIALOGUE}: Spock, are you saying that you found, what you needed -- but V'ger hasn't?

{1:51:45 - 1:52:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:51:45 - 1:52:34} {META_DATA}: (continuing; into communicator)
{1:51:45 - 1:52:34} {DIALOGUE}: Kirk here.
{1:51:45 - 1:52:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: UHURA'S INTERCOM VOICE
{1:52:31 - 1:52:34} {DIALOGUE}: We now have the response code, sir.
{1:52:31 - 1:53:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:53:53 - 1:53:55} {DIALOGUE}: Stand by.
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {DIALOGUE}: Transmit it on my orders.
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The three of them exchange looks -- Kirk, Spock and McCoy exchanging a silent moment of friendship and resignation.
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then Kirk lifts his communicator again:
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {META_DATA}: (continuing)
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {DIALOGUE}: Enterprise... transmit.
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {META_DATA}: 376 DECKER AND "ILIA"
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: catching Decker in the midst of pressing a control on his tricorder.
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Both he and "Ilia" are watching Kirk and the others closely.
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now Decker looks down at the tricorder's face.
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He nods:
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {DIALOGUE}: Recording...
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {META_DATA}: 377 KIRK, SPOCK AND McCOY
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: still waiting.
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They continue to wait.
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: McCoy shifts uncomfortably, throws Kirk a puzzled glance.
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk finally lifts his communicator.
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {DIALOGUE}: Enterprise, are you transmitting?
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: UHURA'S INTERCOM VOICE
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {DIALOGUE}: Affirmative, Captain.
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {DIALOGUE}: For some time now.
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {DIALOGUE}: Confirm code and transmitting frequency.
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CHEKOV'S INTERCOM VOICE
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {DIALOGUE}: Both signal and frequency confirmed, sir.
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {META_DATA}: (calling)
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {DIALOGUE}: Captain Kirk!
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {META_DATA}: 378 VARIOUS ANGLES
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as the others turn to Decker and "Ilia."
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {META_DATA}: (continuing)
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {DIALOGUE}: The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.
{1:53:53 - 1:54:7} {META_DATA}: (indicating into hatch)
{1:54:4 - 1:54:7} {DIALOGUE}: The antenna leads have been disconnected.
{1:54:4 - 1:54:27} {DIALOGUE}: V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
{1:54:4 - 1:54:27} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:54:25 - 1:54:27} {DIALOGUE}: Capture God!
{1:54:25 - 1:56:15} {DIALOGUE}: In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!
{1:54:25 - 1:56:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:54:25 - 1:56:15} {DIALOGUE}: And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...
{1:54:25 - 1:56:15} {META_DATA}: (indicates into access)
{1:54:25 - 1:56:15} {DIALOGUE}: ... point here, Captain.
{1:54:25 - 1:56:15} {DIALOGUE}: It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
{1:54:25 - 1:56:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:54:25 - 1:56:15} {META_DATA}: (lifting communicator)
{1:54:25 - 1:56:15} {DIALOGUE}: Enterprise, I want that signal again.
{1:54:25 - 1:56:15} {DIALOGUE}: Transmit!
{1:54:25 - 1:56:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then Kirk touches a control on his tricorder exactly as Decker did earlier.
{1:54:25 - 1:56:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he looks up, reacts as he sees Decker holding his own tricorder up -- and a smile playing on Decker's face.
{1:54:25 - 1:56:15} {META_DATA}: 379 ACTION ANGLE
{1:54:25 - 1:56:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as Kirk suddenly pivots, races toward Decker -- but he passes too close to the "Ilia"-probe.
{1:54:25 - 1:56:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It sends him spinning back, tumbling to his knees.
{1:54:25 - 1:56:15} {META_DATA}: 380 AT KIRK
{1:54:25 - 1:56:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as KIRK starts up to scramble to his feet but Spock has stepped in, putting a hand on Kirk's shoulder and re straining him.
{1:54:25 - 1:56:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:56:13 - 1:56:15} {DIALOGUE}: Jim... he wants it.
{1:56:13 - 1:56:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DECKER
{1:56:13 - 1:56:15} {DIALOGUE}: You got the Enterprise, it's what you wanted.
{1:56:13 - 1:56:15} {DIALOGUE}: This is what I want.
{1:56:13 - 1:56:15} {META_DATA}: (smiles)
{1:56:13 - 1:56:15} {DIALOGUE}: But, Jim...
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {META_DATA}: (now very seriously)
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {DIALOGUE}: ... I'm the right choice for this mission.
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then Decker shoves the tricorder into the access hatch.
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {META_DATA}: 381 VARIOUS EFFECTS SHOTS - DECKER BEING FUSED - V'GER
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: TRANSCENDING (S)
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For just an instant nothing happens -- and then a BLINDING SHAFT OF LIGHT STRIKES Decker.
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The color becomes BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER, begins spiraling through the room.
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: "Ilia" stes toward Decker, is caught in the LIGHT, and instantly VANISHES in a BRILLIANT WHITE GLOW.
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We SEE Decker seeming to grow larger -- as if his molecular pattern is expanding.
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A SPECTACULAR SERIES OF VISUALS., THE SPIRALING LIGHT enveloping the entire area.
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All this emanating from Decker's body, becoming LARGER -- also BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER until now it is almost transparent.
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And the SPIRALING now expanding in all directions, and the room itself starting to dissolve, vanishing into nothingness -- and all commencing to slip into the new dimension.
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk, Spock and McCoy stand transfixed another instant.
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Around them, V'ger seems to be TRANSFORMING INTO BRIL- LIANT, LOVELY PATTERNS.
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They all turn and race into the complex in the direction of their vessel.
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 382 EXT. EARTH ORBIT - AN ENERGY BOLT (S)
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It too seems to be flowering into loveliness, brilliant, graceful patterns as they seem to slip through to another dimension, vanishing.
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 383 EXT. V'GER - FULL SHOT
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The "FLOWERING" EFFECT now spreading outward, V'ger's massive shape becoming a spiraling pattern of twisting, graceful shapes and brilliant colors -- a transcendence into another dimension.
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then all of that is left is a shimmering, jewel-like point of light -- and then it too fades -- and reveals there in the blue-black of space, the U.S.S. Enterprise.
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 384 INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING THE VIEWER (O)
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: which shows now only space and its familiar star patterns.
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All gaze at the viewer, awed at what they've seen and undergone.
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They exchange looks silently, no one wanting to be the first to try to comment on some- thing which is beyond mere words.
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We HEAR an ELEVATOR DOOR, Scott and Chapel ENTER the bridge and stand silently watching.
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {DIALOGUE}: Well, it certainly has been... interesting.
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {DIALOGUE}: Spock, we were its answer!
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:56:13 - 1:59:16} {META_DATA}: (nods)
{1:59:13 - 1:59:16} {DIALOGUE}: Yes, Captain.
{1:59:13 - 1:59:43} {DIALOGUE}: It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
{1:59:13 - 1:59:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:59:40 - 1:59:43} {DIALOGUE}: ... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
{1:59:40 - 2:0:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{1:59:40 - 2:0:19} {META_DATA}: (looks at Kirk; then)
{1:59:40 - 2:0:19} {DIALOGUE}: I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
{1:59:40 - 2:0:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: McCOY
{1:59:40 - 2:0:19} {DIALOGUE}: Spock... you're quoting poetry?
{1:59:40 - 2:0:19} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spock's cold look at McCoy is interrupted by:
{1:59:40 - 2:0:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: UHURA
{1:59:40 - 2:0:19} {DIALOGUE}: Starfleet signal, Captain!
{1:59:40 - 2:0:19} {DIALOGUE}: Return to orbital dockyard for inspection.
{1:59:40 - 2:0:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:59:40 - 2:0:19} {DIALOGUE}: Ignore that signal.
{1:59:40 - 2:0:19} {META_DATA}: (to Scott)
{2:0:15 - 2:0:19} {DIALOGUE}: Shall we give the Enterprise a proper shakedown, Mr. Scott?
{2:0:15 - 2:0:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTT
{2:0:15 - 2:0:23} {META_DATA}: (suddenly beaming)
{2:0:20 - 2:0:23} {DIALOGUE}: I'd say it's time for that, I would, sir.
{2:0:20 - 2:0:26} {META_DATA}: (toward Spock)
{2:0:23 - 2:0:26} {DIALOGUE}: We can have you back on Vulcan in four days, Mr. Spock.
{2:0:23 - 2:0:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{2:0:23 - 2:0:34} {META_DATA}: (coolly)
{2:0:23 - 2:0:34} {DIALOGUE}: I have no business on Vulcan, Engineer.
{2:0:23 - 2:0:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk and Spock exchange a look -- then Kirk turns to the helm.
{2:0:23 - 2:0:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{2:0:32 - 2:0:34} {DIALOGUE}: Ahead Warp One, Mr. Sulu.
{2:0:32 - 2:0:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DIFALCO
{2:0:34 - 2:0:37} {DIALOGUE}: Heading, sir?
{2:0:34 - 2:0:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{2:0:34 - 2:0:43} {META_DATA}: (taking center seat; indicates generally)
{2:0:41 - 2:0:43} {DIALOGUE}: Out there.
{2:0:41 - 2:0:47} {DIALOGUE}: Thataway.
{2:0:41 - 2:0:47} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{2:0:41 - 2:0:47} {META_DATA}: (nods gravely)
{2:0:41 - 2:0:47} {DIALOGUE}: A most logical choice, Captain.
{2:0:41 - 2:0:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then the trace of a smile comes over Spock's face.
{2:0:41 - 2:0:47} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 385 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (S)
{2:0:41 - 2:0:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Planet Earth in the distance, and receding in size as the starship heads out the other direction.
{2:0:41 - 2:0:47} {META_DATA}: FADE OUT.
{2:0:41 - 2:0:47} {META_DATA}: THE END
{2:0:41 - 2:0:47} {META_DATA}: </font></center>
