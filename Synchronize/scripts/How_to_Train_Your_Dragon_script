{0:45:5 - 0:45:7} {DIALOGUE}: No, no...come back down towards me.
{0:45:5 - 0:46:5} {DIALOGUE}: Come back down-- Hiccup extends his arms and legs, giving himself as much surface area as he can.

{0:45:5 - 0:46:5} {DIALOGUE}: After a few more misses, Hiccup finally GRABS HOLD of the harness and manages to lock in -- just in time to pull Toothless out of his dive... barely shy of the tree tops.

{0:45:5 - 0:46:5} {DIALOGUE}: Hiccup pulls the cheat sheet from his teeth and attempts to check positions.
{0:45:5 - 0:46:5} {DIALOGUE}: It flaps violently in the turbulence, making it impossible.

{0:45:5 - 0:46:5} {DIALOGUE}: Together, they manage a tight, hair-rasing series of split- second turns, making it to the open water, unscathed.
{0:45:5 - 0:46:5} {DIALOGUE}: Hiccup takes a breath and glances back at the death-defying obstacle course, now safely behind them.
{0:45:5 - 0:46:5} {DIALOGUE}: He beams, relieved.
