{0:0:0 - 0:0:12} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Joe flips through a small address book.
{0:0:0 - 0:0:12} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mr. Pink is telling a long and involved story about Madonna.
{0:0:0 - 0:0:12} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{0:0:9 - 0:0:12} {DIALOGUE}: "Like a Virgin" is all about a girl who digs a guy with a big dick.
{0:0:12 - 0:0:14} {DIALOGUE}: The whole song is a metaphor for big dicks.
{0:0:12 - 0:0:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. BLUE
{0:0:12 - 0:0:19} {DIALOGUE}: No it's not.
{0:0:16 - 0:0:19} {DIALOGUE}: It's about a girl who is very vulnerable and she's been fucked over a few times.
{0:0:16 - 0:0:26} {DIALOGUE}: Then she meets some guy who's really sensitive--
{0:0:16 - 0:0:26} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{0:0:22 - 0:0:26} {DIALOGUE}: --Whoa...whoa...time out Greenbay.
{0:0:22 - 0:0:26} {DIALOGUE}: Tell that bullshit to the tourists.
{0:0:22 - 0:0:28} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JOE
{0:0:22 - 0:0:28} {META_DATA}: (looking through his address book)
{0:0:26 - 0:0:28} {DIALOGUE}: Toby...who the fuck is Toby?
{0:0:26 - 0:0:33} {DIALOGUE}: Toby...Toby...think...think... think...
{0:0:26 - 0:0:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{0:0:28 - 0:0:33} {DIALOGUE}: It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy.
{0:0:33 - 0:0:35} {DIALOGUE}: Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
{0:0:33 - 0:0:39} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. ORANGE
{0:0:35 - 0:0:39} {DIALOGUE}: Which one is "True Blue?"
{0:0:35 - 0:0:39} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NICE GUY EDDIE
{0:0:35 - 0:0:39} {DIALOGUE}: You don't remember "True Blue?"
{0:0:35 - 0:0:39} {DIALOGUE}: That was a big ass hit for Madonna.
{0:0:39 - 0:0:43} {DIALOGUE}: Shit, I don't even follow this Tops In Pops shit, and I've at least heard of "True Blue."
{0:0:39 - 0:0:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. ORANGE
{0:0:43 - 0:0:46} {DIALOGUE}: Look, asshole, I didn't say I ain't heard of it.
{0:0:43 - 0:0:46} {DIALOGUE}: All I asked was how does it go?
{0:0:46 - 0:0:48} {DIALOGUE}: Excuse me for not being the world's biggest Madonna fan.
{0:0:46 - 0:0:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. BROWN
{0:0:46 - 0:0:53} {DIALOGUE}: I hate Madonna.
{0:0:46 - 0:0:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. BLUE
{0:0:51 - 0:0:53} {DIALOGUE}: I like her early stuff.
{0:0:53 - 0:0:56} {DIALOGUE}: You know, "Lucky Star," "Borderline" - but once she got into her "Papa Don't Preach" phase, I don't know, I tuned out.
{0:0:53 - 0:0:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{0:0:53 - 0:0:59} {DIALOGUE}: Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here.
{0:0:56 - 0:0:59} {DIALOGUE}: You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
{0:0:56 - 0:1:1} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JOE

{0:0:56 - 0:1:1} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{0:0:59 - 0:1:1} {DIALOGUE}: What's that?
{0:0:59 - 0:1:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JOE
{0:0:59 - 0:1:22} {DIALOGUE}: I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age.
{0:0:59 - 0:1:22} {DIALOGUE}: Toby what?
{0:0:59 - 0:1:22} {DIALOGUE}: What the fuck was her last name?
{0:0:59 - 0:1:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{0:0:59 - 0:1:22} {DIALOGUE}: Where was I?
{0:0:59 - 0:1:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. ORANGE
{0:0:59 - 0:1:22} {DIALOGUE}: You said "True Blue" was about a nice girl who finds a sensitive fella.
{0:1:19 - 0:1:22} {DIALOGUE}: But "Like a Virgin" was a metaphor for big dicks.
{0:1:19 - 0:1:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{0:1:22 - 0:1:24} {DIALOGUE}: Let me tell ya what "Like a Virgin"'s about.
{0:1:24 - 0:1:27} {DIALOGUE}: It's about some cooze who's a regular fuck machine.
{0:1:30 - 0:1:33} {DIALOGUE}: I mean all the time, morning, day, night, afternoon, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.
{0:1:30 - 0:1:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. BLUE
{0:1:33 - 0:1:35} {DIALOGUE}: How many dicks was that?
{0:1:33 - 0:1:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{0:1:33 - 0:1:35} {DIALOGUE}: A lot.
{0:1:33 - 0:1:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{0:1:35 - 0:1:38} {DIALOGUE}: Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby.
{0:1:38 - 0:1:42} {DIALOGUE}: This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape."
{0:1:42 - 0:1:46} {DIALOGUE}: He's diggin tunnels.
{0:1:46 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: Now she's gettin this serious dick action, she's feelin something she ain't felt since forever.
{0:1:46 - 0:1:52} {DIALOGUE}: Pain.
{0:1:46 - 0:1:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JOE
{0:1:50 - 0:1:52} {DIALOGUE}: Chew?
{0:1:50 - 0:1:52} {DIALOGUE}: Toby Chew?

{0:1:50 - 0:1:54} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{0:1:52 - 0:1:54} {DIALOGUE}: It hurts.
{0:1:52 - 0:1:54} {DIALOGUE}: It hurts her.
{0:1:54 - 0:1:57} {DIALOGUE}: It shouldn't hurt.
{0:1:54 - 0:1:57} {DIALOGUE}: Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now.
{0:1:57 - 0:1:59} {DIALOGUE}: But when this cat fucks her, it hurts.
{0:2:0 - 0:2:3} {DIALOGUE}: It hurts like the first time.
{0:2:3 - 0:2:5} {DIALOGUE}: The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin.
{0:2:8 - 0:2:10} {DIALOGUE}: Hence, "Like a Virgin."
{0:2:8 - 0:2:13} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The fellas crack up.
{0:2:8 - 0:2:13} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JOE
{0:2:12 - 0:2:13} {DIALOGUE}: Wong?
{0:2:12 - 0:2:17} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK

{0:2:12 - 0:2:17} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mr. White snatches the address book from Joe's hand.
{0:2:12 - 0:2:17} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They fight, but they're not really mad at each other.

{0:3:38 - 0:3:42} {DIALOGUE}: They say it in the song.
{0:3:38 - 0:3:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NICE GUY EDDIE
{0:3:42 - 0:3:46} {DIALOGUE}: I know, I heard it.
{0:3:48 - 0:3:50} {DIALOGUE}: I musta zoned out whenever that part came on before.
{0:3:48 - 0:3:50} {DIALOGUE}: I thought when she said that little sister stuff, she was talkin about her sister- in-law, the cheatin wife.
{0:3:48 - 0:3:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JOE
{0:3:48 - 0:3:50} {DIALOGUE}: No, she did it.

{0:4:41 - 0:4:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{0:4:43 - 0:4:46} {DIALOGUE}: I don't tip because society says I gotta.
{0:4:43 - 0:4:51} {DIALOGUE}: I tip when somebody deserves a tip.
{0:4:46 - 0:4:51} {DIALOGUE}: When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra.
{0:4:51 - 0:4:53} {DIALOGUE}: But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds.
{0:4:55 - 0:4:57} {DIALOGUE}: As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin their job.
{0:4:55 - 0:4:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. BLUE
{0:4:57 - 0:4:59} {DIALOGUE}: Our girl was nice.

{0:4:59 - 0:5:10} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. BLONDE
{0:4:59 - 0:5:10} {DIALOGUE}: What's something special, take ya in the kitchen and suck your dick?

{0:4:59 - 0:5:10} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NICE GUY EDDIE

{0:5:7 - 0:5:14} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WRITE
{0:5:10 - 0:5:14} {DIALOGUE}: Look, I ordered coffee.
{0:5:10 - 0:5:14} {DIALOGUE}: Now we've been here a long fuckin time, and she's only filled my cup three times.
{0:5:14 - 0:5:16} {DIALOGUE}: When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
{0:5:14 - 0:5:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. BLONDE
{0:5:16 - 0:5:19} {DIALOGUE}: What if she's too busy?
{0:5:16 - 0:5:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{0:5:19 - 0:5:22} {DIALOGUE}: The words "too busy" shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary.
{0:5:19 - 0:5:26} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NICE GUY EDDIE
{0:5:25 - 0:5:26} {DIALOGUE}: Excuse me, Mr. White, but the last thing you need is another cup of coffee.

{0:5:33 - 0:5:36} {DIALOGUE}: When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
{0:5:33 - 0:5:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NICE GUY EDDIE
{0:5:33 - 0:5:38} {DIALOGUE}: Ahh, now we're getting down to it.
{0:5:33 - 0:5:38} {DIALOGUE}: It's not just that he's a cheap bastard--
{0:5:33 - 0:5:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. ORANGE
{0:5:33 - 0:5:38} {DIALOGUE}: --It is that too--
{0:5:33 - 0:5:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NICE GUY EDDIE
{0:5:33 - 0:5:38} {DIALOGUE}: --It is that too.

{0:25:27 - 0:25:41} {DIALOGUE}: But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous.

{0:25:42 - 0:25:45} {DIALOGUE}: But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know.

{0:28:53 - 0:28:56} {DIALOGUE}: That bullet in his belly is my fault.
{0:28:56 - 0:28:59} {DIALOGUE}: Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me.

{0:29:34 - 0:29:38} {DIALOGUE}: Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us.

{0:29:47 - 0:29:51} {DIALOGUE}: If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.
{0:29:47 - 0:30:2} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE

{0:30:10 - 0:30:17} {DIALOGUE}: Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.

{1:7:33 - 1:9:54} {DIALOGUE}: You motherfuckers been smokin for five years, be a adult about it."
{1:7:33 - 1:9:54} {DIALOGUE}: Finally I just told my connection, count me out.
