{0:0:0 - 0:2:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's a bleak, windy morning, the kind that clears the streets of all but the winos (who carry their own heaters), and the point-men for juvenile gangs.

{0:0:0 - 0:2:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is a spot for the numbers racket, a place immune from legal interference, where any sucker can bet on a number between 1 and 1000 in the hope of getting the 600 to 1 payoff that goes to those few who guess right.

{0:0:0 - 0:2:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mottola, noticing that his entrance has aroused little interest, saunters over to the Phone Girl and gives her a little pinch on the cheek.

{0:3:56 - 0:4:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The stranger yells at Mottola to cover his side of the alley, and then readies himself for the arrival of the thief.

{0:3:56 - 0:4:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just as the thief is about to run on by, the stranger throws his suitcase at the little man's legs, sending him sprawling and separating him from the wallet he's been carrying in his left hand.
