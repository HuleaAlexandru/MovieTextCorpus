{0:39:41 - 0:42:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: KEEP OUT.
{0:39:41 - 0:42:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: NO TRESPASSING."
{0:39:41 - 0:42:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The chain-link itself actually extends over the flood channel and down into it, making access along the channel itself impossible.

{0:39:41 - 0:42:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes loses himself among the ivy in the channel.
{0:39:41 - 0:42:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He waits.
{0:39:41 - 0:42:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The men seem to have passed him by.
{0:39:41 - 0:42:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But there is another SOUND now.
{0:39:41 - 0:42:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An echoing growing sound.

{0:39:41 - 0:42:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But the force of the stream batters him and carries him with it until he's brought rudely to the chainlink fence.
{0:39:41 - 0:42:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It stops him cold.
{0:39:41 - 0:42:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's nearly strained through it.
{0:39:41 - 0:42:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Swearing and choking, he pulls himself out of the rushing water by means of the fence itself.
{0:39:41 - 0:42:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Drenched, battered, he slowly climbs back over the fence and makes his way toward his car.
{0:39:41 - 0:42:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: AT GITTES' CAR

{1:1:19 - 1:1:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS

{1:2:21 - 1:2:28} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{1:2:24 - 1:2:28} {DIALOGUE}: Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?

{1:3:16 - 1:3:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{1:3:21 - 1:3:24} {DIALOGUE}: You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
{1:3:21 - 1:3:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This stops Gittes.
{1:3:21 - 1:3:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He seems faintly mused by it.
{1:3:21 - 1:3:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS

{1:3:35 - 1:3:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{1:3:44 - 1:3:46} {DIALOGUE}: Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
{1:3:44 - 1:3:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{1:3:44 - 1:3:52} {META_DATA}: (grunts, then)
{1:3:50 - 1:3:52} {DIALOGUE}: 'Course I'm respectable.
{1:3:50 - 1:3:52} {DIALOGUE}: I'm old.

{1:4:13 - 1:4:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES

{1:4:21 - 1:4:27} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are dressed like Spanish dons on horseback.
{1:4:21 - 1:4:27} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For the most part they are fat in the saddle and pass along in disordered review to the music.
{1:4:21 - 1:4:27} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{1:4:25 - 1:4:27} {DIALOGUE}: Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection.
