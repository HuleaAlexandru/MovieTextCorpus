{0:19:54 - 0:19:56} {DIALOGUE}: This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons.
{0:19:58 - 0:19:59} {DIALOGUE}: Pretty vague.
{0:19:59 - 0:20:1} {DIALOGUE}: Where do you start looking?

{1:47:53 - 1:48:0} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: HENRY
{1:47:53 - 1:48:0} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: calls to his son.

{1:47:57 - 1:49:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His hands claw for the opposite wall but he is going to fall 100 feet to his death.
{1:47:57 - 1:49:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then—he doesn't!
{1:47:57 - 1:49:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He appears to be held up by thin air as he lands on his hands and knees.
{1:47:57 - 1:49:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INDY looks around and down and now he figures it out.
{1:47:57 - 1:49:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ingeniously, the First Crusaders have painted a pathway to align with the rocks 100 feet below.
{1:47:57 - 1:49:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is a perfect forced perspective image of the rocks below with lines from a hundred feet continuing six feet below his sight line where his feet are stepping.
{1:47:57 - 1:49:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's painted to blend in with the rocks below.
{1:47:57 - 1:49:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Highly evolved camouflage... in perfect alignment with everything we see below.
{1:47:57 - 1:49:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When INDY leans out to the left or right... that's when he sees the perfect alignment shift that betrays the trick.
{1:47:57 - 1:49:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Indy throws some dirt on the bridge and he crosses it like the first Crusader from the painting over Henry's desk.
{1:47:57 - 1:49:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Indy crawls through a small opening in the side of the cliff and enters a Temple.

{1:47:57 - 1:49:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When the GRAIL KNIGHT sees INDY he gets wearily to his feet and, surprisingly, prepares to give combat...taking up his two-handed broadsword...he comes at Indy, attempting to swing the huge, heavy sword but finding the effort almost too much.
{1:47:57 - 1:49:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Indy dodges two or three clumsy swings of the sword, making no attempt to fight back...until the Knight, exhausted, drops the sword and collapses.
{1:47:57 - 1:49:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Indy approaches him and raises the visor and we see that the Knight is a very ancient man.
