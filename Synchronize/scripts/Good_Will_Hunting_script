{0:17:19 - 0:17:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARK

{0:17:19 - 0:17:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CHUCKIE
{0:17:19 - 0:17:34} {DIALOGUE}: To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much.
{0:17:32 - 0:17:34} {DIALOGUE}: The class was rather elementary.
{0:17:32 - 0:17:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARK
{0:17:32 - 0:17:34} {DIALOGUE}: Elementary?
{0:17:35 - 0:17:36} {DIALOGUE}: Oh, I don't doubt that it was.

{0:17:40 - 0:17:51} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CHUCKIE

{0:17:48 - 0:17:54} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARK
{0:17:51 - 0:17:54} {DIALOGUE}: There's no problem.
{0:17:54 - 0:17:57} {DIALOGUE}: I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies.
{0:18:1 - 0:18:6} {DIALOGUE}: My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian precapitalist and...
{0:18:1 - 0:18:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will, who at this point has migrated to Chuckie's side and is completely fed-up, includes himself in the conversation.
{0:18:1 - 0:18:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{0:18:14 - 0:18:16} {DIALOGUE}: Of course that's your contention.
{0:18:14 - 0:18:16} {DIALOGUE}: You're a first year grad student.
{0:18:14 - 0:18:38} {DIALOGUE}: You just finished some Marxian historian, Pete Garrison prob'ly, and so naturally that's what you believe until next month when you get to James Lemon and get convinced that Virginia and Pennsylvania were strongly entrepreneurial and capitalist back in 1740.
{0:18:35 - 0:18:38} {DIALOGUE}: That'll last until sometime in your second year, then you'll be in here regurgitating Gordon Wood about the Pre-revolutionary utopia and the capital-forming effects of military mobilization.
{0:18:35 - 0:18:44} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARK
{0:18:35 - 0:18:44} {META_DATA}: (taken aback)
{0:18:41 - 0:18:44} {DIALOGUE}: Well, as a matter of fact, I won't, because Wood drastically underestimates the impact of--
{0:18:41 - 0:18:51} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{0:18:48 - 0:18:51} {DIALOGUE}: "Wood drastically underestimates the impact of social distinctions predicated upon wealth, especially inherited wealth..." You got that from "Work in Essex County," Page 421, right?
{0:18:48 - 0:19:22} {DIALOGUE}: Do you have any thoughts of your own on the subject or were you just gonna plagiarize the whole book for me?
{0:18:48 - 0:19:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clark is stunned.
{0:18:48 - 0:19:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{0:18:48 - 0:19:22} {DIALOGUE}: Look, don't try to pass yourself off as some kind of an intellect at the expense of my friend just to impress these girls.
{0:18:48 - 0:19:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clark is lost now, searching for a graceful exit, any exit.
{0:18:48 - 0:19:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{0:18:48 - 0:19:22} {DIALOGUE}: The sad thing is, in about 50 years you might start doin' some thinkin' on your own and by then you'll realize there are only two certainties in life.
{0:18:48 - 0:19:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARK
{0:18:48 - 0:19:22} {DIALOGUE}: Yeah?
{0:18:48 - 0:19:22} {DIALOGUE}: What're those?
{0:18:48 - 0:19:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{0:19:20 - 0:19:22} {DIALOGUE}: One, don't do that.
{0:19:20 - 0:19:38} {DIALOGUE}: Two -- you dropped a hundred and fifty grand on an education you coulda' picked up for a dollar fifty in late charges at the Public Library.

{0:19:20 - 0:19:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARK
{0:19:33 - 0:19:38} {DIALOGUE}: But I will have a degree, and you'll be serving my kids fries at a drive through on our way to a skiing trip.

{0:19:33 - 0:19:41} {META_DATA}: (smiles)
{0:19:38 - 0:19:41} {DIALOGUE}: Maybe.
{0:19:38 - 0:19:41} {DIALOGUE}: But at least I won't be a prick.
{0:19:38 - 0:19:46} {META_DATA}: (beat)
{0:19:41 - 0:19:46} {DIALOGUE}: And if you got a problem with that, I guess we can step outside and deal with it that way.
{0:19:41 - 0:20:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: While Will is substantially smaller than Clark, he [Clark] decides not to take Will up on his [Will's] offer.
{0:19:41 - 0:20:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{0:19:41 - 0:20:3} {DIALOGUE}: If you change your mind, I'll be over by the bar.

{0:21:7 - 0:21:18} {DIALOGUE}: What?
{0:21:7 - 0:21:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{0:21:13 - 0:21:18} {DIALOGUE}: When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.

{0:46:52 - 0:46:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL

{0:47:12 - 0:47:14} {DIALOGUE}: So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written... Michelangelo?
{0:47:14 - 0:47:18} {DIALOGUE}: You know a lot about him I bet.
{0:47:18 - 0:47:22} {DIALOGUE}: Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations.
{0:47:27 - 0:47:31} {DIALOGUE}: But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel.
{0:47:33 - 0:47:37} {DIALOGUE}: You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling.
{0:47:33 - 0:48:2} {DIALOGUE}: And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too.
{0:48:0 - 0:48:2} {DIALOGUE}: But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy.
{0:48:0 - 0:48:23} {DIALOGUE}: If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one.
{0:48:21 - 0:48:23} {DIALOGUE}: You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help.
{0:48:35 - 0:48:39} {DIALOGUE}: And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable.
{0:48:39 - 0:48:44} {DIALOGUE}: Known that someone could kill you with a look.
{0:48:39 - 0:48:48} {DIALOGUE}: That someone could rescue you from grief.
{0:48:44 - 0:48:48} {DIALOGUE}: That God had put an angel on Earth just for you.
{0:48:51 - 0:48:54} {DIALOGUE}: And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel.
{0:48:55 - 0:48:58} {DIALOGUE}: To have the love be there for her forever.
{0:48:58 - 0:49:2} {DIALOGUE}: Through anything, through cancer.
{0:48:58 - 0:49:21} {DIALOGUE}: You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you.
{0:49:16 - 0:49:21} {DIALOGUE}: And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much.
{0:49:27 - 0:49:32} {DIALOGUE}: I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal.
{0:49:27 - 0:49:47} {DIALOGUE}: I see a boy.
{0:49:43 - 0:49:47} {DIALOGUE}: Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will?
{0:49:47 - 0:49:50} {DIALOGUE}: Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw.
{0:49:47 - 0:49:59} {DIALOGUE}: You must know everything about me.
{0:49:56 - 0:49:59} {DIALOGUE}: You're an orphan, right?

{0:49:56 - 0:50:13} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SEAN
{0:50:9 - 0:50:13} {DIALOGUE}: Do you think I would presume to know the first thing about who you are because I read "Oliver Twist?"
{0:50:9 - 0:50:47} {DIALOGUE}: And I don't buy the argument that you don't want to be here, because I think you like all the attention you're getting.
{0:50:9 - 0:50:47} {DIALOGUE}: Personally, I don't care.
{0:50:9 - 0:50:47} {DIALOGUE}: There's nothing you can tell me that I can't read somewhere else.
{0:50:9 - 0:50:47} {DIALOGUE}: Unless we talk about your life.
{0:50:9 - 0:50:47} {DIALOGUE}: But you won't do that.
{0:50:44 - 0:50:47} {DIALOGUE}: Maybe you're afraid of what you might say.

{0:57:23 - 0:57:27} {DIALOGUE}: And she had the goods on me too.
{0:57:23 - 0:57:31} {DIALOGUE}: Little things I do out of habit.
{0:57:27 - 0:57:31} {DIALOGUE}: People call these things imperfections Will.
{0:57:27 - 0:57:39} {DIALOGUE}: It's just who we are.
{0:57:34 - 0:57:39} {DIALOGUE}: And we get to choose who we're going to let into out weird little worlds.
{0:57:39 - 0:57:41} {DIALOGUE}: You're not perfect.
{0:57:41 - 0:57:44} {DIALOGUE}: And let me save you the suspense, this girl you met isn't either.
{0:57:47 - 0:57:51} {DIALOGUE}: The question is, whether or not you're perfect for each other.
{0:57:57 - 0:58:0} {DIALOGUE}: You can know everything in the world, but the only way you're findin' that one out is by giving it a shot.
{0:58:0 - 0:58:3} {DIALOGUE}: You sure won't get the answer from an old fucker like me.

{1:19:47 - 1:20:5} {DIALOGUE}: This is what I'm doing with that money.
{1:19:47 - 1:20:5} {DIALOGUE}: I could have done anything I wanted.

{1:19:47 - 1:20:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL

{1:20:14 - 1:20:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{1:20:14 - 1:20:22} {DIALOGUE}: I guess.

{1:20:30 - 1:20:32} {DIALOGUE}: Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun."
{1:20:30 - 1:20:42} {DIALOGUE}: It's unnecessary.
{1:20:38 - 1:20:42} {DIALOGUE}: Especially for someone like you.
{1:20:38 - 1:20:45} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{1:20:42 - 1:20:45} {DIALOGUE}: Like me?

{1:20:45 - 1:21:1} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SKYLAR
{1:20:45 - 1:21:1} {DIALOGUE}: How did you do that?

{1:21:11 - 1:21:13} {DIALOGUE}: So you play the piano.

{1:21:18 - 1:21:28} {DIALOGUE}: He looked at a piano and saw music.
{1:21:18 - 1:21:28} {DIALOGUE}: The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy.
{1:21:18 - 1:21:28} {DIALOGUE}: They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him.
{1:21:18 - 1:21:28} {DIALOGUE}: Stone deaf.

{1:21:25 - 1:21:28} {DIALOGUE}: Not a lick.
{1:21:28 - 1:21:32} {DIALOGUE}: I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood.
{1:21:28 - 1:21:41} {DIALOGUE}: Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them.
{1:21:28 - 1:21:41} {DIALOGUE}: They saw a piano and they could play.
{1:21:37 - 1:21:41} {DIALOGUE}: I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
{1:21:37 - 1:21:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SKYLAR
{1:21:41 - 1:21:46} {DIALOGUE}: But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
{1:21:41 - 1:21:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{1:21:46 - 1:21:52} {DIALOGUE}: When it came to stuff like that I could always just play.

{1:21:46 - 1:22:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: So much so that Skylar has to kiss him, then push him away.
{1:21:46 - 1:22:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SKYLAR
{1:21:46 - 1:22:23} {DIALOGUE}: I can't believe it's taken me four years to meet you and I'm going to California in two months, Will.
{1:21:46 - 1:22:23} {META_DATA}: (beat)
{1:21:46 - 1:22:23} {DIALOGUE}: Have you ever been to California?
{1:21:46 - 1:22:23} {DIALOGUE}: I bet you'd like it.
{1:21:46 - 1:22:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will freezes.
{1:21:46 - 1:22:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{1:21:46 - 1:22:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SKYLAR

{1:22:18 - 1:22:48} {DIALOGUE}: Because then I could sleep at night.

{1:32:52 - 1:32:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{1:32:56 - 1:32:59} {DIALOGUE}: Say I'm working at N.S.A. Somebody puts a code on my desk, something nobody else can break.

{1:33:3 - 1:33:5} {DIALOGUE}: And I'm real happy with myself, 'cause I did my job well.
{1:33:5 - 1:33:9} {DIALOGUE}: But maybe that code was the location of some rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East.
{1:33:9 - 1:33:12} {DIALOGUE}: Once they have that location, they bomb the village where the rebels were hiding and fifteen hundred people I never had a problem with get killed.
{1:33:16 - 1:33:19} {DIALOGUE}: (rapid fire) Now the politicians are sayin' "send in the Marines to secure the area" 'cause they don't give a shit.
{1:33:21 - 1:33:23} {DIALOGUE}: It won't be their kid over there, gettin' shot.
{1:33:23 - 1:33:26} {DIALOGUE}: Just like it wasn't them when their number got called, 'cause they were pullin' a tour in the National Guard.
{1:33:26 - 1:33:29} {DIALOGUE}: It'll be some guy from Southie takin' shrapnel in the ass.
{1:33:31 - 1:33:34} {DIALOGUE}: And he comes home to find that the plant he used to work at got exported to the country he just got back from.
{1:33:34 - 1:33:36} {DIALOGUE}: And the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job, 'cause he'll work for fifteen cents a day and no bathroom breaks.
{1:33:42 - 1:33:45} {DIALOGUE}: Meanwhile my buddy from Southie realizes the only reason he was over there was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price.
{1:33:45 - 1:33:49} {DIALOGUE}: And of course the oil companies used the skirmish to scare up oil prices so they could turn a quick buck.
{1:33:49 - 1:33:53} {DIALOGUE}: A cute, little ancillary benefit for them but it ain't helping my buddy at two-fifty a gallon.
{1:33:49 - 1:34:13} {DIALOGUE}: And naturally they're takin' their sweet time bringin' the oil back and maybe even took the liberty of hiring an alcoholic skipper who likes to drink seven and sevens and play slalom with the icebergs and it ain't too long 'til he hits one, spills the oil, and kills all the sea-life in the North Atlantic.
{1:34:11 - 1:34:13} {DIALOGUE}: So my buddy's out of work and he can't afford to drive so he's got to walk to the job interviews which sucks 'cause the shrapnel in his ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids.
{1:34:18 - 1:34:21} {DIALOGUE}: And meanwhile he's starvin' 'cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat the only blue-plate special they're servin' is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State.
{1:34:18 - 1:34:26} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{1:34:18 - 1:34:26} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL

{1:34:21 - 1:34:26} {DIALOGUE}: I'm holdin' out for somethin' better.
{1:34:21 - 1:34:35} {DIALOGUE}: I figure I'll eliminate the middle man.
{1:34:32 - 1:34:35} {DIALOGUE}: Why not just shoot my buddy, take his job and give it to his sworn enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and join the National Guard?
{1:34:37 - 1:34:40} {DIALOGUE}: Christ, I could be elected President.

{1:44:50 - 1:44:53} {DIALOGUE}: And for 20 years he's been alone because of that.
{1:44:53 - 1:44:56} {DIALOGUE}: And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again.

{1:45:21 - 1:45:32} {DIALOGUE}: That's it.
{1:45:27 - 1:45:32} {DIALOGUE}: That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions!

{1:45:35 - 1:45:37} {DIALOGUE}: You think I'm a failure!
{1:45:35 - 1:45:37} {DIALOGUE}: I know who I am.
