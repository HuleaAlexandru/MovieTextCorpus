{0:10:16 - 0:10:29} {META_DATA}: (quickly blocking him)
{0:10:16 - 0:10:29} {DIALOGUE}: Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself.
{0:10:28 - 0:10:29} {DIALOGUE}: What do you think?
{0:10:28 - 0:10:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON
{0:10:28 - 0:10:36} {META_DATA}: (annoyed)
{0:10:32 - 0:10:36} {DIALOGUE}: You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.

{0:11:31 - 0:11:39} {DIALOGUE}: Stay to the middle.

{0:11:43 - 0:12:19} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Some are padded, with narrow observation slits, others are normal, barred... Shadowy occupants pacing, MUTTERING... Suddenly a dark figure in the next-to-last cell hurtles towards her, his face mashing grotesquely against his bars as he hisses.
{0:11:43 - 0:12:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DARK FIGURE
{0:12:17 - 0:12:19} {DIALOGUE}: I c-can sssmell your cunt!
{0:12:17 - 0:12:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice flinches momentarily, but then walks on.
{0:12:17 - 0:12:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: DR. LECTER'S CELL

{0:12:34 - 0:12:38} {DIALOGUE}: May I talk with you?
{0:12:34 - 0:12:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dr. Hannibal Lecter is lounging on his bunk, in white pajamas, reading an Italian Vogue.
{0:12:34 - 0:12:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns, considers her... A face so long out of the sun, it seems almost leached - except for the glittering eyes, and the wet red mouth.
{0:12:34 - 0:12:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He rises smoothly, crossing to stand before her; the gracious host.
{0:12:34 - 0:12:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His voice is cultured, soft.

{0:12:34 - 0:12:41} {DIALOGUE}: "We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico.

{0:12:41 - 0:12:42} {DIALOGUE}: I am, yes.
{0:12:41 - 0:12:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER

{0:12:58 - 0:13:17} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dr. Lecter's nostrils lift, as he gently, like an animal, tests the air.

{0:13:20 - 0:13:27} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:13:24 - 0:13:27} {DIALOGUE}: Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
{0:13:24 - 0:13:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:13:24 - 0:13:33} {DIALOGUE}: We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau.
{0:13:31 - 0:13:33} {DIALOGUE}: Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
{0:13:31 - 0:13:41} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:13:38 - 0:13:41} {DIALOGUE}: Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling.
{0:13:45 - 0:13:46} {DIALOGUE}: Sit.

{0:13:45 - 0:13:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He waits politely till she's settled, then sits down himself, faces her happily.
{0:13:45 - 0:13:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:13:54 - 0:13:55} {DIALOGUE}: Now then.
{0:13:56 - 0:13:58} {DIALOGUE}: What did Miggs say to you?
{0:13:56 - 0:14:0} {META_DATA}: (she is puzzled)
{0:13:58 - 0:14:0} {DIALOGUE}: "Multiple Miggs," in the next cell.
{0:14:1 - 0:14:2} {DIALOGUE}: He hissed at you.

{0:14:2 - 0:14:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE

{0:14:5 - 0:14:10} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:14:8 - 0:14:10} {DIALOGUE}: I see.
{0:14:11 - 0:14:13} {DIALOGUE}: I myself cannot.
{0:14:27 - 0:14:30} {DIALOGUE}: You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today.
{0:14:27 - 0:14:38} {DIALOGUE}: You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?

{0:14:27 - 0:14:38} {META_DATA}: (beat)

{0:14:27 - 0:14:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER

{0:14:27 - 0:14:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:14:27 - 0:14:38} {DIALOGUE}: Maybe they'll catch up.
{0:14:27 - 0:14:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:14:27 - 0:14:38} {DIALOGUE}: I have no doubt of it.
{0:14:27 - 0:14:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:14:27 - 0:14:38} {META_DATA}: (shifting uncomfortably)

{0:14:45 - 0:14:47} {DIALOGUE}: Do you know Florence?
{0:14:45 - 0:14:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:14:48 - 0:14:50} {DIALOGUE}: All that detail, just from memory...?
{0:14:48 - 0:14:54} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:14:50 - 0:14:54} {DIALOGUE}: Memory, Officer Starling, is what I have instead of view.

{0:14:50 - 0:15:20} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE

{0:14:50 - 0:15:20} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:14:50 - 0:15:20} {DIALOGUE}: No, no, no.
{0:14:50 - 0:15:20} {DIALOGUE}: You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire.
{0:15:18 - 0:15:20} {DIALOGUE}: It won't do.
{0:15:18 - 0:15:22} {DIALOGUE}: It's stupid and boring.
{0:15:18 - 0:15:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:15:20 - 0:15:22} {DIALOGUE}: I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor.
{0:15:22 - 0:15:24} {DIALOGUE}: Either you will or you won't.
{0:15:22 - 0:15:28} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:15:26 - 0:15:28} {DIALOGUE}: Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body.
{0:15:31 - 0:15:34} {DIALOGUE}: Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy!
{0:15:31 - 0:15:40} {DIALOGUE}: Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
{0:15:31 - 0:15:40} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:15:31 - 0:15:40} {DIALOGUE}: No, I came because we need -
{0:15:31 - 0:15:40} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:15:31 - 0:15:40} {DIALOGUE}: How many women has he used, our Bill?
{0:15:31 - 0:15:40} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:15:31 - 0:15:40} {DIALOGUE}: Five... so far.
{0:15:31 - 0:15:40} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:15:31 - 0:15:40} {DIALOGUE}: All flayed...?
{0:15:31 - 0:15:40} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:15:31 - 0:15:40} {DIALOGUE}: Partially, yes.
{0:15:31 - 0:15:40} {DIALOGUE}: But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved.
{0:15:31 - 0:15:40} {DIALOGUE}: If -
{0:15:31 - 0:15:40} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:15:37 - 0:15:40} {DIALOGUE}: Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill?
{0:15:40 - 0:15:43} {DIALOGUE}: Tell me.
{0:15:40 - 0:15:43} {DIALOGUE}: The newspapers won't say.
{0:15:40 - 0:15:47} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:15:40 - 0:15:47} {DIALOGUE}: I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.
{0:15:40 - 0:15:47} {META_DATA}: (he considers, then nods)
{0:15:45 - 0:15:47} {DIALOGUE}: It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide.
{0:15:47 - 0:15:51} {DIALOGUE}: They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
{0:15:47 - 0:15:57} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:15:47 - 0:15:57} {DIALOGUE}: Witless and misleading.
{0:15:53 - 0:15:57} {DIALOGUE}: Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling?
{0:15:53 - 0:16:3} {DIALOGUE}: Thrill me with your wisdom.
{0:15:53 - 0:16:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:16:1 - 0:16:3} {DIALOGUE}: It excites him.
{0:16:3 - 0:16:7} {DIALOGUE}: Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
{0:16:3 - 0:16:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:16:7 - 0:16:8} {DIALOGUE}: I didn't.
{0:16:7 - 0:16:11} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:16:7 - 0:16:11} {DIALOGUE}: No.
{0:16:10 - 0:16:11} {DIALOGUE}: You ate yours.
{0:16:10 - 0:16:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A tense beat, then a smile from him, at this small boldness.
{0:16:10 - 0:16:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:16:14 - 0:16:16} {DIALOGUE}: Send that through.
{0:16:14 - 0:16:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She rolls him the questionnaire, in his sliding food tray.
{0:16:14 - 0:16:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He rises, glances at it, turning a page or two disdainfully.
{0:16:14 - 0:16:47} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:16:44 - 0:16:47} {DIALOGUE}: Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
{0:16:44 - 0:16:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:16:44 - 0:16:53} {DIALOGUE}: No.
{0:16:44 - 0:16:53} {DIALOGUE}: I only hoped that your knowledge -
{0:16:44 - 0:16:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly he whips the tray back at her, with a metallic CLANG that makes her start.
{0:16:44 - 0:16:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His voice remains a pleasant purr.
{0:16:44 - 0:16:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:16:51 - 0:16:53} {DIALOGUE}: You're sooo ambitious, aren't you...?
{0:16:55 - 0:16:57} {DIALOGUE}: You know what you look like to me, with your good bag and your cheap shoes?
{0:16:58 - 0:16:59} {DIALOGUE}: You look like a rube.
{0:17:7 - 0:17:10} {DIALOGUE}: A well- scrubbed, hustling rube with a little, taste... Good nutrition has given you some length of bone, but you're not more than one generation from poor white trash, are you Officer Starling...?
{0:17:15 - 0:17:17} {DIALOGUE}: That accent you're trying so desperately to shed - pure West Virginia.
{0:17:15 - 0:17:20} {DIALOGUE}: What was your father, dear?
{0:17:18 - 0:17:20} {DIALOGUE}: Was he a coal miner?
{0:17:20 - 0:17:22} {DIALOGUE}: Did he stink of the lamp...?
{0:17:22 - 0:17:25} {DIALOGUE}: And oh, how quickly the boys found you!
{0:17:25 - 0:17:28} {DIALOGUE}: All those tedious, sticky fumblings, in the back seats of cars, while you could only dream of getting out.
{0:17:25 - 0:17:36} {DIALOGUE}: Getting anywhere - yes?
{0:17:32 - 0:17:36} {DIALOGUE}: Getting all the way - to the F..
{0:17:32 - 0:17:41} {DIALOGUE}: B..
{0:17:32 - 0:17:41} {DIALOGUE}: I.
{0:17:32 - 0:17:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His every word has struck her like a tiny, precise dart.
{0:17:32 - 0:17:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But she squares her jaw and won't give ground.
{0:17:32 - 0:17:41} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:17:39 - 0:17:41} {DIALOGUE}: You see a lot, Dr. Lecter.
{0:17:42 - 0:17:47} {DIALOGUE}: But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself?
{0:17:42 - 0:17:53} {DIALOGUE}: How about it...?
{0:17:50 - 0:17:53} {DIALOGUE}: Look at yourself and write down the truth.
{0:17:50 - 0:17:56} {META_DATA}: (she slams the tray back at him)
{0:17:54 - 0:17:56} {DIALOGUE}: Or maybe you're afraid to.
{0:17:54 - 0:18:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:17:54 - 0:18:8} {DIALOGUE}: You're a tough one, aren't you?
{0:17:54 - 0:18:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:17:54 - 0:18:8} {DIALOGUE}: Reasonably so.
{0:17:54 - 0:18:8} {DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{0:17:54 - 0:18:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:17:54 - 0:18:8} {DIALOGUE}: And you'd hate to think you were common.
{0:17:54 - 0:18:8} {DIALOGUE}: My, wouldn't that sting!
{0:17:54 - 0:18:8} {DIALOGUE}: Well you're far from common, Officer Starling.
{0:17:54 - 0:18:8} {DIALOGUE}: All you have is the fear of it.
{0:17:54 - 0:18:8} {META_DATA}: (beat)
{0:17:54 - 0:18:8} {DIALOGUE}: Now please excuse me.
{0:17:54 - 0:18:8} {DIALOGUE}: Good day.
{0:17:54 - 0:18:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:17:54 - 0:18:8} {DIALOGUE}: And the questionnaire...?
{0:17:54 - 0:18:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:18:6 - 0:18:8} {DIALOGUE}: A census taker once tried to test me.
{0:18:9 - 0:18:12} {DIALOGUE}: I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.
{0:18:9 - 0:19:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He steps backwards, then returns to his cot, becoming as still and remote as a statue.
{0:18:9 - 0:19:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Frustrated, Clarice hesitates, then finally shoulders her bag and goes, leaving the questionnaire in his tray.
{0:18:9 - 0:19:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But after just a few steps, as she passes -
{0:18:9 - 0:19:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MIGG'S CELL
{0:18:9 - 0:19:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She sees that creature at his bars again, hissing at her.
{0:18:9 - 0:19:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MIGGS
{0:18:9 - 0:19:5} {DIALOGUE}: I b-bit my wrist so I c-can diiiieeee!
{0:18:9 - 0:19:5} {DIALOGUE}: S-ee how it bleeeeeeeeds?
{0:18:9 - 0:19:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The dark figure suddenly flings his palm towards her, and -
{0:18:9 - 0:19:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLARICE
{0:18:9 - 0:19:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: is spattered on the face and neck - not with blood, but with pale droplets of semen.
{0:18:9 - 0:19:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She gives a little cry, touching her fingers to the wetness.
{0:18:9 - 0:19:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Stunned, near tears, she forces herself to straighten up and walk on, fumbling for a tissue.
{0:18:9 - 0:19:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: From behind her, Dr. Lecter calls out, very agitated.
{0:18:9 - 0:19:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER (O.S.)

{0:23:18 - 0:24:28} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice pulls her head back out again, reaching to take her camera from him.
{0:23:18 - 0:24:28} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She hands him a card, trying to appear nonchalant.
{0:23:18 - 0:24:28} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:24:23 - 0:24:28} {DIALOGUE}: Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha!
{0:24:23 - 0:24:32} {DIALOGUE}: - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number?
{0:24:29 - 0:24:32} {DIALOGUE}: It's our Baltimore field office.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {DIALOGUE}: They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. YOW
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {DIALOGUE}: Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks?
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {DIALOGUE}: To prevent mouse intrusion.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {META_DATA}: (beat)
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {DIALOGUE}: Good idea.

{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. STORAGE SHED - DUSK (VERY DARK)
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice squirms, on her back, through the narrow opening.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As she squeezes all the way in, she snags one thigh on the metal edge of the door.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She curses softly, shining her flashlight on her ripped khakis - there's a small streak of blood.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. YOW (O.S.)
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {DIALOGUE}: Okay, Miss Starling?
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {DIALOGUE}: Okay, Mr. Yow...
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She shines her light around.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In its narrow beam, we see -
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLARICE'S POV - UPWARD, SHIFTING
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: spiderwebs, everywhere... high stacks of cardboard boxes... a few dusty pieces of furniture... the big car, oddly long and tall, covered with a tarp... Suddenly there's a scurrying of loud MUSICAL NOTES.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice turns, scared, her beam capturing... an old upright piano.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. YOW (O.S.)
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {DIALOGUE}: You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {DIALOGUE}: That wasn't me.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. YOW (O.S.)
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {DIALOGUE}: Oh.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice crawls a bit further.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There's hardly room to stand, but she finally manages to wriggle upright, clawing away cobwebs, next to the car.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Holding her light under one arm, she takes several FLASH photos of the shed's interior, ending with the car.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, slinging her camera over the shoulder, she folds back the tarp, resting it on the roof.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The resulting clouds of dust make her cough.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE CAR
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: is an antique beauty, a 1931 Packard.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's very dusty, despite the tarp.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Curtains close off the back passenger compartment, but there's a narrow gap in them.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: More mousy RUSTLINGS.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLARICE
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: peers in through the gap, aiming her flashlight.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: HER POV - SHIFTING
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as the thin flashlight beam picks out: the broad back seat... as open album of lacy, old-fashioned Valentines... a crumpled lap rug, on the floor... and then a pair of women's shiny, high-heeled pumps... Above these, the hem of a fancy satin evening gown - and a pair of pale, stockinged legs.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice recoils, alarmed, then steadies herself.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {DIALOGUE}: Mr. Yow?
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {DIALOGUE}: Oh Mr. Yow...?
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {DIALOGUE}: It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. YOW (O.S.)
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {DIALOGUE}: Oh my!
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {DIALOGUE}: Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {DIALOGUE}: Not yet!
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {DIALOGUE}: - just wait for me.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {META_DATA}: (under the breath)
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {DIALOGUE}: Maybe in about two seconds.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She leans down with her camera, takes a FLASH through the gap, then tries the door handle.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Locked.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: So is the front door.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She looks around, aiming her light, and locates a tangle of coat-hangers, sticking out of a carton of bric-a-brac.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She pulls out one of these, straightens it quickly, bends the tip into a hook.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLOSE ANGLE
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as she jams this tool inside the join at the top of the back passenger window, then fishes around till she can snag the inside door latch, pulling up.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A satisfying CLICK.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice opens the door - it hits stacked boxes, and won't open far - then very cautiously leans inside, aiming her flashlight.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: HER POV - MOVING LIGHT BEAM
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: revealing more of the evening gown... a pair of hands, in white, elbow-length gloves - one rests on the lap, the other atop a large, beaded, drawstring evening bag... thick strands of costume pearls over the breasts... and finally the white neck stub of a female mannequin.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: No face or head.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLARICE
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: sighs with relief.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She takes a couple more FLASHES, then very carefully lifts out the Valentine album, holding it by the corners, and setting it atop the car.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then she eases herself inside, onto the back seat, as the springs SQUEAK loudly.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ONE GLOVED HAND slides off the lap, brushing Clarice's thigh.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice starts a bit, then pokes at the gloved arm, hard.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She peels back a bit of glove, revealing the white, synthetic elbow.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She smiles, shaking her head at her own jumpiness, as she reaches over the mannequin's lap to loosen the evening bag's drawstring.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A SEVERED HUMAN HEAD stares back at her, as the beaded material slides away.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice lurches back, gasping loudly, and several long, heart- pounding moments pass before she can make herself look more closely.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The head bobs gently in a pool of alcohol, in a laboratory specimen jar.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is a man's head, but grotesquely transformed, by the addition of heavy makeup, earrings, and a sodden wig, into a woman's face.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Over the years the makeup has smeared badly, and the pupils have gone almost milky white.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLARICE
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: staring at this terrible thing, is pleased to find herself quickly regaining control.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She murmurs to herself.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {DIALOGUE}: Well, Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. QUINN'S HOSPITAL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT (RAINING)
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A loud clap of THUNDER, as a flash of LIGHTNING illuminates the eerie towers and barred windows of the asylum.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MOVING ANGLE on Clarice as she climbs from her car, runs through heavy rain towards the main entrance, where a guard admits her.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. DR. LECTER'S CELL AND CORRIDOR - NIGHT (DIM LIGHT)
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On a noiseless TV screen, an evangelist rants, waving his arms.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Behind him, a swaying choir in gaudy robes.
{0:24:29 - 0:27:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE (O.S.)
{0:27:15 - 0:27:18} {DIALOGUE}: It's an anagram, isn't it, Doctor?
{0:27:15 - 0:27:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: PAN TO Clarice, with her wet hair plastered flat, sitting on the corridor floor to one side of this TV, which has been stationed so that Dr. Lecter cannot avoid seeing it.
{0:27:15 - 0:27:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:27:19 - 0:27:22} {DIALOGUE}: Hester Mofet... "The rest of me."
{0:27:22 - 0:27:26} {DIALOGUE}: Miss The-Rest-of-Me... Meaning, you rented that place.
{0:27:22 - 0:28:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: HER POV
{0:27:22 - 0:28:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: he's lost in shadows; we can't see him.
{0:27:22 - 0:28:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He doesn't respond.
{0:27:22 - 0:28:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CUTTING BETWEEN THEM
{0:27:22 - 0:28:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice and the darkened call - as she tries again.
{0:27:22 - 0:28:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:27:22 - 0:28:3} {DIALOGUE}: You put those - things in there.
{0:27:22 - 0:28:3} {DIALOGUE}: Paid for it in advance, ten years ago... Why, Dr. Lecter?
{0:27:22 - 0:28:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The food carrier suddenly SWISHES out of the cell, making her jump up.
{0:27:22 - 0:28:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In its tray is a clean, folded white towel.
{0:27:22 - 0:28:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She hesitates, then crosses, takes this.
{0:27:22 - 0:28:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:28:2 - 0:28:3} {DIALOGUE}: Thank you.
{0:28:2 - 0:28:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She sits again, rubbing her wet hair.
{0:28:2 - 0:28:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When he finally speaks, he's on the floor, too - a deeper, hunching darkness in the shadows, occasionally striped by the flickering TV light.
{0:28:2 - 0:28:6} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:28:4 - 0:28:6} {DIALOGUE}: Your bleeding has stopped.
{0:28:4 - 0:28:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:28:8 - 0:28:9} {DIALOGUE}: How did -
{0:28:8 - 0:28:13} {META_DATA}: (she stops herself)
{0:28:11 - 0:28:13} {DIALOGUE}: It's nothing.
{0:28:13 - 0:28:15} {DIALOGUE}: A scratch.
{0:28:13 - 0:28:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:28:18 - 0:28:22} {DIALOGUE}: Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
{0:28:18 - 0:28:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:28:18 - 0:28:24} {META_DATA}: (surprised, a beat)
{0:28:18 - 0:28:24} {DIALOGUE}: Why?
{0:28:22 - 0:28:24} {DIALOGUE}: Do you know something about him?
{0:28:22 - 0:28:26} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:28:24 - 0:28:26} {DIALOGUE}: I might if I saw the case file.
{0:28:26 - 0:28:28} {DIALOGUE}: You could get that for me.
{0:28:26 - 0:28:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:28:28 - 0:28:30} {DIALOGUE}: Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?"
{0:28:30 - 0:28:32} {DIALOGUE}: You wanted me to find him.
{0:28:30 - 0:28:35} {DIALOGUE}: Or do I have to wait for the lab?
{0:28:30 - 0:28:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:28:30 - 0:28:35} {META_DATA}: (sighs)
{0:28:32 - 0:28:35} {DIALOGUE}: His real name is Benjamin Raspail.
{0:28:38 - 0:28:42} {DIALOGUE}: A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...?
{0:28:44 - 0:28:47} {DIALOGUE}: I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away.
{0:28:44 - 0:28:53} {DIALOGUE}: Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments.
{0:28:44 - 0:28:53} {DIALOGUE}: You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
{0:28:44 - 0:28:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:28:51 - 0:28:53} {DIALOGUE}: If you didn't kill him, then who did?
{0:28:51 - 0:28:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:28:53 - 0:28:55} {DIALOGUE}: Who can say...?
{0:28:55 - 0:28:56} {DIALOGUE}: Best thing for him, really.
{0:28:56 - 0:28:59} {DIALOGUE}: His therapy was going nowhere.
{0:28:56 - 0:29:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:28:56 - 0:29:7} {DIALOGUE}: Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
{0:28:56 - 0:29:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:29:5 - 0:29:7} {DIALOGUE}: And have them clomping about in my life?
{0:29:5 - 0:29:21} {DIALOGUE}: Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.
{0:29:5 - 0:29:21} {META_DATA}: (beat)
{0:29:18 - 0:29:21} {DIALOGUE}: How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice?
{0:29:18 - 0:29:24} {DIALOGUE}: May I call you Clarice?
{0:29:18 - 0:29:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:29:22 - 0:29:24} {DIALOGUE}: Scared, at first.
{0:29:25 - 0:29:26} {DIALOGUE}: Then - exhilarated.
{0:29:25 - 0:29:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:29:25 - 0:29:29} {DIALOGUE}: Ahhh... Why?
{0:29:25 - 0:29:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:29:25 - 0:29:29} {DIALOGUE}: Because you weren't wasting my time.
{0:29:25 - 0:29:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:29:25 - 0:29:29} {DIALOGUE}: Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage?
{0:29:25 - 0:29:29} {DIALOGUE}: Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
{0:29:25 - 0:29:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:29:25 - 0:29:29} {DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{0:29:25 - 0:29:29} {DIALOGUE}: Next time I'll have to check.
{0:29:25 - 0:29:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:29:27 - 0:29:29} {DIALOGUE}: Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he?
{0:29:29 - 0:29:32} {DIALOGUE}: Apparently he likes you.
{0:29:29 - 0:29:32} {DIALOGUE}: And you like him, too.
{0:29:29 - 0:29:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:29:33 - 0:29:34} {DIALOGUE}: I never thought about it.
{0:29:33 - 0:29:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:29:33 - 0:29:38} {DIALOGUE}: Your first lie to me, Clarice.
{0:29:33 - 0:29:38} {DIALOGUE}: How sad.
{0:29:35 - 0:29:38} {DIALOGUE}: Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually?
{0:29:39 - 0:29:43} {DIALOGUE}: True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...?
{0:29:43 - 0:29:44} {DIALOGUE}: Fucking you?
{0:29:43 - 0:29:49} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:29:47 - 0:29:49} {DIALOGUE}: That doesn't interest me, Doctor.
{0:29:49 - 0:29:52} {DIALOGUE}: And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
{0:29:49 - 0:29:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:29:54 - 0:29:56} {DIALOGUE}: Not anymore.
{0:29:54 - 0:30:15} {META_DATA}: (beat)
{0:29:54 - 0:30:15} {DIALOGUE}: Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice.
{0:29:54 - 0:30:15} {DIALOGUE}: Crawford dangles you before me.
{0:29:54 - 0:30:15} {DIALOGUE}: Then I give you a bit of help.
{0:29:54 - 0:30:15} {DIALOGUE}: Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?
{0:29:54 - 0:30:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:29:54 - 0:30:15} {DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{0:29:54 - 0:30:15} {DIALOGUE}: Is it?
{0:29:54 - 0:30:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:29:54 - 0:30:15} {DIALOGUE}: Or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of... negotiation?
{0:29:54 - 0:30:15} {DIALOGUE}: There's something Crawford can give me, and I want to trade for it.
{0:29:54 - 0:30:15} {DIALOGUE}: I even wrote to him, offering my help.
{0:29:54 - 0:30:15} {DIALOGUE}: But he hates me, so he won't deal directly.
{0:29:54 - 0:30:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dr. Lecter slowly turns up the rheostat in his cell.
{0:29:54 - 0:30:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As his lights rise, we see that the cell's been stripped bare.
{0:29:54 - 0:30:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gone are his books, drawings, mattress - even his toilet seat.
{0:29:54 - 0:30:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She stands, too, startled.
{0:29:54 - 0:30:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They face each other.
{0:29:54 - 0:30:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:30:13 - 0:30:15} {DIALOGUE}: Punishment, you see.
{0:30:13 - 0:30:17} {DIALOGUE}: For Miggs.
{0:30:15 - 0:30:17} {DIALOGUE}: Just like that gospel program.
{0:30:17 - 0:30:20} {DIALOGUE}: When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up.
{0:30:20 - 0:30:24} {DIALOGUE}: Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
{0:30:20 - 0:30:39} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:30:20 - 0:30:39} {DIALOGUE}: Who killed Raspail, Doctor...?
{0:30:20 - 0:30:39} {DIALOGUE}: You know, don't you?
{0:30:20 - 0:30:39} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{0:30:36 - 0:30:39} {DIALOGUE}: I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice.
{0:30:40 - 0:30:43} {DIALOGUE}: I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive.
{0:30:44 - 0:30:46} {DIALOGUE}: What I want is a view.
{0:30:46 - 0:30:50} {DIALOGUE}: I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water.
{0:30:50 - 0:30:54} {DIALOGUE}: I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view.
{0:30:50 - 0:31:2} {DIALOGUE}: I'll give good value for it.
{0:30:50 - 0:31:2} {DIALOGUE}: Crawford could do that for me, but he won't.
{0:30:50 - 0:31:2} {DIALOGUE}: You persuade him.
{0:30:50 - 0:31:2} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{0:30:50 - 0:31:2} {META_DATA}: (almost a whisper)
{0:30:50 - 0:31:2} {DIALOGUE}: Who killed your patient?

{0:37:16 - 0:37:19} {DIALOGUE}: What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control.
{0:37:16 - 0:37:19} {DIALOGUE}: He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.

{0:37:36 - 0:37:43} {DIALOGUE}: Maybe there's a connection, maybe not.
{0:37:36 - 0:37:43} {DIALOGUE}: Lying and breathing are the same thing to Lecter.
{0:37:36 - 0:37:43} {DIALOGUE}: Number Two.
{0:37:36 - 0:37:43} {DIALOGUE}: If I'd sent you in there with something to hide from him, he'd have known it, instantly.

{0:37:36 - 0:37:43} {DIALOGUE}: If Lecter is becoming part of this case, you've got the most current read on him.
{0:37:36 - 0:37:43} {DIALOGUE}: And Number Four - you don't have to like me, or the way I do things.
{0:37:36 - 0:37:43} {DIALOGUE}: But you do have to keep a cool head.
{0:37:36 - 0:37:43} {DIALOGUE}: Especially now... Because from here on out, you'll know everything I do.
{0:37:36 - 0:37:43} {DIALOGUE}: Are we straight on that?
{0:37:36 - 0:37:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice nods, silently; it's as close to an apology as she's likely to get.

{0:37:36 - 0:37:43} {DIALOGUE}: You think about him long enough, you get a feel for him... Then, if you're lucky, out of all the stuff you know, one little part of it tugs at you, tries to get your attention... You let me know when that happens, Starling.
{0:37:36 - 0:37:43} {DIALOGUE}: Live right behind your eyes, today.
{0:37:36 - 0:37:43} {DIALOGUE}: Don't try to impose any patterns on this guy.

{0:58:30 - 0:59:35} {DIALOGUE}: Among those who tried to conceal their past, look for severe childhood disturbances, associated with violence... Possibly you'll find a childhood incarceration... Then go to their personality tests...
{0:58:30 - 0:59:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We pass a row of female mannequins, some nude, some wearing colorful leather jackets, designer knockoffs, in various stages of completion... then a huge maroon armoire, in Chinese lacquer; its double doors are slightly ajar... The jaunty background.

{0:58:30 - 0:59:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And now we hear something else, too - the rapid CLICKING of a sewing machine...
{0:58:30 - 0:59:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER (V.O.)
{0:58:30 - 0:59:35} {DIALOGUE}: Study their drawings, especially.

{0:58:30 - 0:59:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We TURN another corner, and there is Mr. Gumb himself.
{0:58:30 - 0:59:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As we APPROACH, his wide back is to us; he's hunched over an old- fashioned sewing machine, humming cheerfully, and working a piece of material that we mercifully cannot see.

{0:58:30 - 0:59:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He wears a hairnet and a beautiful kimono, and pumps the treadle with his bare feet.

{0:58:30 - 0:59:35} {DIALOGUE}: Billy hates his own identity, he always has - and he thinks that makes him a transsexual.

{0:58:30 - 0:59:35} {DIALOGUE}: He will be reborn...
{0:58:30 - 0:59:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At the end of this final corridor, the cellar widens into a low-ceilinged chamber, with two additional doorways, and in the center of this is the gaping circle of the oubliette.

{1:0:38 - 1:0:55} {DIALOGUE}: And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation.
{1:0:38 - 1:0:55} {DIALOGUE}: And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.

{1:7:5 - 1:7:21} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{1:7:19 - 1:7:21} {DIALOGUE}: How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?

{1:7:48 - 1:8:9} {DIALOGUE}: You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?
{1:7:48 - 1:8:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER

{1:8:58 - 1:9:0} {DIALOGUE}: That's his nature.
{1:9:0 - 1:9:3} {DIALOGUE}: And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?
{1:9:3 - 1:9:6} {DIALOGUE}: Do we seek out things to covet?

{1:9:26 - 1:9:30} {DIALOGUE}: It's your turn to tell me, Clarice.
{1:9:30 - 1:9:33} {DIALOGUE}: You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island.

{1:10:3 - 1:10:5} {DIALOGUE}: And - one morning I just - ran away...

{1:10:3 - 1:10:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{1:10:6 - 1:10:9} {DIALOGUE}: Not "just," Clarice.
{1:10:6 - 1:10:9} {DIALOGUE}: What set you off?

{1:11:11 - 1:11:13} {DIALOGUE}: First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run.
{1:11:13 - 1:11:16} {DIALOGUE}: They just stood there, confused.

{1:11:13 - 1:11:20} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{1:11:17 - 1:11:20} {DIALOGUE}: But you could.

{1:13:25 - 1:14:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as the exchange is made, his index finger touches her hand, and lingers there, just for a moment.
{1:13:25 - 1:14:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: DR. LECTER'S EYES

{1:46:10 - 1:50:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: with NORMAL SPEED RESTORED, as the side of her face hits the floor, and she is gasping, stunned by the noise and flames; there is blood on her check, and an ugly powder burn, but she ignores them, twisting to yank her speedloader from her jacket pocket, locking it blindly onto her gun's cylinder, reloading, right in front of her face, then rolling onto her stomach, aiming her gun upward again, blinking her dazzled eyes, straining to locate him in the darkness... Where is he, where...?
