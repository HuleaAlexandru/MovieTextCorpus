{0:21:51 - 0:22:11} {DIALOGUE}: And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile.
{0:21:51 - 0:22:11} {DIALOGUE}: OUT OF LOVE.
{0:21:51 - 0:22:11} {DIALOGUE}: And see how Admiral Kirk requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth!

{0:22:31 - 0:22:48} {META_DATA}: (continuing)
{0:22:44 - 0:22:48} {DIALOGUE}: Let me introduce you to Ceti Alpha V's only remaining indigenous life form; what do you think?
{0:23:7 - 0:23:9} {DIALOGUE}: They've killed twenty of my people, including my beloved wife.
{0:23:24 - 0:23:27} {DIALOGUE}: Oh, not all at once and not instantly, to be sure.
{0:23:50 - 0:23:53} {DIALOGUE}: Their young enter through the ears and wrap themselves around the cerebral cortex.
{0:23:53 - 0:23:57} {DIALOGUE}: This has the effect of rendering the victim extremely susceptible to suggestion.
{0:24:3 - 0:24:8} {DIALOGUE}: Later, as they grow, follows madness, paralysis -- and death.

{0:24:3 - 0:24:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he speaks, Khan dumps an eel in each of their helmets; he swirls the helmets around as though he were mixing martinis --
{0:24:3 - 0:24:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CHEKOV
{0:24:22 - 0:24:24} {DIALOGUE}: Khan, listen to me!

{0:24:37 - 0:25:10} {DIALOGUE}: That was what I learned from watching my wife.
{0:24:37 - 0:25:10} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At a sign, the helmets are slammed down.
{0:24:37 - 0:25:10} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the muffled shrieks are heard from within, the eels crawl across the faces of Chekov and Terrell; with unerring in- stincts they head for the ears of the two hapless men.
{0:24:37 - 0:25:10} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is some atrocious pain as they enter -- then dazed calm.
