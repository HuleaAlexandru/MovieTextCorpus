{2:31:17 - 2:41:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSSELL (cont'd)
{2:31:17 - 2:41:29} {DIALOGUE}: -- we told him too much, we told him everything... He almost died with us over Tupelo... if the band survives him, it'll be a miracle... but you know, he tried to keep up, and that's a journalist to me.
{2:31:17 - 2:41:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JANN
{2:31:17 - 2:41:29} {DIALOGUE}: It's too late.

{2:31:17 - 2:41:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But Russell looks around at the numerous portraits if dead legendary rock stars, fixing on the one photo closest to all of them, a very vulnerable-looking Janis Joplin.
{2:31:17 - 2:41:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A second thought.
{2:31:17 - 2:41:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSSELL (cont'd)
{2:31:17 - 2:41:29} {DIALOGUE}: You tell me it's too late.
{2:31:17 - 2:41:29} {DIALOGUE}: But I could go back to my hotel room and... and O.D. tonight and something tells me you'd find a way to put me on the cover of the next issue.
{2:31:17 - 2:41:29} {DIALOGUE}: Am I right?
{2:31:17 - 2:41:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks at their faces.

{2:31:17 - 2:41:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSSELL (cont'd)
{2:31:17 - 2:41:29} {DIALOGUE}: I'm learning the game.
{2:31:17 - 2:41:29} {META_DATA}: (beat, shrug)
{2:31:17 - 2:41:29} {DIALOGUE}: We fucked up.

{2:31:17 - 2:41:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{2:31:17 - 2:41:29} {DIALOGUE}: Next time we'll all be more professional.
{2:31:17 - 2:41:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSSELL
{2:31:17 - 2:41:29} {DIALOGUE}: Maybe so.
{2:31:17 - 2:41:29} {META_DATA}: (beat, an odd thought)
