{0:0:0 - 0:0:58} {META_DATA}: Final Production Draft
{0:0:0 - 0:0:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is a Southern story, full of lies and fabrications, but truer for their inclusion.

{0:0:0 - 0:0:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is The Beast.
{0:0:0 - 0:0:58} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{0:0:55 - 0:0:58} {DIALOGUE}: There are some fish that cannot be caught.
{0:1:0 - 0:1:3} {DIALOGUE}: It's not that they're faster or stronger than other fish.
{0:1:4 - 0:1:7} {DIALOGUE}: They're just touched by something extra.
{0:1:4 - 0:1:11} {DIALOGUE}: Call it luck.
{0:1:4 - 0:1:11} {DIALOGUE}: Call it grace.
{0:1:8 - 0:1:11} {DIALOGUE}: One such fish was The Beast.
{0:1:8 - 0:1:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Beast's journey takes it past a dangling fish hook, baited with worms.
{0:1:8 - 0:1:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Past a tempting lure, sparkling in the sun.
{0:1:8 - 0:1:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Past a swiping bear claw.
{0:1:8 - 0:1:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Beast isn't worried.
{0:1:8 - 0:1:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{0:1:12 - 0:1:16} {DIALOGUE}: By the time I was born, he was already a legend.
{0:1:17 - 0:1:21} {DIALOGUE}: He'd taken more hundred- dollar lures than any fish in Alabama.
{0:1:26 - 0:1:29} {DIALOGUE}: Some said that fish was the ghost of Henry Walls, a thief who'd drowned in that river 60 years before.
{0:1:30 - 0:1:35} {DIALOGUE}: Others claimed he was a lesser dinosaur, left over from the Cretaceous period.
{0:1:30 - 0:1:39} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (1973)
{0:1:30 - 0:1:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WILL BLOOM, AGE 3, listens wide-eyed as his father EDWARD BLOOM, 40's and handsome, tells the story.
{0:1:30 - 0:1:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In every gesture, Edward is bigger than life, describing each detail with absolute conviction.
{0:1:30 - 0:1:39} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:1:35 - 0:1:39} {DIALOGUE}: I didn't put any stock into such speculation or superstition.
{0:1:39 - 0:1:42} {DIALOGUE}: All I knew was I'd been trying to catch that fish since I was a boy no bigger than you.
{0:1:39 - 0:1:51} {META_DATA}: (closer)
{0:1:48 - 0:1:51} {DIALOGUE}: And on the day you were born, that was the day I finally caught him.
{0:1:48 - 0:1:58} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT (1977)
{0:1:48 - 0:1:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A few years later, and Will sits with the other INDIAN GUIDES as Edward continues telling the story to the tribe.
{0:1:48 - 0:1:58} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:1:55 - 0:1:58} {DIALOGUE}: Now, I'd tried everything on it: worms, lures, peanut butter, peanut butter-and-cheese.
{0:2:1 - 0:2:6} {DIALOGUE}: But on that day I had a revelation: if that fish was the ghost of a thief, the usual bait wasn't going to work.
{0:2:6 - 0:2:11} {DIALOGUE}: I would have to use something he truly desired.
{0:2:6 - 0:2:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward points to his wedding band, glinting in the firelight.
{0:2:6 - 0:2:14} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LITTLE BRAVE
{0:2:6 - 0:2:14} {META_DATA}: (confused)
{0:2:12 - 0:2:14} {DIALOGUE}: Your finger?
{0:2:12 - 0:2:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward slips his ring off.
{0:2:12 - 0:2:14} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:2:12 - 0:2:14} {DIALOGUE}: Gold.
{0:2:12 - 0:2:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: While the other boys are rapt with attention, Will looks bored.
{0:2:12 - 0:2:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's heard this story before.
{0:2:12 - 0:2:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:2:18 - 0:2:23} {DIALOGUE}: I tied my ring to the strongest line they made -- strong enough to hold up a bridge, they said, if just for a few minutes -- and I cast upriver.
{0:2:18 - 0:2:34} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. BLOOM FRONT HALL - NIGHT (1987)
{0:2:18 - 0:2:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward is chatting up Will's pretty DATE to the homecoming dance.
{0:2:18 - 0:2:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She is enjoying the story, but also the force of Edward's charisma.
{0:2:18 - 0:2:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's hypnotizing.
{0:2:18 - 0:2:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (CONT'D)
{0:2:29 - 0:2:34} {DIALOGUE}: The Beast jumped up and grabbed it before the ring even hit the water.
{0:2:34 - 0:2:39} {DIALOGUE}: And just as fast, he snapped clean through that line.
{0:2:34 - 0:2:40} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WILL, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave.
{0:2:34 - 0:2:40} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His mother SANDRA -- from whom he gets his good looks and practicality -- stands with him at the door.
{0:2:34 - 0:2:40} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:2:39 - 0:2:40} {DIALOGUE}: You can see my predicament.
{0:2:41 - 0:2:45} {DIALOGUE}: My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
{0:2:41 - 0:2:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ON WILL AND SANDRA
{0:2:41 - 0:2:47} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{0:2:41 - 0:2:47} {META_DATA}: (low but insistent)
{0:2:45 - 0:2:47} {DIALOGUE}: Make him stop.
{0:2:45 - 0:2:52} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His mother pats him sympathetically, then adjusts his tie.
{0:2:45 - 0:2:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL'S DATE
{0:2:51 - 0:2:52} {DIALOGUE}: What did you do?
{0:2:51 - 0:3:0} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:2:51 - 0:3:0} {DIALOGUE}: I followed that fish up-river and down-river for three days and three nights, until I finally had him boxed in.
{0:2:51 - 0:3:0} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will regards his father with exasperated contempt.
{0:2:51 - 0:3:0} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:2:51 - 0:3:0} {DIALOGUE}: With these two hands, I reached in and snatched that fish out of the river.
{0:2:51 - 0:3:0} {DIALOGUE}: I looked him straight in the eye.
{0:2:51 - 0:3:0} {DIALOGUE}: And I made a remarkable discovery.
{0:2:51 - 0:3:0} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. TINY PARIS RESTAURANT (LA RUE 14°) - NIGHT (1998)
{0:2:51 - 0:3:0} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WILL, now 28, sits with his gorgeous bride JOSEPHINE.
{0:2:51 - 0:3:0} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is their wedding reception, crowded with their friends and family.
{0:2:51 - 0:3:0} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They should be joyful, but Will is furious.
{0:2:51 - 0:3:0} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward has the floor, ostensibly for a toast.
{0:2:51 - 0:3:0} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The room is cozy and drunk.
{0:2:51 - 0:3:0} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:2:58 - 0:3:0} {DIALOGUE}: This fish, the Beast.
{0:3:0 - 0:3:6} {DIALOGUE}: The whole time we were calling it a him, when in fact it was a her.
{0:3:6 - 0:3:9} {DIALOGUE}: It was fat with eggs, and was going to lay them any day.
{0:3:6 - 0:3:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Over near the doorway, we spot Sandra, just returned from the restrooms.
{0:3:6 - 0:3:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She looks gorgeous.
{0:3:6 - 0:3:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She couldn't be any happier if this were her own wedding.
{0:3:6 - 0:3:11} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:3:9 - 0:3:11} {DIALOGUE}: Now, I was in a situation.
{0:3:9 - 0:3:23} {DIALOGUE}: I could gut that fish and get my ring back, but doing so I would be killing the smartest catfish in the Ashton River, soon to be mother of a hundred others.
{0:3:9 - 0:3:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will can't take any more.
{0:3:9 - 0:3:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Josephine tries to hold him back, but he gets up and leaves.
{0:3:9 - 0:3:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward doesn't even notice.
{0:3:9 - 0:3:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:3:21 - 0:3:23} {DIALOGUE}: Did I want to deprive my soon-to-be- born son the chance to catch a fish like this of his own?
{0:3:29 - 0:3:34} {DIALOGUE}: This lady fish and I, well, we had the same destiny.
{0:3:29 - 0:3:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he leaves, Will mutters in perfect unison with his father --
{0:3:29 - 0:3:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD AND WILL
{0:3:29 - 0:3:34} {DIALOGUE}: We were part of the same equation.
{0:3:29 - 0:3:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will reaches the door, where his mother intercepts him.
{0:3:29 - 0:3:41} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{0:3:37 - 0:3:41} {DIALOGUE}: Honey, it's still your night.
{0:3:37 - 0:3:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will can't articulate his anger.
{0:3:37 - 0:3:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He just leaves.
{0:3:37 - 0:3:47} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:3:41 - 0:3:47} {DIALOGUE}: Now, you may well ask, since this lady fish wasn't the ghost of a thief, why did it strike so quick on gold when nothing else would attract it?
{0:3:41 - 0:3:50} {META_DATA}: (closer; he holds up his ring)
{0:3:47 - 0:3:50} {DIALOGUE}: That was the lesson I learned that day, the day my son was born.
{0:3:47 - 0:4:0} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He focuses his words on Sandra.
{0:3:47 - 0:4:0} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This story is -- and has always been -- about her more than anyone.
{0:3:47 - 0:4:0} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:3:54 - 0:4:0} {DIALOGUE}: Sometimes, the only way to catch an uncatchable woman is to offer her a wedding ring.
{0:3:54 - 0:4:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A LAUGH from the crowd.
{0:3:54 - 0:4:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward motions for Sandra to get up here with him.
{0:3:54 - 0:4:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As she crosses, we can see that thirty years of marriage has not lessened their affection for each other.
{0:3:54 - 0:4:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As they kiss, Edward tweaks her chin a special little way.
{0:3:54 - 0:4:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crowd APPLAUDS.
{0:3:54 - 0:4:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward toasts the happy couple.
{0:3:54 - 0:4:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Josephine covers well for her absent husband, a smile as warm as summer.

{0:3:54 - 0:4:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Occasional PASSERSBY take notice, especially as it gets more heated.
{0:3:54 - 0:4:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Both men are a little drunk.
{0:3:54 - 0:4:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:4:12 - 0:4:15} {DIALOGUE}: What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
{0:4:12 - 0:4:17} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{0:4:12 - 0:4:17} {META_DATA}: (disbelieving)
{0:4:15 - 0:4:17} {DIALOGUE}: I am a footnote in that story.
{0:4:15 - 0:4:23} {DIALOGUE}: I am the context for your great adventure.
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {DIALOGUE}: Which never happened!
{0:4:17 - 0:4:26} {DIALOGUE}: Incidentally!
{0:4:23 - 0:4:26} {DIALOGUE}: You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
{0:4:23 - 0:4:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:4:23 - 0:4:29} {META_DATA}: (shaking his head)
{0:4:23 - 0:4:29} {DIALOGUE}: Jesus Christ.
{0:4:23 - 0:4:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{0:4:23 - 0:4:29} {DIALOGUE}: Friend of yours?
{0:4:23 - 0:4:29} {DIALOGUE}: Did you help him out of a bind?
{0:4:23 - 0:4:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:4:26 - 0:4:29} {DIALOGUE}: Come on, Will.
{0:4:26 - 0:4:29} {DIALOGUE}: Everyone likes that story.
{0:4:26 - 0:4:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{0:4:26 - 0:4:33} {DIALOGUE}: No Dad, they don't.
{0:4:26 - 0:4:33} {DIALOGUE}: I do not like the story.
{0:4:29 - 0:4:33} {DIALOGUE}: Not anymore, not after a thousand times.
{0:4:29 - 0:4:37} {DIALOGUE}: I know all the punchlines, Dad.
{0:4:33 - 0:4:37} {DIALOGUE}: I can tell them as well as you can.
{0:4:33 - 0:4:41} {META_DATA}: (closer)
{0:4:38 - 0:4:41} {DIALOGUE}: For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom.
{0:4:38 - 0:4:49} {DIALOGUE}: It revolves around me and my wife.
{0:4:44 - 0:4:49} {DIALOGUE}: How can you not understand that?
{0:4:44 - 0:4:49} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A long beat, then...
{0:4:44 - 0:4:49} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:4:44 - 0:4:49} {META_DATA}: (low)
{0:4:44 - 0:4:49} {DIALOGUE}: Sorry to embarrass you.
{0:4:44 - 0:4:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will won't let him get the last word.
{0:4:44 - 0:4:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{0:4:49 - 0:4:53} {DIALOGUE}: You're embarrassing yourself, Dad.
{0:4:49 - 0:4:53} {DIALOGUE}: You just don't see it.
{0:4:49 - 0:4:59} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ANGLE ON Edward.
{0:4:49 - 0:4:59} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Fine.
{0:4:49 - 0:4:59} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A hand to wave, enough of you.
{0:4:49 - 0:4:59} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He walks away.
{0:4:49 - 0:4:59} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ANGLE ON Will, still fuming with righteous anger.
{0:4:49 - 0:4:59} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's then we FREEZE FRAME.
{0:4:49 - 0:4:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL (V.O.)

{0:5:4 - 0:5:8} {DIALOGUE}: William Bloom with the Associated Press if I could just...
{0:5:4 - 0:5:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's put back on hold.
{0:5:4 - 0:5:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Returning to the mail, he finds a hand-addressed envelope.
{0:5:4 - 0:5:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Rips it open.
{0:5:4 - 0:5:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL (V.O.)
{0:5:12 - 0:5:15} {DIALOGUE}: We communicated indirectly I guess.
{0:5:15 - 0:5:19} {DIALOGUE}: In her letters and Christmas cards, my mother would write for both of them.
{0:5:15 - 0:5:24} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. BLOOM HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY
{0:5:15 - 0:5:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At the table, Sandra talks on the phone while Edward fixes a sandwich.
{0:5:15 - 0:5:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL (V.O.)
{0:5:15 - 0:5:24} {DIALOGUE}: When I'd call, Mom would say that Dad was out driving.
{0:5:19 - 0:5:24} {DIALOGUE}: Or swimming in the pool.
{0:5:19 - 0:5:27} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward takes a seat, starting to eat his sandwich.
{0:5:19 - 0:5:27} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL

{0:5:24 - 0:5:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL (V.O.)
{0:5:30 - 0:5:34} {DIALOGUE}: The truth is, I didn't see anything of myself in my father, and I don't think he saw anything of himself in me.
{0:5:41 - 0:5:46} {DIALOGUE}: We were like strangers who knew each other very well.
{0:5:41 - 0:5:57} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. RIVER - DAY
{0:5:41 - 0:5:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward stares intently into the water, a lion in wait.
{0:5:41 - 0:5:57} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL (V.O.)
{0:5:52 - 0:5:57} {DIALOGUE}: In telling the story of my father's life, it's impossible to separate the fact from the fiction, the man from the myth.
{0:6:0 - 0:6:3} {DIALOGUE}: The best I can do is to tell it the way he told me.
{0:6:0 - 0:6:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We LOOK DOWN at the river, where Edward's reflection is caught in the dark water.
{0:6:0 - 0:6:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the water ripples past, something changes.
{0:6:0 - 0:6:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sure enough, as we LOOK UP again, it's a younger EDWARD BLOOM, 20's, staring into the water.
{0:6:0 - 0:6:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's not just handsome, not just charming.
{0:6:0 - 0:6:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's as if all the forces of the natural world had conspired to create him.
{0:6:0 - 0:6:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL (V.O.)
{0:6:5 - 0:6:9} {DIALOGUE}: It doesn't always make sense, and most of it never happened.
{0:6:5 - 0:6:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, this Edward thrusts both hands into the water, grabbing hold of
{0:6:5 - 0:6:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE BEAST.
{0:6:5 - 0:6:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He brings the catfish up to his face.
{0:6:5 - 0:6:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Looks it right in the eye.
{0:6:5 - 0:6:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat, then the Beast spits out Edward's gold ring.
{0:6:5 - 0:6:54} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL (V.O.)
{0:6:51 - 0:6:54} {DIALOGUE}: But that's what kind of story this is.
{0:6:51 - 0:7:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Smiling, Edward takes the ring, then throws the Beast back into the water with a splash.
{0:6:51 - 0:7:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: TITLE OVER:

{0:6:51 - 0:7:6} {DIALOGUE}: Now, Mrs. Bloom, I'll need you to give me one good push.
{0:6:51 - 0:7:6} {DIALOGUE}: On three.
{0:6:51 - 0:7:6} {DIALOGUE}: One...
{0:6:51 - 0:7:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, we hear a POP as a slimy mass of human being rockets into the doctor's unprepared hands.
{0:6:51 - 0:7:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bennett tries to hold tight, but the infant is slippery like a fish.
{0:6:51 - 0:7:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It shoots up into air.
{0:6:51 - 0:7:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The NURSES and the Husband try to grab the baby, but no one can hold it.
{0:6:51 - 0:7:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the newborn sails upward TOWARDS CAMERA, we can see a GIGGLING SMILE on its face.
{0:6:51 - 0:7:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As it falls, the newborn knocks over a tray, which provides it a ramp to slide right out of the room.
{0:6:51 - 0:7:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everyone races after it.
{0:6:51 - 0:7:6} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

{0:7:3 - 0:7:6} {DIALOGUE}: My father's birth would set the pace for his unlikely life.
{0:7:7 - 0:7:10} {DIALOGUE}: No longer than most men's, but larger.
{0:7:12 - 0:7:15} {DIALOGUE}: And as strange as his stories got, the endings were always the most surprising of all.
{0:7:12 - 0:7:45} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. HALF-DARK PARIS APARTMENT - (PRESENT) DAY
{0:7:12 - 0:7:45} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Over the sound of rain, a phone RINGS on a chair.
{0:7:12 - 0:7:45} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: By the tone of the ring, we know we're not in the U.S. -- it has that insistent European sound.
{0:7:12 - 0:7:45} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As it keeps RINGING, we look to see the apartment is mostly empty, just a few half-unpacked boxes.
{0:7:12 - 0:7:45} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A cradle is still in its carton.

{0:15:59 - 0:16:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:16:3 - 0:16:5} {DIALOGUE}: No, but I hear it's terrible.

{0:24:47 - 0:24:51} {DIALOGUE}: I'm a human sacrifice.
{0:24:52 - 0:24:53} {DIALOGUE}: If I go back, everyone will think I'm a coward.

{0:25:6 - 0:25:10} {DIALOGUE}: It's just I get so hungry.
{0:25:6 - 0:25:10} {DIALOGUE}: I'm too big.
{0:25:6 - 0:25:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And that's the sad truth.
{0:25:6 - 0:25:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Karl is less a monster than a freak -- a giant man, but in the end, just a man.

{0:25:15 - 0:25:17} {DIALOGUE}: Maybe this town's just too small.

{0:25:27 - 0:25:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KARL

{0:25:55 - 0:26:1} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KARL
{0:25:55 - 0:26:1} {DIALOGUE}: You don't like it?

{0:25:55 - 0:26:1} {DIALOGUE}: I love every square inch of it.
{0:25:55 - 0:26:1} {DIALOGUE}: But I can feel the edges closing in on me.
{0:25:55 - 0:26:1} {DIALOGUE}: A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.
{0:25:55 - 0:26:1} {META_DATA}: (beat)
{0:25:58 - 0:26:1} {DIALOGUE}: So what do you say?

{0:26:37 - 0:26:58} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)

{0:27:5 - 0:27:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE OLD WOMAN.
{0:27:5 - 0:27:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been cast.
{0:27:5 - 0:27:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She motions for Edward to lean down, so she can whisper something to him.
{0:27:5 - 0:27:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Although we're VERY CLOSE, we can't hear her voice.
{0:27:5 - 0:27:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{0:27:13 - 0:27:16} {DIALOGUE}: She said that the biggest fish in the river gets that way by never being caught.
{0:27:13 - 0:27:27} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The advice only succeeds in confusing Edward.
{0:27:13 - 0:27:27} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD

{0:27:13 - 0:27:27} {DIALOGUE}: Okay.

{0:27:24 - 0:27:44} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{0:27:42 - 0:27:44} {DIALOGUE}: There were two roads out of Ashton, a new one which was paved, and an older one that wasn't.
{0:27:46 - 0:27:49} {DIALOGUE}: People didn't use the old road anymore, and it had developed the reputation of being haunted.
{0:27:46 - 0:27:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward and Karl come to a bend, where the paved road veers left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight.
{0:27:46 - 0:27:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The old road is blocked with signs and warnings of danger.
{0:27:46 - 0:27:57} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{0:27:53 - 0:27:57} {DIALOGUE}: Since I had no intention of ever returning to Ashton, this seemed as good a time as any to find out what lay down that old road.

{0:27:53 - 0:28:2} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KARL

{0:28:2 - 0:28:5} {DIALOGUE}: He was going to Paris, France.
{0:28:5 - 0:28:8} {DIALOGUE}: He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.
{0:28:5 - 0:28:11} {META_DATA}: (beat)
{0:28:9 - 0:28:11} {DIALOGUE}: Tell you what.
{0:28:9 - 0:28:14} {DIALOGUE}: You take the other way and I'll cut through here.
{0:28:11 - 0:28:14} {DIALOGUE}: Meet you on the far side.

{0:28:11 - 0:28:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KARL

{0:28:16 - 0:28:26} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD

{0:28:23 - 0:29:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spikes of sunlight break through the thick canopy, catching particles in the air.
{0:28:23 - 0:29:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Still, Edward WHISTLES.
{0:28:23 - 0:29:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coming around a bend, his PITCH DROPS as he sees thick, thorny vines growing across the path.
{0:28:23 - 0:29:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stops.
{0:28:23 - 0:29:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For the first time, he realizes the birds have stopped singing.
{0:28:23 - 0:29:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The forest is dead quiet.
{0:28:23 - 0:29:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks back the way he came.
{0:28:23 - 0:29:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's tempting to go back.
{0:28:23 - 0:29:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It would be easier to go back.
{0:28:23 - 0:29:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But Edward presses on.
{0:28:23 - 0:29:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He carefully steps through the thorns.
{0:28:23 - 0:29:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His trouser legs catch on the barbs.
{0:28:23 - 0:29:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We can hear the fabric TEAR.
{0:28:23 - 0:29:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: FURTHER ALONG
{0:28:23 - 0:29:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A scratched and sweaty Edward waves off various STINGING BUGS flying at him, finally whipping off his hat to swat at them.
{0:28:23 - 0:29:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just then a CAWING crow swoops down and grabs the hat right out of his hands.
{0:28:23 - 0:29:41} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD

{0:28:23 - 0:29:41} {META_DATA}: JUMPING SPIDERS!
{0:28:23 - 0:29:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sure enough, up ahead he sees the path is overgrown with thick cobwebs, heavy from the rain.
{0:28:23 - 0:29:41} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{0:29:36 - 0:29:41} {DIALOGUE}: There comes a point where a reasonable man will swallow his pride and admit he's made a terrible mistake.
{0:29:41 - 0:29:46} {DIALOGUE}: The truth is, I was never a reasonable man.
{0:29:41 - 0:29:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward tosses the sign and forges ahead, into the spiderwebs.
{0:29:41 - 0:29:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD

{0:29:50 - 0:30:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty and comforting.
{0:29:50 - 0:30:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ahead lies a tiny one-street town -- smaller even than Ashton -- with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it.
{0:29:50 - 0:30:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dangling from the line above he sees two dozen pairs of shoes, their laces tied together.

{0:41:29 - 0:41:33} {DIALOGUE}: It was incredible.
{0:41:29 - 0:41:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{0:41:33 - 0:41:37} {DIALOGUE}: We'll have to pick up a copy.
{0:41:33 - 0:41:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.

{0:41:33 - 0:41:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:41:52 - 0:41:56} {DIALOGUE}: I don't know if you're aware of this, Josephine, but African parrots, in their native home of the Congo -- they speak only French.
{0:41:52 - 0:41:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All three stop to listen.
{0:41:52 - 0:41:58} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPHINE
{0:41:52 - 0:41:58} {META_DATA}: (amused)

{0:41:57 - 0:42:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:41:59 - 0:42:3} {DIALOGUE}: You're lucky to get four words out of them in English.
{0:42:6 - 0:42:10} {DIALOGUE}: But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French.
{0:42:10 - 0:42:15} {DIALOGUE}: Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
{0:42:10 - 0:42:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Taking the bait...
{0:42:10 - 0:42:21} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{0:42:19 - 0:42:21} {DIALOGUE}: Why not religion, Dad?
{0:42:19 - 0:42:26} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:42:21 - 0:42:26} {DIALOGUE}: It's rude to talk about religion.

{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA

{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: How is that possible?
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {META_DATA}: (decidedly)
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: You can't honestly say you know him.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: Yes, Will, I do.

{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: No it's not.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: It's exactly the same.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: Your father and I met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: Just the same as you two.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She moves on to the carrots.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL

{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {META_DATA}: (beat)
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: You can't discount that.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: True.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: Or ever will.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With a look, Sandra acknowledges the stakes.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: I know it's not easy.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: You just ended up together.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: But I understand you, Mom.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: I always have.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: Well, clearly you don't.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.

{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's hard to read her reaction: does she recognize him, or just find him attractive?

{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The woman turns away.
{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will racks his brain -- does he know this woman?

{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {DIALOGUE}: But it's weird.

{0:42:36 - 0:42:56} {META_DATA}: (to the cashier)

{0:43:4 - 0:43:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:43:10 - 0:43:15} {DIALOGUE}: I don't usually remember unless they're especially portentous.

{0:43:15 - 0:43:33} {DIALOGUE}: Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die."
{0:43:30 - 0:43:33} {DIALOGUE}: I was so scared I woke up my parents.
{0:43:33 - 0:43:38} {DIALOGUE}: They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed.
{0:43:38 - 0:43:41} {DIALOGUE}: But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
{0:43:38 - 0:43:44} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPHINE
{0:43:42 - 0:43:44} {DIALOGUE}: That's terrible.
{0:43:42 - 0:43:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:43:44 - 0:43:50} {DIALOGUE}: Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power.
{0:43:50 - 0:43:55} {DIALOGUE}: Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "Your Grampa is going to die."
{0:43:50 - 0:44:2} {DIALOGUE}: Well, I ran right back to my parents.
{0:43:50 - 0:44:2} {DIALOGUE}: My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation.
{0:43:50 - 0:44:2} {DIALOGUE}: And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead.

{0:43:50 - 0:44:2} {META_DATA}: (beat)
{0:44:1 - 0:44:2} {DIALOGUE}: Well, I didn't know what to do.
{0:44:2 - 0:44:6} {DIALOGUE}: But finally I told my father.
{0:44:6 - 0:44:12} {DIALOGUE}: And he said not to worry, but I could tell he was rattled.
{0:44:15 - 0:44:20} {DIALOGUE}: That next day, he wasn't himself, always looking around, waiting for something to drop on his head.
{0:44:20 - 0:44:25} {DIALOGUE}: Because the crow didn't tell how it was going to happen, just those words: your Daddy is going to die.
{0:44:28 - 0:44:34} {DIALOGUE}: Well, he went into town early and was gone for a long time.
{0:44:37 - 0:44:41} {DIALOGUE}: And when he finally came back, he looked terrible, like he was waiting for the axe to fall all day.
{0:44:41 - 0:44:43} {DIALOGUE}: He said to my mother, "Good God.
{0:44:43 - 0:44:47} {DIALOGUE}: I just had the worst day of my life."

{0:44:51 - 0:44:57} {DIALOGUE}: "This morning the milkman dropped dead on the porch!"
{0:44:51 - 0:45:3} {DIALOGUE}: Josephine smiles, a half-laugh, which gets him smiling too.
{0:44:51 - 0:45:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A long beat.
{0:44:51 - 0:45:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, deadpan...
{0:44:51 - 0:45:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{0:44:59 - 0:45:3} {DIALOGUE}: Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
{0:44:59 - 0:45:10} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPHINE

{1:15:18 - 1:15:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{1:15:18 - 1:15:30} {DIALOGUE}: Mmm, what.
{1:15:27 - 1:15:30} {DIALOGUE}: I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.
{1:15:27 - 1:15:33} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He moves his head out from under the sheet.
{1:15:27 - 1:15:33} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She follows him to the "outside."

{1:15:39 - 1:15:47} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{1:15:46 - 1:15:47} {DIALOGUE}: You have to understand.
{1:15:48 - 1:15:51} {DIALOGUE}: When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here.
{1:15:52 - 1:15:55} {DIALOGUE}: And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else.
{1:15:57 - 1:15:59} {DIALOGUE}: With another house, another family.
{1:16:0 - 1:16:3} {DIALOGUE}: He leaves us, he goes to them.
{1:16:7 - 1:16:11} {DIALOGUE}: Or maybe there is no family.
{1:16:7 - 1:16:11} {DIALOGUE}: Maybe he never wanted a family.
{1:16:13 - 1:16:16} {DIALOGUE}: But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better.
{1:16:17 - 1:16:20} {DIALOGUE}: And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
{1:16:17 - 1:16:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPHINE
{1:16:20 - 1:16:23} {DIALOGUE}: But it's not true.
{1:16:20 - 1:16:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{1:16:20 - 1:16:23} {DIALOGUE}: What is "true?"
{1:16:25 - 1:16:27} {DIALOGUE}: I've never heard my father say a single true thing.
{1:16:25 - 1:16:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Off her silence...
{1:16:25 - 1:16:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{1:16:33 - 1:16:35} {DIALOGUE}: Look, I know why you like him.
{1:16:36 - 1:16:39} {DIALOGUE}: I know why everyone likes him.
{1:16:39 - 1:16:42} {DIALOGUE}: But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
{1:16:39 - 1:16:45} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPHINE
{1:16:43 - 1:16:45} {DIALOGUE}: You're not.
{1:16:43 - 1:16:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL

{1:17:11 - 1:17:20} {META_DATA}: (re: Josephine)

{1:17:21 - 1:17:24} {DIALOGUE}: The tree fell on the car, spilling the syrup, which attracted the flies, which got stuck to it and flew off with the whole car.
{1:17:21 - 1:17:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{1:17:21 - 1:17:39} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{1:17:21 - 1:17:39} {META_DATA}: (undeterred)

{1:17:50 - 1:18:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Both women quickly gather plates.
{1:17:50 - 1:18:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will and Edward both smile.
{1:17:50 - 1:18:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The women clearly want this to happen.
{1:17:50 - 1:18:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It settles for a beat after they leave.
{1:17:50 - 1:18:11} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{1:18:8 - 1:18:11} {DIALOGUE}: Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
{1:18:8 - 1:18:11} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{1:18:8 - 1:18:11} {DIALOGUE}: Do I?
{1:18:11 - 1:18:13} {DIALOGUE}: I saw an iceberg once.
{1:18:17 - 1:18:21} {DIALOGUE}: They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside.
{1:18:21 - 1:18:24} {DIALOGUE}: The woolly kind.

{1:18:25 - 1:18:31} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{1:18:28 - 1:18:31} {DIALOGUE}: I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
{1:18:28 - 1:18:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{1:18:31 - 1:18:33} {DIALOGUE}: Then you shouldn't have started with a question.
{1:18:34 - 1:18:35} {DIALOGUE}: Because people want to answer questions.
{1:18:36 - 1:18:39} {DIALOGUE}: You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
{1:18:36 - 1:18:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{1:18:36 - 1:18:43} {META_DATA}: (frustrated)
{1:18:40 - 1:18:43} {DIALOGUE}: The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them.
{1:18:43 - 1:18:47} {DIALOGUE}: The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it.
{1:18:49 - 1:18:51} {DIALOGUE}: And that's what it is with you Dad.
{1:18:55 - 1:18:57} {DIALOGUE}: I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
{1:18:55 - 1:19:0} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{1:18:55 - 1:19:0} {META_DATA}: (joking)
{1:18:57 - 1:19:0} {DIALOGUE}: What, you're seeing down to my nose?

{1:18:57 - 1:19:6} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{1:19:3 - 1:19:6} {DIALOGUE}: I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
{1:19:3 - 1:19:11} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{1:19:7 - 1:19:11} {DIALOGUE}: I've told you a thousand facts.
{1:19:7 - 1:19:11} {DIALOGUE}: That's all I do, Will.
{1:19:7 - 1:19:11} {DIALOGUE}: I tell stories.
{1:19:7 - 1:19:14} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{1:19:11 - 1:19:14} {DIALOGUE}: You tell lies, Dad.
{1:19:15 - 1:19:16} {DIALOGUE}: You tell amusing lies.
{1:19:16 - 1:19:19} {DIALOGUE}: Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime.
{1:19:19 - 1:19:22} {DIALOGUE}: They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty.
{1:19:25 - 1:19:28} {DIALOGUE}: And the thing is, I believed you.
{1:19:30 - 1:19:33} {DIALOGUE}: I believed your stories so much longer than I should have.
{1:19:33 - 1:19:36} {DIALOGUE}: And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything!
{1:19:36 - 1:19:38} {DIALOGUE}: -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you.
{1:19:39 - 1:19:41} {DIALOGUE}: You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined.
{1:19:41 - 1:19:43} {DIALOGUE}: Just as charming and just as fake.
{1:19:41 - 1:19:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{1:19:43 - 1:19:46} {DIALOGUE}: You think I'm fake.
{1:19:43 - 1:19:51} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{1:19:47 - 1:19:51} {DIALOGUE}: Only on the surface.
{1:19:47 - 1:19:51} {DIALOGUE}: But that's all I've ever seen.
{1:19:47 - 1:20:0} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward looks away, angry and disbelieving.
{1:19:47 - 1:20:0} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{1:19:59 - 1:20:0} {DIALOGUE}: Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here.

{1:20:0 - 1:20:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{1:20:6 - 1:20:8} {DIALOGUE}: It would kill you, huh?

{1:20:10 - 1:20:13} {DIALOGUE}: What do you want, Will?

{1:20:14 - 1:20:15} {DIALOGUE}: Yourself.
{1:20:15 - 1:20:19} {DIALOGUE}: Good, bad, everything.

{1:20:15 - 1:20:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD

{1:36:53 - 1:37:1} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{1:36:57 - 1:37:1} {DIALOGUE}: Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that.

{1:37:1 - 1:37:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY

{1:37:6 - 1:37:11} {CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD

{1:37:23 - 1:37:27} {DIALOGUE}: I'll be here, and you'll come and go as you please to one place or another.
{1:37:27 - 1:37:29} {DIALOGUE}: Do I have that right?

{1:37:52 - 1:37:54} {DIALOGUE}: Some sort of midlife crisis?

{1:44:6 - 1:44:12} {DIALOGUE}: I envied you so much.
{1:44:6 - 1:44:12} {DIALOGUE}: The way Eddie would talk about you when you were at Missouri, that award you won.
{1:44:6 - 1:44:12} {DIALOGUE}: Congratulations, incidentally.
{1:44:6 - 1:44:12} {DIALOGUE}: And when you got the job at the A.P., everything, he was so proud of you.
{1:44:6 - 1:44:12} {DIALOGUE}: I mean, that's the thing.

{1:44:6 - 1:44:12} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY

{1:44:8 - 1:44:12} {DIALOGUE}: I wanted to be as important to him as you were, and I was never going to be.

{1:48:25 - 1:48:29} {DIALOGUE}: And I suppose if I had to choose between the true version and an elaborate one involving a fish and a wedding ring, I might choose the fancy version.
{1:48:37 - 1:48:39} {DIALOGUE}: But that's just me.
