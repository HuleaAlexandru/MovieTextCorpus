{0:30:43 - 0:30:48} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORGE
{0:30:46 - 0:30:48} {DIALOGUE}: Thank you very much.
{0:30:46 - 0:30:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. CAMPBELL
{0:30:48 - 0:30:50} {DIALOGUE}: It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
{0:30:48 - 0:30:54} {CHARACTER_NAME}: POTTER
{0:30:52 - 0:30:54} {DIALOGUE}: I'll go further than that.
{0:30:54 - 0:30:58} {DIALOGUE}: I'll say that to the public Peter Bailey was the Building and Loan.
{0:30:54 - 0:31:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everyone looks at him surprised.
{0:30:54 - 0:31:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: UNCLE BILLY
{0:30:54 - 0:31:3} {META_DATA}: (trying to control himself)
{0:31:1 - 0:31:3} {DIALOGUE}: Oh, that's fine, Potter, coming from you, considering that you probably drove him to his grave.
{0:31:1 - 0:31:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: POTTER
{0:31:1 - 0:31:7} {DIALOGUE}: Peter Bailey was not a business man.
{0:31:6 - 0:31:7} {DIALOGUE}: That's what killed him.
{0:31:7 - 0:31:10} {DIALOGUE}: Oh, I don't mean any disrespect to him, God rest his soul.
{0:31:14 - 0:31:18} {DIALOGUE}: He was a man of high ideals, so-called, but ideals without common sense can ruin this town.
{0:31:14 - 0:31:28} {META_DATA}: (picking up papers from table)
{0:31:25 - 0:31:28} {DIALOGUE}: Now, you take this loan here to Ernie Bishop... You know, that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi.
{0:31:28 - 0:31:31} {DIALOGUE}: You know... I happen to know the bank turned down this loan, but he comes here and we're building him a house worth five thousand dollars.
{0:31:39 - 0:31:41} {DIALOGUE}: Why?
{0:31:39 - 0:31:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: George is at the door of the office, holding his coat and papers, ready to leave.
{0:31:39 - 0:31:41} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORGE
{0:31:39 - 0:31:41} {DIALOGUE}: Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter.
{0:31:41 - 0:31:44} {DIALOGUE}: You have all the papers there.
{0:31:41 - 0:31:44} {DIALOGUE}: His salary, insurance.

{0:31:44 - 0:31:48} {CHARACTER_NAME}: POTTER
{0:31:44 - 0:31:48} {META_DATA}: (sarcastically)

{0:31:46 - 0:31:48} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORGE
{0:31:46 - 0:31:48} {DIALOGUE}: Yes, sir.
{0:31:46 - 0:31:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: POTTER
{0:31:48 - 0:31:52} {DIALOGUE}: You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money.
{0:31:55 - 0:31:56} {DIALOGUE}: What does that get us?
{0:32:0 - 0:32:1} {DIALOGUE}: A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class.
{0:32:2 - 0:32:5} {DIALOGUE}: And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas.
{0:32:11 - 0:32:13} {DIALOGUE}: Now, I say...
{0:32:11 - 0:32:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: George puts down his coat and comes around to the table, incensed by what Potter is saying about his father.
{0:32:11 - 0:32:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORGE
{0:32:13 - 0:32:16} {DIALOGUE}: Just a minute – just a minute.
{0:32:13 - 0:32:16} {DIALOGUE}: Now, hold on, Mr. Potter.
{0:32:16 - 0:32:19} {DIALOGUE}: You're right when you say my father was no business man.
{0:32:16 - 0:32:19} {DIALOGUE}: I know that.
{0:32:19 - 0:32:22} {DIALOGUE}: Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know.
{0:32:23 - 0:32:26} {DIALOGUE}: But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was... Why, in the twenty- five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself.
{0:32:31 - 0:32:33} {DIALOGUE}: Isn't that right, Uncle Billy?
{0:32:33 - 0:32:36} {DIALOGUE}: He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me.
{0:32:36 - 0:32:39} {DIALOGUE}: But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter.
{0:32:39 - 0:32:43} {DIALOGUE}: And what's wrong with that?
{0:32:39 - 0:32:43} {DIALOGUE}: Why... Here, you're all businessmen here.
{0:32:39 - 0:32:46} {DIALOGUE}: Doesn't it make them better citizens?
{0:32:43 - 0:32:46} {DIALOGUE}: Doesn't it make them better customers?
{0:32:46 - 0:32:48} {DIALOGUE}: You... you said... What'd you say just a minute ago?
{0:32:50 - 0:32:52} {DIALOGUE}: ... They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home.
{0:32:52 - 0:32:54} {DIALOGUE}: Wait!
{0:32:52 - 0:32:54} {DIALOGUE}: Wait for what?
{0:32:54 - 0:32:55} {DIALOGUE}: Until their children grow up and leave them?
{0:32:55 - 0:32:58} {DIALOGUE}: Until they're so old and broken- down that they... Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars?
{0:33:4 - 0:33:8} {DIALOGUE}: Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about... they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community.
{0:33:8 - 0:33:10} {DIALOGUE}: Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath?
{0:33:12 - 0:33:14} {DIALOGUE}: Anyway, my father didn't think so.
{0:33:17 - 0:33:20} {DIALOGUE}: People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle.
{0:33:21 - 0:33:23} {DIALOGUE}: Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!
{0:33:21 - 0:33:25} {CHARACTER_NAME}: POTTER
{0:33:23 - 0:33:25} {DIALOGUE}: I'm not interested in your book.

{0:33:25 - 0:33:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORGE
{0:33:28 - 0:33:30} {DIALOGUE}: I know very well what you're talking about.
{0:33:30 - 0:33:32} {DIALOGUE}: You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you.
{0:33:32 - 0:33:35} {DIALOGUE}: That's what you're talking about, I know.
{0:33:32 - 0:33:37} {META_DATA}: (to the Board)
{0:33:35 - 0:33:37} {DIALOGUE}: Well, I've said too much.
{0:33:35 - 0:33:37} {DIALOGUE}: I..
{0:33:38 - 0:33:41} {DIALOGUE}: You're the Board here.
{0:33:38 - 0:33:41} {DIALOGUE}: You do what you want with this thing.
{0:33:41 - 0:33:42} {DIALOGUE}: Just one thing more, though.
{0:33:42 - 0:33:45} {DIALOGUE}: This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter.
{0:33:49 - 0:33:50} {DIALOGUE}: Come on, Uncle Billy!
{0:33:49 - 0:33:59} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: George leaves the room, followed by the jubilant Uncle Billy.
{0:33:49 - 0:33:59} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Potter's face is grim with hatred.

{0:33:49 - 0:33:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: POTTER
{0:33:56 - 0:33:59} {DIALOGUE}: Sentimental hogwash!

{1:8:36 - 1:8:40} {DIALOGUE}: In fact, you have beaten me, George, and as anyone in this county can tell you, that takes some doing.
{1:8:41 - 1:8:44} {DIALOGUE}: Take during the depression, for instance.
{1:8:44 - 1:8:47} {DIALOGUE}: You and I were the only ones that kept our heads.

{1:9:24 - 1:9:28} {DIALOGUE}: A child or two comes along, and you won't even be able to save the ten.
{1:9:28 - 1:9:33} {DIALOGUE}: Now, if this young man of twenty-eight was a common, ordinary yokel, I'd say he was doing fine.
{1:9:35 - 1:9:40} {DIALOGUE}: But George Bailey is not a common, ordinary yokel.
{1:9:43 - 1:9:47} {DIALOGUE}: He's an intelligent, smart, ambitious young man — who hates his job – who hates the Building and Loan almost as much as I do.
{1:9:49 - 1:9:54} {DIALOGUE}: A young man who's been dying to get out on his own ever since he was born.
{1:9:54 - 1:9:57} {DIALOGUE}: A young man... the smartest one of the crowd, mind you, a young man who has to sit by and watch his friends go places, because he's trapped.
{1:10:2 - 1:10:6} {DIALOGUE}: Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic-eaters.

{1:10:48 - 1:10:49} {DIALOGUE}: You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
{1:10:48 - 1:10:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORGE
