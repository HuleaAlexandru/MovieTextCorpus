{0:43:53 - 0:44:1} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{0:43:57 - 0:44:1} {DIALOGUE}: If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree with you.
{0:43:57 - 0:44:10} {DIALOGUE}: Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here?
{0:44:8 - 0:44:10} {DIALOGUE}: It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know.
