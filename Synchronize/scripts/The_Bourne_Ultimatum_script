{0:31:15 - 0:31:20} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VOSEN?
{0:31:15 - 0:31:20} {DIALOGUE}: We don't know.
{0:31:15 - 0:31:20} {DIALOGUE}: But just the fact that he was there means he's up to something, don't you think?
{0:31:15 - 0:31:20} {DIALOGUE}: Maybe he's the source?
{0:31:15 - 0:31:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 36
