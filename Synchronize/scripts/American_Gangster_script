{1:27:59 - 1:28:8} {DIALOGUE}: Unfortunately not all my people are as enlightened.
{1:28:5 - 1:28:8} {DIALOGUE}: Ask them, What is civil rights, they don't know.
{1:28:10 - 1:28:13} {DIALOGUE}: They're not as open to change from the way things are done and who's doing it.
{1:28:13 - 1:28:17} {DIALOGUE}: But I can talk to them so there won't be any misunderstanding.
{1:28:18 - 1:28:21} {DIALOGUE}: That's what I mean by peace of mind.

{1:28:18 - 1:28:48} {DIALOGUE}: Tosca slips on his best poker face.
{1:28:18 - 1:28:48} {DIALOGUE}: Fifty thousand a kilo would be an extraordinary coup for him.
