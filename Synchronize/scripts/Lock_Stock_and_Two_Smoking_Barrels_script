{0:0:0 - 0:0:57} {DIALOGUE}: Three of any kind is the highest you can get: the odds are four hundred and twenty- five to one.
{0:0:0 - 0:0:57} {DIALOGUE}: Then it's a running flush - you know, all the same suit running in order; then a straight, then a flush, then a pair, and finally whatever the highest card you are holding.
{0:0:0 - 0:0:57} {DIALOGUE}: There are some tell- tale signs that are valuable; I am not going to tell you them because it took me long enough to learn them, but these can only help a player, not make one.
