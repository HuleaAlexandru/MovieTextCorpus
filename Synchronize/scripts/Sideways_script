{0:18:11 - 0:18:22} {DIALOGUE}: I just called to find out about the salmon -- for our wedding -- to be more involved, like you said -- and all you want to do is get into it about last night and, okay, I'm sorry.
{0:18:11 - 0:18:22} {DIALOGUE}: I'm sorry I didn't call.
{0:18:11 - 0:18:22} {DIALOGUE}: You're totally right.
{0:18:11 - 0:18:22} {DIALOGUE}: I know, but I'm trying to make this the best wedding I can with the best wine we can find.
{0:18:11 - 0:18:22} {DIALOGUE}: Don't I get any credit for that?

{0:18:20 - 0:18:25} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{0:18:22 - 0:18:25} {DIALOGUE}: First take your glass and examine the wine against the light.

{0:18:25 - 0:18:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES

{0:18:37 - 0:18:41} {DIALOGUE}: What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim.
{0:18:41 - 0:18:44} {DIALOGUE}: Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds.
{0:18:41 - 0:18:50} {DIALOGUE}: This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly.
{0:18:48 - 0:18:50} {DIALOGUE}: Now stick your nose in it.
{0:18:48 - 0:18:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack waves the glass under his nose as if it were a perfume bottle.

{0:19:25 - 0:19:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles expertly swirls the wine.
{0:19:25 - 0:19:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack follows suit.
{0:19:25 - 0:19:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{0:19:32 - 0:19:35} {DIALOGUE}: Oxygenating it opens it up, unlocks the aroma and the flavors.
{0:19:32 - 0:19:35} {DIALOGUE}: Very important.
{0:19:35 - 0:19:37} {DIALOGUE}: Now we smell again.

{0:19:40 - 0:19:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles chews his before swallowing.
{0:19:40 - 0:19:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{0:19:50 - 0:19:53} {DIALOGUE}: How would you rate this one?
{0:19:50 - 0:19:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{0:19:53 - 0:19:56} {DIALOGUE}: Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.

{0:51:29 - 0:51:35} {META_DATA}: (tastes again)

{0:53:23 - 0:53:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{0:53:27 - 0:53:30} {DIALOGUE}: So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
{0:53:27 - 0:53:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{0:53:27 - 0:53:35} {DIALOGUE}: Mrnmm, yeah... but not really.
{0:53:27 - 0:53:35} {DIALOGUE}: It shifts around a lot.
{0:53:27 - 0:53:35} {DIALOGUE}: Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father.
{0:53:27 - 0:53:35} {DIALOGUE}: And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
{0:53:27 - 0:53:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{0:53:27 - 0:53:35} {DIALOGUE}: Wow.
{0:53:27 - 0:53:35} {DIALOGUE}: Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published.
{0:53:33 - 0:53:35} {DIALOGUE}: Really.
{0:54:7 - 0:54:10} {DIALOGUE}: I know how hard it is.

{0:54:10 - 0:54:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{0:54:12 - 0:54:15} {DIALOGUE}: Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it.
{0:54:15 - 0:54:18} {DIALOGUE}: Just like in high school.
{0:54:15 - 0:54:20} {DIALOGUE}: It never changes.

{0:54:28 - 0:54:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{0:54:31 - 0:54:35} {DIALOGUE}: I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
{0:54:31 - 0:54:41} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{0:54:38 - 0:54:41} {DIALOGUE}: So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
{0:54:38 - 0:54:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{0:54:55 - 0:54:59} {DIALOGUE}: Well...
{0:54:55 - 0:54:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{0:54:55 - 0:54:59} {DIALOGUE}: I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car.
{0:54:55 - 0:55:6} {DIALOGUE}: It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
{0:54:55 - 0:55:6} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{0:54:55 - 0:55:6} {DIALOGUE}: Oh yeah.
{0:55:3 - 0:55:6} {DIALOGUE}: Who cares?
{0:55:6 - 0:55:8} {DIALOGUE}: I'm the queen of typos.
{0:55:6 - 0:55:51} {META_DATA}: (sipping the wine)
{0:55:6 - 0:55:51} {DIALOGUE}: Wow, this is really starting to open up.
{0:55:6 - 0:55:51} {DIALOGUE}: What do you think?
{0:55:6 - 0:55:51} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{0:55:6 - 0:55:51} {DIALOGUE}: My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
{0:55:6 - 0:55:51} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{0:55:47 - 0:55:51} {DIALOGUE}: Can I ask you a personal question?
{0:55:47 - 0:55:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{0:55:47 - 0:55:53} {META_DATA}: (bracing himself)
{0:55:51 - 0:55:53} {DIALOGUE}: Sure.
{0:55:51 - 0:55:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{0:55:53 - 0:55:55} {DIALOGUE}: Why are you so into Pinot?
{0:55:55 - 0:55:58} {DIALOGUE}: It's like a thing with you.
{0:55:55 - 0:56:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles laughs at first, then smiles wistfully at the question.
{0:55:55 - 0:56:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He searches for the answer in his glass and begins slowly.
{0:55:55 - 0:56:2} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{0:55:59 - 0:56:2} {DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{0:56:2 - 0:56:6} {DIALOGUE}: It's a hard grape to grow.
{0:56:6 - 0:56:8} {DIALOGUE}: As you know.
{0:56:11 - 0:56:14} {DIALOGUE}: It's thin-skinned, temperamental, ripens early.
{0:56:21 - 0:56:24} {DIALOGUE}: It's not a survivor like Cabernet that can grow anywhere and thrive even when neglected.
{0:56:30 - 0:56:34} {DIALOGUE}: Pinot needs constant care and attention and in fact can only grow in specific little tucked- away corners of the world.
{0:56:38 - 0:56:43} {DIALOGUE}: And only the most patient and nurturing growers can do it really, can tap into Pinot's most fragile, delicate qualities.
{0:56:53 - 0:56:56} {DIALOGUE}: Only when someone has taken the time to truly understand its potential can Pinot be coaxed into its fullest expression.
{0:56:59 - 0:57:2} {DIALOGUE}: And when that happens, its flavors are the most haunting and brilliant and subtle and thrilling and ancient on the planet.
{0:56:59 - 0:57:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Maya has found this answer revealing and moving.
{0:56:59 - 0:57:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{0:57:15 - 0:57:18} {DIALOGUE}: I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason.
{0:57:18 - 0:57:22} {DIALOGUE}: By comparison.
{0:57:18 - 0:57:32} {DIALOGUE}: How about you?
{0:57:18 - 0:57:32} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{0:57:18 - 0:57:32} {DIALOGUE}: What about me?
{0:57:18 - 0:57:32} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{0:57:18 - 0:57:32} {DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{0:57:28 - 0:57:32} {DIALOGUE}: Why are you into wine?
{0:57:28 - 0:57:40} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{0:57:36 - 0:57:40} {DIALOGUE}: I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband.
{0:57:40 - 0:57:44} {DIALOGUE}: He had a big, kind of show-off cellar.
{0:57:51 - 0:57:54} {DIALOGUE}: But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
{0:57:51 - 0:57:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{0:57:51 - 0:57:56} {DIALOGUE}: Yeah?
{0:57:55 - 0:57:56} {DIALOGUE}: Like what?
{0:57:55 - 0:57:58} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{0:57:57 - 0:57:58} {DIALOGUE}: Like what a fraud he was.
{0:57:57 - 0:58:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles laughs.
{0:57:57 - 0:58:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{0:58:6 - 0:58:8} {DIALOGUE}: No, but I do like to think about the life of wine, how it's a living thing.
{0:58:6 - 0:58:31} {DIALOGUE}: I like to think about what was going on the year the grapes were growing, how the sun was shining that summer or if it rained... what the weather was like.
{0:58:27 - 0:58:31} {DIALOGUE}: I think about all those people who tended and picked the grapes, and if it's an old wine, how many of them must be dead by now.
{0:58:40 - 0:58:44} {DIALOGUE}: I love how wine continues to evolve, how every time I open a bottle it's going to taste different than if I had opened it on any other day.
{0:58:44 - 0:58:49} {DIALOGUE}: Because a bottle of wine is actually alive -- it's constantly evolving and gaining complexity.
{0:59:1 - 0:59:4} {DIALOGUE}: That is, until it peaks -- like your '61 -- and begins its steady, inevitable decline.
{0:59:11 - 0:59:14} {DIALOGUE}: And it tastes so fucking good.
{0:59:11 - 0:59:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now it is Miles's turn to be swept away.
{0:59:11 - 0:59:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Maya's face tells us the moment is right, but Miles remains frozen.
{0:59:11 - 0:59:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He needs another sign, and Maya is bold enough to offer it: reaches out and places one hand atop his.
{0:59:11 - 0:59:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{0:59:11 - 0:59:34} {META_DATA}: (pointing)
{0:59:11 - 0:59:34} {DIALOGUE}: Bathroom over there?
{0:59:11 - 0:59:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{0:59:32 - 0:59:34} {DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{0:59:32 - 1:0:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles gets up and walks out.
{0:59:32 - 1:0:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Maya sighs and gets and American Spirit out of her purse.
{0:59:32 - 1:0:11} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. STEPHANIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
{0:59:32 - 1:0:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The bathroom's a MESS -- the shower curtain is filthy, and the chipped and water-stained tub is filled with CHILDREN'S BATH TOYS.
{0:59:32 - 1:0:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles is bent over the sink splashing water on his face, trying to sober up and gather his courage.
{0:59:32 - 1:0:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stands, and without drying his face, presses his palms against his cheeks.
{0:59:32 - 1:0:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he takes a deep breath and drops his hands.
{0:59:32 - 1:0:11} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{1:0:7 - 1:0:11} {DIALOGUE}: You are such a loser.
{1:0:14 - 1:0:17} {DIALOGUE}: Come on!
{1:0:14 - 1:0:39} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
{1:0:14 - 1:0:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles comes out of the bathroom and looks for Maya, but she's not there.
{1:0:14 - 1:0:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he hears a noise from the kitchen, so he goes through the door into --
{1:0:14 - 1:0:39} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
{1:0:14 - 1:0:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Maya is at the sink, filling a glass with water.
{1:0:14 - 1:0:39} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{1:0:37 - 1:0:39} {DIALOGUE}: I was just getting some water.
{1:0:39 - 1:0:41} {DIALOGUE}: You want some water?
{1:0:39 - 1:1:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles goes to stand by her and accepts a glass of water.
{1:0:39 - 1:1:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just as she's about to fill a second glass, he stops her and looks her in the eye, trying to recapture a moment that is long gone.
{1:0:39 - 1:1:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He kisses her and she kisses back, but the whole thing feels strained and awkward.
{1:0:39 - 1:1:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After a few seconds, Maya breaks away.
{1:0:39 - 1:1:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{1:0:39 - 1:1:29} {DIALOGUE}: Nice.
{1:0:39 - 1:1:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But instead of resuming the kiss, she steps past him, heading back into the living room.
{1:0:39 - 1:1:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA (O.S.)
{1:0:39 - 1:1:29} {DIALOGUE}: I should probably get going.
{1:0:39 - 1:1:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles realizes he's blown it and silently berates himself.
{1:0:39 - 1:1:29} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SAAB - NIGHT
{1:0:39 - 1:1:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles drives down the hill behind Maya's car, which leads him through this very rural road.
{1:0:39 - 1:1:29} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. WHERE THE ROAD MEETS THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
{1:0:39 - 1:1:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Maya's car comes to a stop just ahead of the Saab.
{1:0:39 - 1:1:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She puts it in PARK and gets out.
{1:0:39 - 1:1:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: AT THE SAAB --
{1:0:39 - 1:1:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles rolls down his window as Maya leans over.
{1:0:39 - 1:1:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{1:1:26 - 1:1:29} {DIALOGUE}: You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
{1:1:26 - 1:1:31} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{1:1:29 - 1:1:31} {DIALOGUE}: Got it.
{1:1:29 - 1:1:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{1:1:31 - 1:1:34} {DIALOGUE}: I had a good time tonight, Miles.
{1:1:31 - 1:1:34} {DIALOGUE}: I really did.
{1:1:31 - 1:1:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{1:1:34 - 1:1:37} {DIALOGUE}: Good.

{1:1:34 - 1:1:42} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{1:1:38 - 1:1:42} {DIALOGUE}: Okay.
{1:1:38 - 1:1:42} {DIALOGUE}: See you around.
{1:1:38 - 1:1:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{1:1:43 - 1:1:46} {DIALOGUE}: Um... did you still want to read my novel?
{1:1:43 - 1:1:48} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{1:1:46 - 1:1:48} {DIALOGUE}: Oh, yeah.
{1:1:46 - 1:1:48} {DIALOGUE}: Sure.
{1:1:46 - 1:1:48} {DIALOGUE}: Of course.
{1:1:46 - 1:1:59} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles turns to the backseat, locates a large MANUSCRIPT BOX, and hands it to Maya.
{1:1:46 - 1:1:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{1:1:46 - 1:1:59} {DIALOGUE}: Wow.
{1:1:57 - 1:1:59} {DIALOGUE}: Great.

{1:2:8 - 1:3:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Fishing the phone out of Jack's windbreaker pocket, he looks at the CALLER ID: "Erganian, Christine" and the number.
{1:2:8 - 1:3:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He briefly considers his options -- answer it?
{1:2:8 - 1:3:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: shut it off?
{1:2:8 - 1:3:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -- before placing it atop Jack's suitcase.
{1:2:8 - 1:3:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The moment he lies back down on the bed, the MOTEL PHONE RINGS.
{1:2:8 - 1:3:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An old DIGITAL CLOCK next to it reads 7:l0.
{1:2:8 - 1:3:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Miles closes his eyes and pulls the pillow over his aching head, we again --

{1:2:8 - 1:3:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles opens his bleary eyes and listens.
{1:2:8 - 1:3:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: FOOTSTEPS pound on the balcony outside, and Jack lets himself in, flushed and exuberant.
{1:2:8 - 1:3:42} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{1:3:38 - 1:3:42} {DIALOGUE}: Fucking chick is unbelievable.

{1:3:38 - 1:3:48} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{1:3:44 - 1:3:48} {DIALOGUE}: Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty.
{1:3:48 - 1:3:51} {DIALOGUE}: Nasty nasty nasty.
{1:3:48 - 1:3:54} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{1:3:51 - 1:3:54} {DIALOGUE}: Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system.

{1:4:22 - 1:4:38} {DIALOGUE}: It's on me.

{1:4:22 - 1:4:38} {META_DATA}: (sitting down)
{1:4:35 - 1:4:38} {DIALOGUE}: Count me out.

{1:4:35 - 1:4:43} {DIALOGUE}: Oooh, I see.
{1:4:41 - 1:4:43} {DIALOGUE}: Didn't go so good last night, huh?
{1:4:41 - 1:4:43} {DIALOGUE}: That's a shocker.
{1:4:44 - 1:4:47} {DIALOGUE}: You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood?
{1:4:49 - 1:4:51} {DIALOGUE}: You dumb fuck.
{1:4:49 - 1:4:56} {DIALOGUE}: Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
{1:4:49 - 1:4:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles looks down.
{1:4:49 - 1:4:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack heads for the door.

{1:5:18 - 1:5:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{1:5:18 - 1:5:35} {DIALOGUE}: I've got no problem calling her.

{1:5:18 - 1:5:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK

{1:9:33 - 1:9:38} {DIALOGUE}: Um... not exactly.
{1:9:36 - 1:9:38} {DIALOGUE}: But I've been honest.
{1:9:38 - 1:9:40} {DIALOGUE}: I haven't told her I'm available.
{1:9:40 - 1:9:43} {DIALOGUE}: And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days.
{1:9:43 - 1:9:46} {DIALOGUE}: Besides...
{1:9:43 - 1:9:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack stops short in a rare instance of self-censorship.
{1:9:43 - 1:9:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES

{1:9:50 - 1:9:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES

{1:9:50 - 1:9:57} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK

{1:10:2 - 1:10:13} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{1:10:10 - 1:10:13} {DIALOGUE}: I fully realize that making a change like that might be tricky for certain people to accept at first, but life is short, Miles.
{1:10:16 - 1:10:20} {DIALOGUE}: I've got to be sure I'm doing the right thing before taking such a big step.
{1:10:20 - 1:10:23} {DIALOGUE}: And not just for my sake.
{1:10:23 - 1:10:26} {DIALOGUE}: I'm thinking about Christine's feelings too.
{1:10:23 - 1:10:30} {DIALOGUE}: I take marriage very seriously -- always have.
{1:10:23 - 1:10:30} {DIALOGUE}: That's why I've never done it before.

{1:10:23 - 1:10:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{1:10:26 - 1:10:30} {DIALOGUE}: Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes.
{1:10:30 - 1:10:33} {DIALOGUE}: She's not uptight or controlling.
{1:10:30 - 1:10:33} {DIALOGUE}: She's just cool.
{1:10:30 - 1:10:36} {DIALOGUE}: Things are so easy with her.
{1:10:33 - 1:10:36} {DIALOGUE}: Smells different.
{1:10:33 - 1:10:36} {DIALOGUE}: Tastes different.

{1:10:47 - 1:10:49} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{1:10:47 - 1:10:49} {DIALOGUE}: Deep.
{1:10:47 - 1:10:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles draws a long sigh.
{1:10:47 - 1:10:58} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{1:10:47 - 1:10:58} {DIALOGUE}: Don't get all judgmental on me.
{1:10:47 - 1:10:58} {DIALOGUE}: This is my deal.
{1:10:47 - 1:10:58} {DIALOGUE}: It's my life, and it's my call.
{1:10:47 - 1:10:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They fall silent for a moment.
{1:10:47 - 1:10:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then --
{1:10:47 - 1:10:58} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{1:10:47 - 1:10:58} {DIALOGUE}: I was hoping to get some understanding from you.
{1:10:47 - 1:10:58} {DIALOGUE}: And I'm not getting it.
{1:10:47 - 1:10:58} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{1:10:56 - 1:10:58} {DIALOGUE}: Understanding of what?
{1:10:56 - 1:11:4} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{1:11:2 - 1:11:4} {DIALOGUE}: Like I might be in love with another woman.
{1:11:2 - 1:11:6} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{1:11:4 - 1:11:6} {DIALOGUE}: In love?
{1:11:6 - 1:11:10} {DIALOGUE}: Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love?
{1:11:10 - 1:11:13} {DIALOGUE}: And give up everything?
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {DIALOGUE}: Look who's talking.
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {DIALOGUE}: You've been there.
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {DIALOGUE}: Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man?
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {DIALOGUE}: Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do?
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {DIALOGUE}: Huh?
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {DIALOGUE}: Was it?
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {DIALOGUE}: Is she a part of my life now?
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {DIALOGUE}: This is totally different.
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {DIALOGUE}: I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about.
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {DIALOGUE}: That's the distinction.
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {DIALOGUE}: I have not made the commitment yet.
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {DIALOGUE}: I am not married.
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {DIALOGUE}: I have not said the words.
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {DIALOGUE}: In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore.
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {DIALOGUE}: Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {DIALOGUE}: And what about Stephanie?
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {DIALOGUE}: She's a woman -- with a kid.
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {DIALOGUE}: A single mom.
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {DIALOGUE}: What do you think she's looking for?
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {DIALOGUE}: Huh?
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{1:11:10 - 1:11:17} {META_DATA}: (interrupting)
{1:11:16 - 1:11:17} {DIALOGUE}: Here's what I'm thinking.
{1:11:18 - 1:11:21} {DIALOGUE}: We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard.
{1:11:21 - 1:11:25} {DIALOGUE}: You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side.
{1:11:25 - 1:11:28} {DIALOGUE}: Then you get inspired and write a new novel.
{1:11:32 - 1:11:35} {DIALOGUE}: As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away.
{1:11:32 - 1:11:35} {DIALOGUE}: Not even.
{1:11:32 - 1:11:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{1:11:32 - 1:11:35} {DIALOGUE}: You're crazy.
{1:11:35 - 1:11:37} {DIALOGUE}: You've gone crazy.
{1:11:35 - 1:11:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{1:11:35 - 1:11:43} {DIALOGUE}: What do you care anyway?
{1:11:35 - 1:11:43} {DIALOGUE}: You don't even like Christine.
{1:11:35 - 1:11:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{1:11:35 - 1:11:43} {DIALOGUE}: What?
{1:11:35 - 1:11:43} {DIALOGUE}: Of course I like Christine.
{1:11:35 - 1:11:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{1:11:35 - 1:11:43} {DIALOGUE}: You said she was shallow.
{1:11:35 - 1:11:43} {DIALOGUE}: Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
{1:11:35 - 1:11:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{1:11:35 - 1:11:43} {DIALOGUE}: That was three years ago after that first party!
{1:11:35 - 1:11:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{1:11:40 - 1:11:43} {DIALOGUE}: Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor.
{1:11:43 - 1:11:46} {DIALOGUE}: All I have is my instinct.
{1:11:43 - 1:11:50} {META_DATA}: (his hand on his chest)
{1:11:43 - 1:11:50} {DIALOGUE}: My intuition -- that's all I have.
{1:11:48 - 1:11:50} {DIALOGUE}: And you're asking me to go against it.
