{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: FINELY WRAPPED PACKET OF VIOLIN STRINGS.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WE CUT TO the hands stringing a VIOLIN.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's not a high end piece, but it is quite nice.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WE CUT TO a wide shot of the study.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sitting in a chair with violin in hand is SOLOMON NORTHUP; a man in his late twenties.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everything about Solomon, his mien and manner, is distinguished.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But he, too, seems a hardy individual.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Someone who has known manual labor in his time.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon begins to lightly play his violin, as if testing the strings, their tuning.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Satisfied, Solomon begins to play vigorously.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he does, we make a HARD CUT TO:
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - EVENING
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We come in on a lively affair.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A dinner party is being thrown within the confines of a fairly stately house.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In attendance are EIGHT COUPLES.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All are WHITE and all are FAIRLY YOUNG, in their early twenties.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The men and women are dressed in very fine attire.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We should get the sense that for the most part they are people of means.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The furniture has been set aside in the living room.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a REEL.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The music they are dancing to is being played by Solomon, having cut directly from the tune he was previously playing.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He plays with a light determination, and in no way seems possessed with empty servitude.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon concludes the reel, and the dancers break into enthusiastic applause, which is followed by personal thanks and congratulations from all.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It should be clear that despite their respective races there is much admiration and appreciation for Solomon's abilities.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/BEDROOM - MORNING
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is a Saturday morning.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clad in her finest attire is ANNE; Solomon's wife, a few years younger than he.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see also the Northup children: MARGARET who is eight, and ALONZO who is five.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are handsome, and well groomed kids.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Anne straightens up the children.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She finishes,

{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {META_DATA}: 3 CONTINUED:
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: she rises up and stands behind them, almost as if preparing to pose for a portrait.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They all wait a moment, then Solomon enters the foyer.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stands and looks admiringly at his family.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ADMIRINGLY stressed.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It isn't that he doesn't have love for them, he does as well.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But in the moment, he truly admires his greatest accomplishment: a family that is healthy and well and provided for.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He goes to his children, and hands each a coin, then goes to Anne.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gives her a kiss on the cheek.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The children giggle at the sight.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. STREET - DAY
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon and his family are out walking along the streets and groves of Saratoga.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The streets are well populated this morning with many people out strolling.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Most are WHITE, but there are BLACKS as well.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are FREED BLACKS who mingle fairly easily - though not always completely - with the whites.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see, too, a few BLACK SLAVES who travel with their WHITE MASTERS.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: These pairings are largely from the south and - despite the fact the blacks are slaves - they are not physically downtrodden, not field hands.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are well dressed and "leading apparently an easy life" - comparatively speaking - as they trail their masters.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As they walk, Solomon and his family arrive to an intersection well-worn and muddied from horse and cart traffic.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon and his children easily jump across the muck.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Anne stands at the lip of the puddle, calls for Solomon to help her across.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ANNE

{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {DIALOGUE}: Jump.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The children, now smiling as well, egg their mother on.

{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {DIALOGUE}: You can make it.

{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {DIALOGUE}: I will not ruin my dress.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {DIALOGUE}: Catch me!
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon moves close, holds out his arms.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Yet, there's still just a bit of mischievousness in his eyes.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Anne gives her husband a lightly stern look to which Solomon replies.

{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {DIALOGUE}: You will.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And with that Anne takes the leap.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon catches her, swings her around grandly and sets her down lightly to the delighted applause of the children.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: That done, Solomon takes Anne's hand and leads her on.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Solomon and his family make their way, among the slaves on the street, we see one in particular; JASPER.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he trails his MASTER he can't help but note Solomon and his family as they enter A STORE.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His intrigue of this most handsome and harmonious group should be obvious.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With his Master occupied, Jasper moves slyly toward the STORE.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Frozen on the spot, Jasper looks on admiringly.
{0:0:0 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly a voice barks out-

{0:10:36 - 0:11:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMILTON

{0:11:48 - 0:12:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hamilton is placing a spittoon near Solomon's bed, where a prone and reeling Solomon lays.
{0:11:48 - 0:12:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hamilton sits on the bed.
{0:11:48 - 0:12:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he strokes Solomon's sweaty face, Hamilton speaks sweetly.
{0:11:48 - 0:12:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMILTON
{0:11:48 - 0:12:35} {DIALOGUE}: I'm afraid that Brown and I haven't brought you much luck.

{0:12:46 - 0:12:48} {DIALOGUE}: And tomorrow...tomorrow you will feel as well and refreshed as though the earth were new again.
{0:12:46 - 0:12:53} {DIALOGUE}: Hamilton lingers a bit too long and a bit too close to Solomon for Brown's taste.

{0:12:51 - 0:12:57} {CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMILTON
{0:12:55 - 0:12:57} {DIALOGUE}: Such is the pity.
{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {DIALOGUE}: Displaying an odd sort of disappointment, Hamilton slinks away from the bed.
{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {DIALOGUE}: He crosses to, and BLOWS OUT A CANDLE.
{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {DIALOGUE}: The room goes dark with a blackness more than night.
{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {DIALOGUE}: Brown and Hamilton exit.
{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {DIALOGUE}: Solomon lays in the dark and moans.

{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon stirs, then slowly awakes to his new circumstances.
{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He finds himself in a nearly lightless room about twelve feet square with walls of solid masonry.
{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is a thick and well-locked door, a small window covered with iron bars and a shutter.
{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The only furniture is a wood stool and an old fashioned, dirty box stove.
{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Solomon rises he sees that his HANDS are CUFFED - the chain running to a bolt in the ground - and his LEGS IN IRONS.
{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At first Solomon is incredulous.
{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But that emotion is replaced first by fury and then panic.
{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He begins to pull on the chains, fight against them.
{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He does so with increasing desperation.
{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon flails about, the sounds of the steel chains whipping and beating against the masonry.
{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He grunts and screams without regard as the cuffs and irons bite into his flesh, but he cannot pull himself free.
{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After several minutes of intense effort, Solomon tires, slows, then finally he collapses.
{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And in this collapsed state he remains.

{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He hears sounds beyond the door...footsteps.
{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Eventually the door opens.
{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Enter JAMES BURCH - who runs the slave pen - and EBENEZER RADBURN who works as a turnkey and overseer.
{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the door opens, this is the first light to seep into the otherwise near-black room.
{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The shine is painful to Solomon's eyes.
{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With no salutation whatsoever, Burch

{0:12:55 - 0:13:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BURCH
{0:13:6 - 0:13:9} {DIALOGUE}: Well, my boy, how yah feel now?
{0:13:6 - 0:13:19} {DIALOGUE}: Solomon rises up as best he can.
{0:13:6 - 0:13:19} {DIALOGUE}: With all the resolve he can put together he states what he considers to be fact:
{0:13:6 - 0:13:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{0:13:6 - 0:13:19} {DIALOGUE}: I am Solomon Northup.
{0:13:15 - 0:13:19} {DIALOGUE}: I am a free man; a resident of Saratoga, New York.
{0:13:19 - 0:13:21} {DIALOGUE}: The residence also of my wife and children who are equally free.
{0:13:19 - 0:13:23} {DIALOGUE}: I have papers.
{0:13:21 - 0:13:23} {DIALOGUE}: You have no right whatsoever to detain me--
{0:13:21 - 0:13:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BURCH
{0:13:21 - 0:13:29} {DIALOGUE}: Yah not any--
{0:13:21 - 0:13:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{0:13:27 - 0:13:29} {DIALOGUE}: And I promise you - I promise - upon my liberation I will have satisfaction for this wrong.
{0:13:27 - 0:13:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BURCH
{0:13:33 - 0:13:34} {DIALOGUE}: Resolve this.

{0:13:35 - 0:13:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With confidence Solomon goes to the pocket of his trousers.
{0:13:35 - 0:13:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He searches one, then the other, but they are empty.
{0:13:35 - 0:13:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He feels quickly about himself, but clearly his papers have been lifted.
{0:13:35 - 0:13:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon's confidence shifts, but to resolve rather than fear.
{0:13:35 - 0:13:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Papers or none, he will not be easily cowed.
{0:13:35 - 0:13:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Still, Burch asserts:
{0:13:35 - 0:13:48} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BURCH (CONT'D)
{0:13:35 - 0:13:48} {DIALOGUE}: Yah no free man.
{0:13:46 - 0:13:48} {DIALOGUE}: And yah ain't from Saratoga.
{0:13:46 - 0:13:56} {DIALOGUE}: Yah from Georgia.
{0:13:46 - 0:13:56} {DIALOGUE}: A moment.
{0:13:46 - 0:13:56} {DIALOGUE}: Not a word spoken among the trio, but Solomon and Burch do some serious eye fucking, neither man yielding.
{0:13:46 - 0:13:56} {DIALOGUE}: Burch says again:
{0:13:46 - 0:13:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BURCH (CONT'D)
{0:13:54 - 0:13:56} {DIALOGUE}: Yah ain't a free man.
{0:13:58 - 0:14:2} {DIALOGUE}: Yah nuthin' but a Georgia runaway.
{0:13:58 - 0:14:2} {DIALOGUE}: Burch waits for Solomon to acquiesce.
{0:13:58 - 0:14:2} {DIALOGUE}: Solomon does not in any way.
{0:13:58 - 0:14:2} {DIALOGUE}: Both men exchange a long and daring stare.
{0:13:58 - 0:14:2} {DIALOGUE}: The two are clearly at an intellectual stand off.
{0:13:58 - 0:14:2} {DIALOGUE}: Burch, leans to Radburn, SAYS SOMETHING WHICH WE CANNOT
{0:13:58 - 0:14:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: DISTINGUISH.
{0:13:58 - 0:14:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Radburn walks off-camera and returns with a pair of "instruments:" a PADDLE - the flattened portion, which is about the size in circumference of two open hands, and bored with a small auger in numerous places.
{0:13:58 - 0:14:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He also carries a WHIP.
{0:13:58 - 0:14:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A cat-o-nine tails; a large rope of many strands.
{0:13:58 - 0:14:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The strands unraveled and a knot tied at the extremity of each.
{0:13:58 - 0:14:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Burch says again:
{0:13:58 - 0:14:2} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BURCH (CONT'D)
{0:13:58 - 0:14:2} {DIALOGUE}: Yah a runaway nigger from Georgia.
{0:13:58 - 0:14:47} {DIALOGUE}: Solomon stands with a quiet stoicism.
{0:13:58 - 0:14:47} {DIALOGUE}: He will say nothing of the kind.
{0:13:58 - 0:14:47} {DIALOGUE}: As that is the case, Solomon is seized by both men.
{0:13:58 - 0:14:47} {DIALOGUE}: He is pulled over the bench, face downward, shirt still on his back.
{0:13:58 - 0:14:47} {DIALOGUE}: Radburn then STEPS ON HIS CHAINS, holding Solomon down in a bent position.
{0:13:58 - 0:14:47} {DIALOGUE}: With no preamble, Burch begins to beat Solomon about the back with the paddle.
{0:13:58 - 0:14:47} {DIALOGUE}: Burch strikes him wordlessly - no taunting, no sneering.
{0:13:58 - 0:14:47} {DIALOGUE}: Solomon screaming against each blow.
{0:13:58 - 0:14:47} {DIALOGUE}: His back immediately SWELLING WITH WELTS AND
{0:13:58 - 0:14:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: BRUISES.
{0:13:58 - 0:14:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This beating continues on and on and on until quite literally Burch WEARS HIMSELF OUT with the effort.

{0:13:58 - 0:14:47} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{0:13:58 - 0:14:47} {DIALOGUE}: ...I..
{0:13:58 - 0:14:47} {DIALOGUE}: I insist... Burch regrets hearing this.
{0:13:58 - 0:14:47} {DIALOGUE}: Not from sympathy, but rather because he's nearly too tired to go back to beating Solomon.
{0:13:58 - 0:14:47} {DIALOGUE}: Yet, as if returning to work, Burch returns to pummeling Solomon.
{0:13:58 - 0:14:47} {DIALOGUE}: Burch punctuates the blows
{0:13:58 - 0:14:47} {META_DATA}: WITH:

{0:14:44 - 0:16:11} {DIALOGUE}: Burch continues to strike, and strike... This time until the paddle SNAPS IN HALF.
{0:14:44 - 0:16:11} {DIALOGUE}: Burch then GRABS THE WHIP.
{0:14:44 - 0:16:11} {DIALOGUE}: Hardly missing a stroke, he whips Solomon relentlessly, the flails cutting into Solomon's back.
{0:14:44 - 0:16:11} {DIALOGUE}: Again, Burch's arm tires before Solomon "breaks."
{0:14:44 - 0:16:11} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BURCH (CONT'D)
{0:14:44 - 0:16:11} {DIALOGUE}: Are yah slave?
{0:14:44 - 0:16:11} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{0:14:44 - 0:16:11} {DIALOGUE}: ...No... Burch goes back to whipping and whipping, and whipping...
{0:14:44 - 0:16:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SOLOMON'S BACK IS NOW TORN OPEN WITH LACERATIONS AND OOZING WITH BLOOD.
{0:14:44 - 0:16:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Finally Burch can whip no more.
{0:14:44 - 0:16:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pours sweat and sucks air, leaving himself just enough energy to take up his instruments and EXIT.
{0:14:44 - 0:16:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Radburn lingers for a moment.
{0:14:44 - 0:16:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes the irons off Solomon's legs.
{0:14:44 - 0:16:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Opens the window some.
{0:14:44 - 0:16:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he makes these gestures, in a patronizing and confidential manner, one wrought with poor sincerity::

{0:14:44 - 0:16:11} {DIALOGUE}: Often times the situation was resolved, and I think; what was all the beatin' and abuse for?
{0:14:44 - 0:16:11} {DIALOGUE}: Things end as they should, and the violence was for naught.
{0:14:44 - 0:16:11} {DIALOGUE}: So why cause trouble when they ain't no cause for it?
{0:14:44 - 0:16:11} {DIALOGUE}: Be of a cooperative nature, and things don't need be particularly unpleasant.

{0:47:12 - 0:48:25} {DIALOGUE}: The trio begin to hoist Solomon.

{1:10:35 - 1:11:35} {DIALOGUE}: Epps gives chase.
{1:10:35 - 1:11:35} {DIALOGUE}: Solomon begins to run around the large pig sty, easily keeping his distance.
{1:10:35 - 1:11:35} {DIALOGUE}: Epps, however is undeterred.
{1:10:35 - 1:11:35} {DIALOGUE}: He moves after Solomon as speedily as he can, which isn't very speedily at all.
{1:10:35 - 1:11:35} {DIALOGUE}: And quickly he tires.
{1:10:35 - 1:11:35} {DIALOGUE}: Epps is forced to bend over and suck air.
{1:10:35 - 1:11:35} {DIALOGUE}: Solomon maintains his distance, barely breathing hard.
{1:10:35 - 1:11:35} {DIALOGUE}: His breath returned to him, Epps starts up the chase again.
{1:10:35 - 1:11:35} {DIALOGUE}: Solomon runs on out of reach.
{1:10:35 - 1:11:35} {DIALOGUE}: Shortly, Epps again stops, gets his breath... And now in what should be quite comical, Epps again runs after Solomon.
{1:10:35 - 1:11:35} {DIALOGUE}: Again, Epps's vigor leaves him before he can even get close to the slave.

{1:11:36 - 1:12:7} {DIALOGUE}: Cautiously, Solomon moves close, but not too close.
{1:11:36 - 1:12:7} {DIALOGUE}: As Solomon draws within striking distance, Epps lunges for him.
{1:11:36 - 1:12:7} {DIALOGUE}: He chases Solomon on until he is again out of breath and once more drops down.

{1:11:36 - 1:12:7} {DIALOGUE}: Sort of.

{1:12:40 - 1:16:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When that fails, he punches her which only leads to him taking up his whip and lashing Patsey MERCILESSLY.

{1:22:50 - 1:23:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We can see Anna moving toward climax and eventual release.
{1:22:50 - 1:23:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But more - or substantially less - than joyous sex, it is really just a drug-like inoculation against reality.
{1:22:50 - 1:23:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But the feeling quickly fades.

{1:50:41 - 1:51:29} {DIALOGUE}: What else can he do?
{1:50:41 - 1:51:29} {DIALOGUE}: Solomon begins to whip, to truly whip Patsey.
{1:50:41 - 1:51:29} {DIALOGUE}: Her back welts, then tears... Patsey screams in agony.
{1:50:41 - 1:51:29} {DIALOGUE}: Solomon strikes again and again... After a full thirty lashes Solomon looks to Epps, who is not satisfied.

{1:52:11 - 1:52:23} {DIALOGUE}: Though Epps fronts rage, there should be underlying anguish for what he has done to his beloved Pats.

{1:52:33 - 1:55:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: From the amount of work that's been done on it, it should be obvious that days have now passed.
{1:52:33 - 1:55:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon makes a cautious approach to Bass.
{1:52:33 - 1:55:3} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As casually as he can he inquires:

{1:55:24 - 1:55:29} {DIALOGUE}: Buffalo and Rochester and Albany, and can tell you the names of the villages on the Erie canal and the Champlain canal.

{1:56:32 - 1:57:7} {DIALOGUE}: Bass looks at Solomon, holding his gaze for more than a prolonged beat.
{1:56:32 - 1:57:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON (CONT'D)
{1:56:32 - 1:57:7} {DIALOGUE}: My daughter Margaret is possibly now 19 and my son Alonzo, 16.
{1:56:32 - 1:57:7} {DIALOGUE}: I miss them so.
{1:57:4 - 1:57:7} {DIALOGUE}: It would be an unspeakable happiness to clasp my wife and my family again.
{1:57:4 - 1:57:25} {DIALOGUE}: Bass hands Solomon an end of a long plank of wood and looks over his shoulder, as if to camouflage the conversation by work.
{1:57:4 - 1:57:25} {DIALOGUE}: They both lift it toward the floorboards.
{1:57:4 - 1:57:25} {DIALOGUE}: Finally Bass speaks.

{1:57:25 - 1:57:28} {DIALOGUE}: My freedom is everything.
{1:57:29 - 1:57:33} {DIALOGUE}: The fact that I can walk out of here tomorrow gives me most pleasure.
{1:57:29 - 1:57:38} {DIALOGUE}: I see the aching in your eyes, the pain of not being attached to your loved ones.
{1:57:36 - 1:57:38} {DIALOGUE}: My life doesn't mean much to anyone, but it seems your life means a lot to a lot of people.

{1:57:55 - 1:57:57} {DIALOGUE}: Not just for you, but for me.
{1:57:55 - 1:58:14} {DIALOGUE}: They continue working, fixing the floorboards in unison.
