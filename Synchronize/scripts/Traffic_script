{0:19:17 - 0:19:21} {DIALOGUE}: Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for.

{0:20:30 - 0:20:33} {DIALOGUE}: And when you get into another situation you can't get out of, open the second."
{0:20:35 - 0:20:38} {DIALOGUE}: Soon enough this guy found himself in a tight place.
{0:20:38 - 0:20:44} {DIALOGUE}: So he opened the first letter.
{0:20:38 - 0:20:44} {DIALOGUE}: It said, "Blame everything on me."

{0:24:23 - 0:24:50} {DIALOGUE}: If you manage to seize an inconceivable 50 percent of all drugs coming into this country, you'll still raise the price of coke and heroin less than 3 percent which won't affect drug use at all.
