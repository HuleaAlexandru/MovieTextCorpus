{1:43:49 - 1:43:53} {DIALOGUE}: The only way the Banque Real de Geneve would cooperate with a foreign legal body is if the crime being pursued also happened to be a crime in Switzerland.

{1:43:49 - 1:44:11} {DIALOGUE}: Which is why Mr. Azoff's joke is most appropriate: from a financial standpoint you are now in heaven, and we welcome you.
{1:44:7 - 1:44:11} {DIALOGUE}: If the U.S. Justice Department or FBI or SEC or IRS sent us a subpoena, it would become papier-toillette.

{1:44:14 - 1:44:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JORDAN
{1:44:14 - 1:44:33} {DIALOGUE}: Unless it was an investigation into stock fraud -- which is a crime in Switzerland.

{1:45:0 - 1:45:11} {DIALOGUE}: Problem was: sneaking a U.S. rathole into Switzerland was a chance I couldn't take.
{1:45:7 - 1:45:11} {DIALOGUE}: What I needed was somebody with a European passport.
