{0:10:39 - 0:10:42} {DIALOGUE}: We get up at 5 a.m., hump all day, camp around 4 or 5 p.m., dig foxhole, eat, then put out an all-night ambush or a 3-man listening post in the jungle.
{0:10:46 - 0:10:49} {DIALOGUE}: It's scary cause nobody tells me how to do anything cause I'm new and nobody cares about the new guys, they don't even want to know your name.
{0:10:53 - 0:10:56} {DIALOGUE}: The unwritten rule is a new guy's life isn't worth as much cause he hasn't put his time in yet - and they say if you're gonna get killed in the Nam it's better to get it in the first few weeks, the logic being: you don't suffer that much.
{0:10:53 - 0:11:46} {DIALOGUE}: I can believe that ... If you're lucky you get to stay in the perimeter at night and then you pull a 3-hour guard shift, so maybe you sleep 3-4 hours a night, but you don't really sleep ...

{1:53:1 - 1:54:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Finally there is a certain frustration to his actions; he has taken such great pains to stay alive that the tuition he pays is precisely to stay in this Jungle.
{1:53:1 - 1:54:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Inevitably his time will come - one way or another.
{1:53:1 - 1:54:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His eyes now follow the MEDIVAC CHOPPER upwards, whatever is left of his shrunken soul yearning to go with it.

{1:53:1 - 1:54:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the Chopper rises off the battlefield, Chris, who is sitting at the edge so that he has a full view out the open door, waves back at Rhah.

{1:53:1 - 1:54:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Rhah, at the edge of the treeline, vigorously shakes his walking stick at him, his other hand a fist, waving them, emitting his cry.

{1:53:1 - 1:54:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now the trees, the skyline and the chopper is moving fast over the devestation.
{1:53:1 - 1:54:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The jungle forever locked in his memory, Chris looks back, copious, quiet tears flowing from his eyes.

{1:54:35 - 1:54:39} {DIALOGUE}: I think now, looking back, we did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves - and the enemy was in us ... The war is over for me now, but it will always be there - the rest of my days.

There are times since I have felt like the child born of those two fathers ... but be that as it may, those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning to this life ...
{1:54:35 - 1:55:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The music surges now to its full strength as we replay bits of film with each actor's name listed - some with silly, clowning looks, others sober, haunted.
{1:54:35 - 1:55:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gardner, Tex, King, Rhah, Lerner, Sanderson, Manny, Big Harold - all the boys ... and then Barnes staring quietly into the camera, and lastly Elias - shirt off, bowl of grass in hand, his big, beautiful smile.
