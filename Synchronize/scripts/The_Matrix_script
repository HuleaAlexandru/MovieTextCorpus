{0:3:43 - 0:4:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Trinity begins to jump from one roof to the next, her moverents so clean, gliding in and out of each jump, contrasted to the wild jumps of the cops.

{0:3:43 - 0:4:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The METAL SCREAM of an EL TRAIN is heard and Trinity turns to it, racing for the back of the building.

{0:4:46 - 0:5:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Trinity is running hard as BULLETS WHISTLE past her head.
{0:4:46 - 0:5:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ahead she sees her only chance, 50 feet beyond the point where the train has begun to turn, there is --

{0:4:46 - 0:5:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And she crashes with an EXPLOSION of GLASS and WOOD, then falls onto a back stairwell, tumbling, bouncing down stairs bleeding, broken --
{0:4:46 - 0:5:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But still alive.
{0:4:46 - 0:5:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Through the smashed window, she glimpses Agent Brown, still on the train, his tie and coat whipping in the wind; stone-faced, he touches his ear piece as the train slides him past the window.
{0:4:46 - 0:5:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Trinity tries to move.
{0:4:46 - 0:5:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everything hurts.

{0:5:22 - 0:6:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The telephone booth.
{0:5:22 - 0:6:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Obviously hurt, she starts down the concrete walk, focusing in completely, her pace quickening, as the PHONE begins to RING.
{0:5:22 - 0:6:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Across the street, a garbage truck suddenly u-turns, its TIRES SCREAMING as it accelerates.
{0:5:22 - 0:6:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Trinity sees the headlights on the truck arcing at the telephone booth as if taking aim.
{0:5:22 - 0:6:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gritting through the pain, she races the truck --
{0:5:22 - 0:6:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Slamming into the booth, the headlights blindingly bright, bearing down on the box of Plexiglas just as --

{0:19:2 - 0:19:6} {DIALOGUE}: A man who calls himself Morpheus.
{0:19:2 - 0:19:14} {DIALOGUE}: Whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant to the fact that he is wanted for acts of terrorism in more countries than any other man in the world.
{0:19:11 - 0:19:14} {DIALOGUE}: He is considered by many authorities to be the most dangerous man alive.

{0:19:38 - 0:19:44} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NEO
{0:19:43 - 0:19:44} {DIALOGUE}: Yeah.

{0:20:8 - 0:20:12} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NEO
{0:20:9 - 0:20:12} {DIALOGUE}: You can't scare me with this gestapo crap.

{0:20:58 - 0:22:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: From a case taken out of his suit coat, Smith removes a long, fiber-optic wire tap.

{0:20:58 - 0:22:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Horrified, he watches as the electronic device animates, become an organic creature that resembles a hybrid of an insect and a fluke worm.

{0:20:58 - 0:22:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It CONTINUES RINGING, building pressure in the room, forcing him up out of bed, sucking him in with an almost gravitational force.

{0:22:33 - 0:23:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He flies out from the train, arms windrilling as he falls from, the raised tracks --
{0:22:33 - 0:23:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hurtling towards a busy city street when, out of nowhere, a truck races under him and --

{0:22:33 - 0:23:35} {DIALOGUE}: Listen to me, Neo.

{0:23:33 - 0:24:12} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NEO

{0:23:33 - 0:24:12} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TRINITY
{0:23:33 - 0:24:12} {DIALOGUE}: This has to be done for your protection and ours.
{0:23:33 - 0:24:12} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She seals his eyes shut with the tape.
{0:23:33 - 0:24:12} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TRINITY
{0:23:33 - 0:24:12} {DIALOGUE}: You can't understand right now, but if you're not one of us, you're one of them.

{0:23:33 - 0:24:12} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The back of the van slaps open, revealing a young, skinny man who looks to be still in his teens, wearing an outfit that is a cross between a surgeon and a telephone repair man.
{0:23:33 - 0:24:12} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His name is GIZMO and he smiles lewdly at Trinity, exposing his teeth that are wired with weird-looking braces.
{0:23:33 - 0:24:12} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GIZMO
{0:23:33 - 0:24:12} {DIALOGUE}: Va va va voom.

{0:23:33 - 0:24:12} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TRINITY
{0:23:33 - 0:24:12} {DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{0:23:33 - 0:24:12} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GIZMO

{0:23:33 - 0:24:12} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TRINITY

{0:23:33 - 0:24:12} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He shoulders Neo and hauls him into the van.
{0:23:33 - 0:24:12} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A moment later the green lights of Lower Wacker curve over the tinted windshield as the van rushes through the underworld.

{0:23:33 - 0:24:12} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Neo is strapped down to an ambulance cart, listening nervously as Gizmo gets to work.
{0:23:33 - 0:24:12} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GIZMO
{0:23:33 - 0:24:12} {DIALOGUE}: Okay, first we take a little look under the hood.
{0:23:33 - 0:24:12} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pulls up the goggles hanging at his neck and they blink to life with tiny halogen lights and lenses irising to varying levels of magnification.
{0:23:33 - 0:24:12} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GIZMO
{0:23:33 - 0:24:12} {DIALOGUE}: You're going to feel a little prick.

{0:23:33 - 0:24:12} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TRINITY

{0:24:10 - 0:24:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GIZMO

{0:24:10 - 0:24:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GIZMO

{0:24:10 - 0:24:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Using a device that looks like a miniature speculum, Gizmo inserts a knuckled dental pick.
{0:24:10 - 0:24:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Typing into a calculator keypad wired to the pick, he automates the tip.
{0:24:10 - 0:24:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On the monitor, we watch it telescope out and the end separate into a tiny hooked, metal claw.
{0:24:10 - 0:24:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GIZMO

{0:24:10 - 0:24:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GIZMO
{0:24:10 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: Gotcha!
{0:24:10 - 0:24:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But the bug reacts violently.
{0:24:10 - 0:24:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Neo screams as it wraps itself around the soft tissue web of intestine.
{0:24:10 - 0:24:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GIZMO
{0:24:36 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: Shit.
{0:24:36 - 0:24:42} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TRINITY
{0:24:36 - 0:24:42} {DIALOGUE}: What's happening?
{0:24:36 - 0:24:42} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GIZMO
{0:24:36 - 0:24:42} {DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{0:24:36 - 0:24:42} {DIALOGUE}: They've never done that before.
{0:24:36 - 0:24:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Neo writhes in pain.
{0:24:36 - 0:24:42} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GIZMO

{0:24:36 - 0:24:42} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NEO

{0:24:36 - 0:24:42} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GIZMO
{0:24:36 - 0:24:42} {DIALOGUE}: I got it!
{0:24:36 - 0:24:42} {DIALOGUE}: Maybe we can stun it.
{0:24:36 - 0:24:42} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TRINITY
{0:24:36 - 0:24:42} {DIALOGUE}: Are you crazy?
{0:24:36 - 0:24:42} {DIALOGUE}: That will kill him.
{0:24:36 - 0:24:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We watch Neo, who can't see what they are talking about.
{0:24:36 - 0:24:42} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GIZMO
{0:24:36 - 0:24:42} {DIALOGUE}: It'll work.
{0:24:36 - 0:24:42} {DIALOGUE}: Come on, do it or Hacksaw will.
{0:24:36 - 0:24:42} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NEO
{0:24:36 - 0:24:42} {DIALOGUE}: Do what?
{0:24:36 - 0:24:42} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The instant he hears the word, he knows.
{0:24:36 - 0:24:42} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TRINITY
{0:24:41 - 0:24:42} {DIALOGUE}: Clear.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NEO
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {DIALOGUE}: Oh, shit --
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The cry is frozen in his mouth as the paddles hit his chest.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gizmo wrestles with the bug.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GIZMO
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {DIALOGUE}: Hit him again!
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Again, the electricity convulses through him as Gizmo yanks the speculum out.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GIZMO
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {DIALOGUE}: Got it!
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Trinity touches Neo, who is just beginning to breathe.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She eases the tape off his eyes.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TRINITY
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {DIALOGUE}: Neo, are you okay?
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He nods.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TRINITY
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {DIALOGUE}: It's over.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {DIALOGUE}: We got it.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hanging from the claw pick is the inanimate metal wire- tap.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GIZMO
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {DIALOGUE}: Nasty little bugger, ain't it?
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The van stops in a deserted alley behind a forgotten hotel.

{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TRINITY
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {DIALOGUE}: Thanks for your help, Gizmo.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GIZMO
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {DIALOGUE}: I just hope the man knows what he's doing.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She nods then climbs out of the van.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gizmo ogles the tight leather pants.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GIZMO
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {DIALOGUE}: Goddamn, what I wouldn't give for a copy of that software.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Trinity turns around.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TRINITY
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {DIALOGUE}: Gizmo, you don't have the hardware to handle this software.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He howls with adolescent laughter as the van pulls away.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Trinity turns to Neo.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TRINITY
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {DIALOGUE}: Let's go.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {DIALOGUE}: He's waiting.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is a place of putrefying elegance, a rotting host of urban maggotry.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Trinity leads Neo from the stairwell down the hall of the thirteenth floor.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They stop outside room 1313.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TRINITY
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {DIALOGUE}: This is it.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Neo can hear his own heart pounding.
{0:24:41 - 0:25:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TRINITY
{0:25:31 - 0:25:34} {DIALOGUE}: Let me give one piece of advice.
{0:25:35 - 0:25:36} {DIALOGUE}: Be honest.
{0:25:38 - 0:25:40} {DIALOGUE}: He knows more than you can possibly imagine.
{0:25:38 - 0:25:50} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ROOM 1313
{0:25:38 - 0:25:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Across the room, a dark figure stares out the tall windows veiled with decaying lace.
{0:25:38 - 0:25:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns and his smile lights up the room.
{0:25:38 - 0:25:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:25:49 - 0:25:50} {DIALOGUE}: At last.
{0:25:49 - 0:25:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible behind circular mirrored glasses.
{0:25:49 - 0:25:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He strides to Neo and they shake hands.
{0:25:49 - 0:25:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:25:52 - 0:25:53} {DIALOGUE}: Welcome, Neo.
{0:25:54 - 0:25:56} {DIALOGUE}: As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
{0:25:54 - 0:26:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NEO
{0:26:2 - 0:26:3} {DIALOGUE}: It's an honor.
{0:26:2 - 0:26:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:26:4 - 0:26:7} {DIALOGUE}: Please.
{0:26:4 - 0:26:7} {DIALOGUE}: Come.
{0:26:4 - 0:26:7} {DIALOGUE}: Sit.
{0:26:4 - 0:26:31} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He nods to Trinity.
{0:26:4 - 0:26:31} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:26:4 - 0:26:31} {DIALOGUE}: Thank you, Trinity.
{0:26:4 - 0:26:31} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an adjacent room.
{0:26:4 - 0:26:31} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They sit across from one another in cracked, burgundy- leather chairs.
{0:26:4 - 0:26:31} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:26:28 - 0:26:31} {DIALOGUE}: I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
{0:26:28 - 0:26:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NEO
{0:26:32 - 0:26:33} {DIALOGUE}: You could say that.
{0:26:32 - 0:26:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:26:34 - 0:26:36} {DIALOGUE}: I can see it in your eyes.
{0:26:37 - 0:26:40} {DIALOGUE}: You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.
{0:26:37 - 0:26:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of his lips.
{0:26:37 - 0:26:47} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:26:44 - 0:26:47} {DIALOGUE}: Ironically, this is not far from the truth.
{0:26:44 - 0:26:50} {DIALOGUE}: But I'm getting ahead of myself.
{0:26:44 - 0:26:50} {DIALOGUE}: Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
{0:26:44 - 0:26:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NEO
{0:26:44 - 0:26:50} {DIALOGUE}: You're Morpheus, you're a legend.
{0:26:44 - 0:26:50} {DIALOGUE}: Most hackers would die to meet you.
{0:26:44 - 0:26:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:26:44 - 0:26:50} {DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{0:26:44 - 0:26:50} {DIALOGUE}: Thank you.
{0:26:44 - 0:26:50} {DIALOGUE}: But I think we both know there's more to it than that.
{0:26:47 - 0:26:50} {DIALOGUE}: Do you believe in fate, Neo?
{0:26:47 - 0:26:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NEO
{0:26:47 - 0:26:52} {DIALOGUE}: No.
{0:26:47 - 0:26:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:26:51 - 0:26:52} {DIALOGUE}: Why not?
{0:26:51 - 0:26:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NEO
{0:26:53 - 0:26:56} {DIALOGUE}: Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
{0:26:53 - 0:27:0} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:26:57 - 0:27:0} {DIALOGUE}: I know exactly what you mean.
{0:26:57 - 0:27:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Again, that smile that could cut glass.
{0:26:57 - 0:27:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:27:4 - 0:27:7} {DIALOGUE}: Let me tell you why you are here.
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {DIALOGUE}: You are here because you have the gift.
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NEO
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {DIALOGUE}: What gift?
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {DIALOGUE}: I've watched you, Neo.
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {DIALOGUE}: You do not use a computer like a tool.
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {DIALOGUE}: You use it like it was part of yourself.
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {DIALOGUE}: What you can do inside a computer is not normal.
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {DIALOGUE}: I know.
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {DIALOGUE}: I've seen it.
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {DIALOGUE}: What you do is magic.
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Neo shrugs.
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NEO
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {DIALOGUE}: It's not magic.
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {DIALOGUE}: But it is, Neo.
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {DIALOGUE}: It is.
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {DIALOGUE}: How else would you describe what has been happening to you?
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He leans forward.
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {DIALOGUE}: We are trained in this world to accept only what is rational and logical.
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {DIALOGUE}: Have you ever wondered why?
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Neo shakes his head.
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {DIALOGUE}: As children, we do not separate the possible from the impossible which is why the younger a mind is the easier it is to free while a mind like yours can be very difficult.
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NEO
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {DIALOGUE}: Free from what?
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {DIALOGUE}: From the Matrix.
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Neo locks at his eyes but only sees a reflection of himself.
{0:27:4 - 0:27:41} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:27:39 - 0:27:41} {DIALOGUE}: Do you want to know what it is, Neo?
{0:27:39 - 0:27:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Neo swallows and nods his head.
{0:27:39 - 0:27:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:27:39 - 0:27:55} {DIALOGUE}: It's that feeling you have had all your life.
{0:27:39 - 0:27:55} {DIALOGUE}: That feeling that something was wrong with the world.
{0:27:39 - 0:27:55} {DIALOGUE}: You don't know what it is but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad, driving you to me.
{0:27:39 - 0:27:55} {DIALOGUE}: But what is it?

{0:38:26 - 0:38:27} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With the TINKLING of GLASS, shimmering snowflakes of electric-blinking mercury fall, hit the ground, and fade.
{0:38:26 - 0:38:27} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks at his hand; fingers distended into mirrored icicles that begin to melt rapidly, dripping, running like wax down his fingers, spreading across his palms where he sees his face reflected.

{0:38:26 - 0:38:27} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The mirror gel seems to come to life, racing, crawling up his arns like hundreds of insects.

{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Neo's body arches in agony and we are pulled like we were pulled into the holes of the phone

{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Pressing up, the surface distends, stretching like a red rubber coccon.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Unable to breathe, he fights wildly to stand, clawing at the thinning elastic shroud --
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Until it ruptures, a hole widening around his mouth as he sucks for air.

{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dizzy, nauseous, he waits for his vision to focus.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is standing in an oval capsule of clear alloy filled with red gelatin, the surface of which has solidified like curdled milk.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The IVs in his arms are plugged into outlets that appear to be grafted to his flesh.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He feels the weight of another cable and reaches to the back of his head where he finds an enormous coaxial plugged and locked into the base of his skull.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He tries to pull it out but it would be easier to pull off a finger.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: To either side he sees other tube-shaped pods filled with red gelatin; beneath the wax-like surface, pale and motionless, he sees other human beings.

{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All connected to a center core, each capsule like a red, dimly glowing petal attached to a black metal stem.

{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Towers of glowing petals spiral up to incomprehensible heights, disappearing down into a dim murk like an underwater abyss.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His sight is blurred and warped, exaggerating the intensity of the vision.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The sound of the PLANT is like the sound of the ocean heard from inside the belly of Leviathan.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Below Neo, a petal detaches from the stem, bearing away the body of an old man like an automated barge even as a new pod rises up and plugs itself into the empty space.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Inside the new capsule, its surface more translucent and pinkish in color, Neo sees a small baby.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: From above, a machine drops directly in front of Neo.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He swallows his scream as it seems to stare at him.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is almost insect-like in its design; beautiful housings of alloyed metal covering organic-like systems of hard and soft polymers.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A black particle beam washes over Neo, he reacts in pain as the scanner seems to expose the nervous system wired to the coaxial cable at his cerebral cortex.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At the back of the neck, the cable lock spins and opens, disengaging.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The cable pulls itself free, a long clear plastic needle and cerebrum-chip slides from the anterior of Neols skull with an ooze of blood and spinal fluid.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The other connective hoses snap free and snake away as --
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The back of the unit opens and a tremendous vacuum, like an airplane door opening, sucks the gelatin and then Neo into a black hole.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. WASTE LINE
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The pipe is a waste disposal system and Neo falls, sliding with the clot of gelatin.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Banking through pipe spirals and elbows, flushing up through grease traps clogged with cily clunps of cellulite.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Neo begins to drown when he is suddenly snatched from the flow of waste.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The metallic cable then lifts, pulling him up into the belly of the futuristic flying nachine, hovering inside the sewer main line.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. HOVERCRAFT

{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS

{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NEO

{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: It's a hovercraft.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: Small like a submarine.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: It's dark.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: It's cramped and cold.

{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Vines of coaxial hang and snake to and from huge monolithic battery slabs, a black portable satellite dish and banks of little systems and computer monitors.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At the center of the web, there are six ectoskeleton chairs made of a poly-alloy frame and suspension harness.

{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS

{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS

{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There are several disturbing NOISES as he works the needle in.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We MOVE IN as Neo's shoulders bunch and his face tightens into a grimace until a loud CLICK fires and his ears pop like when you equalize them underwater.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He relaxes, opening his eyes as we pull back to a feeling of weightlessness inside another place --
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. CONSTRUCT
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Neo is standing in an empty, blank-white space.

{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: Wild, isn't it?

{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NEO
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: This isn't real?
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: What is real?
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: How do you define real?
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.

{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: This is the Chicago you know.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: Chicago as it was at the end of the twentieth century.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: This Chicago exists only as part of a neural-interactive simulation that we call the Matrix.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We GLIDE AT the television as he changes the channel.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: You have been living inside Baulliaurd's vision, inside the map, not the territory.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: This is Chicago as it exists today.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The sky is an endless sea of black and green bile.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The earth, scorched and split like burnt flesh, spreads out beneath us as we ENTER the television.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS

{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In the distance, we see the ruins of a future Chicago protruding from the wasteland like the blackened ribs of a long-dead corpse.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: We are, right now, miles below the earth's surface.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: The only place humans can survive outside the Matrix is underground.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Still MOVING, we TURN and find Neo and Morpheus; the chairs now sitting in the middle of the black desert.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dizzy, Neo holds onto the chair.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NEO
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: What happened?
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: It started early in the twenty- first century, with the birth of artificial intelligence, a singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In his sunglasses, we see storm clouds gather.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: At first all they wanted was to be treated as equals, entitled to the same human inalienable rights.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: Whatever they were given, it was not enough.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In the circular window of the glasses, EXPLOSIONS light up a bloody battle field.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: We don't know who struck first.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: Us or them.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: But sometime at the end of the twenty-first century the battle was joined.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We MOVE INTO his glasses and the war surrounds us.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS

{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At last we see the Sentinels; killing machines that are at once terrifying and beautiful.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They have an organic architecture like a microbiotic organism, that is perpetually in motion.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Sentinel cracks the body armor of a soldier, splitting open the soft, stearing meat inside.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: It scorched and burned the sky.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: Without the sun, the machines sought out a new energy source to survive.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Sentinel locks up, as heat lightning of black ink bursts against the sky, spreading into a permanent cloud of stain.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: They discovered a new form of fusion.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: All that was required to initiate the reaction was a small electric charge.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: Throughout human history we have been dependent on machines to survive.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We return to the power plant that Neo escaped from where we see human beings looking almost blissful in their gelatin cocoons.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: The human body generates more bio- electricity than a 120-volt battery and over 25,000 B.T.U.'s of body heat.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Outside, spreading all around the power plant, beneath a breathing greenhouse, are the growing fields.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: We are, as an energy source, easily renewable and completely recyclable, the dead liquified and fed intravenously to the living.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Huge farm-like reapers are harvesting the crop.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: All they needed to control this new battery was something to occupy our mind.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see inside a clear tubular husk.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Floating in viscous fluid, there is a human fetus; its soft skull already growing around the brain-jack.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: And so they built a prison out of our past, wired it to our brains and turned us into slaves.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We PULL BACK to find the image is now on the television and we are again inside the white space of the Construct.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NEO

{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: I just said that it would be the truth.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The room without walls begins to spin.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NEO
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: Stop!

{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: Don't touch me!
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {DIALOGUE}: Get away from me!
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On his hands and knees, he reels as the world spins.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sweat pours off him as a pressure builds inside his skull as if his brian had been put into a centrifuge.
{0:44:14 - 0:44:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CYPHER

{0:44:36 - 0:44:44} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:44:36 - 0:44:44} {DIALOGUE}: No.
{0:44:43 - 0:44:44} {DIALOGUE}: But if you could, would you really want to?
{0:44:43 - 0:44:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Neo isn't sure of that answer.
{0:44:43 - 0:44:48} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:44:47 - 0:44:48} {DIALOGUE}: I feel that I owe you an apology.
{0:44:51 - 0:44:54} {DIALOGUE}: There is a rule that we do not free a mind once it reaches a certain age.
{0:44:54 - 0:44:55} {DIALOGUE}: It is dangerous.
{0:44:56 - 0:44:57} {DIALOGUE}: They have trouble letting go.
{0:44:56 - 0:45:0} {DIALOGUE}: Their mind turns against them.
{0:44:58 - 0:45:0} {DIALOGUE}: I've seen it happen.
{0:44:58 - 0:45:18} {DIALOGUE}: I broke the rule because I had to.
{0:44:58 - 0:45:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stares into the darkness, confessing as much to himself as Neo.
{0:44:58 - 0:45:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:45:14 - 0:45:18} {DIALOGUE}: When the Matrix was first built there was a man born inside that had the ability to change what he wanted, to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.
{0:45:14 - 0:45:49} {DIALOGUE}: It was this man that freed the first of us and taught us the secret of the war; control the Matrix and you control the future.

{0:45:14 - 0:45:49} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:45:47 - 0:45:49} {DIALOGUE}: When he died, the Oracle at the temple of Zion prophesied his return and envisioned an end to the war and freedom for our people.
{0:45:58 - 0:46:3} {DIALOGUE}: That is why there are those of us that have spent our entire lives searching the Matrix, looking for him.
{0:45:58 - 0:46:19} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Neo can feel his eyes on him.
{0:45:58 - 0:46:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:45:58 - 0:46:19} {DIALOGUE}: I did what I did, because I believe we have been brought here for a reason, Neo.

{0:45:58 - 0:46:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: NEO

{0:45:58 - 0:46:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MORPHEUS
{0:46:18 - 0:46:19} {DIALOGUE}: Get some rest.
