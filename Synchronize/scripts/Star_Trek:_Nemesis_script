{0:0:0 - 0:2:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Their hushed, urgent tones denote the gravity of their discussion.
{0:0:0 - 0:2:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We can't make out the words but there is no doubt what they are talking about.
{0:0:0 - 0:2:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The three year old HUMAN BOY who stands before them.

{0:0:0 - 0:2:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She glances to the familiar Romulan crest that dominates one wall of the chamber: a ferocious bird-of-prey holding two planets, one in either claw.

{0:0:0 - 0:2:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: PRAETOR HIREN -- the head of the Romulan government -- presiding over the Senate from a throne-like chair.

{0:0:0 - 0:2:34} {DIALOGUE}: ... but if we hesitate we'll lose this important source of dilithium.

{0:0:0 - 0:2:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SENATOR 2
{0:0:0 - 0:2:34} {DIALOGUE}: Praetor, I recommend we dispatch a diplomatic mission to Celes II to open negotiations.

{0:0:0 - 0:2:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Praetor Hiren glances to her.
{0:0:0 - 0:2:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PRAETOR
{0:0:0 - 0:2:34} {DIALOGUE}: Senator Tal'Aura, you disagree with the motion.
{0:0:0 - 0:2:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TAL'AURA
{0:2:30 - 0:2:34} {DIALOGUE}: No, sir.
{0:2:30 - 0:2:50} {DIALOGUE}: I would say "negotiation" is to be advised.
{0:2:30 - 0:2:50} {DIALOGUE}: I support all "diplomatic" overtures.
{0:2:48 - 0:2:50} {DIALOGUE}: But if you will excuse me, Praetor, I have an appointment with the Tholian ambassador.
{0:2:48 - 0:3:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Praetor nods.
{0:2:48 - 0:3:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Tal'Aura stands and leaves the chamber... but she had left something behind on her desk.
{0:2:48 - 0:3:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A small, silver box with unusual etchings on the surface.
{0:2:48 - 0:3:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The discussion continues as we focus on the silver box...
{0:2:48 - 0:3:4} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PRAETOR
{0:2:59 - 0:3:4} {DIALOGUE}: Then I will call for a vote on the motion to open trade negotiations with Celes II...

{0:2:59 - 0:3:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The silver box is moving.
{0:2:59 - 0:3:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Senator watches, amazed, as the box begins to slowly fold open.
{0:2:59 - 0:3:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then "legs" appear.
{0:2:59 - 0:3:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The box unfolds like a spider, standing on its legs.
{0:2:59 - 0:3:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then it is still for a moment.
{0:2:59 - 0:3:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Senator looks at it, puzzled.
{0:2:59 - 0:3:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly -- a bright beam of green light shoots up from the spider -- the Senators are stunned -- the beam shoots to the high domed ceiling of the chamber and then cascades around the interior of the room, enveloping everything in a glowing shroud of green energy.
{0:2:59 - 0:3:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In a way, it is bizarrely beautiful.
{0:2:59 - 0:3:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then just as suddenly the light disappears.
{0:2:59 - 0:3:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A moment of silence.
{0:2:59 - 0:3:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Praetor and Senators are baffled.
{0:2:59 - 0:3:44} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PRAETOR
{0:2:59 - 0:3:44} {DIALOGUE}: Would someone please tell me what that was?
{0:2:59 - 0:3:44} {META_DATA}: (he turns to a guard)
{0:3:43 - 0:3:44} {DIALOGUE}: Alert security --

{0:3:43 - 0:4:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PRAETOR
{0:3:43 - 0:4:18} {DIALOGUE}: -- and have them run a --
{0:3:43 - 0:4:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Praetor stops suddenly -- as the flesh begins to melt from his face.
{0:3:43 - 0:4:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Every bit of organic matter in the chamber decays.
{0:3:43 - 0:4:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Flesh melts from bones while the Senators scream in agony.
{0:3:43 - 0:4:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Every living thing in the chamber is dead within ten seconds.
{0:3:43 - 0:4:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A stunning moment of silence as we take in the carnage.
{0:3:43 - 0:4:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then a transporter effect ripples around the spider-weapon.
{0:3:43 - 0:4:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It disappears.
{0:3:43 - 0:4:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And the Romulan Senate is no more.

{0:3:43 - 0:4:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Even stern.
{0:3:43 - 0:4:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His white dress uniform is buttoned tightly to the neck.
{0:3:43 - 0:4:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks at us evenly and then utters the word that has been the watch cry for his entire life as a Starfleet officer.
{0:3:43 - 0:4:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:4:17 - 0:4:18} {DIALOGUE}: Duty...
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He lets the word resonate and then continues.
{0:4:17 - 0:4:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:4:19 - 0:4:23} {DIALOGUE}: A starship captain's life is filled with solemn duty.
{0:4:24 - 0:4:26} {DIALOGUE}: I have commanded men in battle.

{0:4:34 - 0:4:37} {DIALOGUE}: I have represented the Federation in first contact with twenty-seven alien species.
{0:4:37 - 0:4:41} {DIALOGUE}: But none of this compares to my solemn duty as... Best man.
{0:4:37 - 0:4:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Uproarious laughter.
{0:4:37 - 0:4:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We pull back to reveal the wedding reception of WILL RIKER and DEANNA TROI.
{0:4:37 - 0:4:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Enterprise CREW is gathered with invited GUESTS, some from other "Star Trek" series.
{0:4:37 - 0:4:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riker and Deanna sit at the center of a long table.
{0:4:37 - 0:4:57} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:4:52 - 0:4:57} {DIALOGUE}: Now, I know that on an occasion such as this: it is expected that I be gracious and fulsome with praise on the wonders of this blessed union... But have you two considered what you're doing to?
{0:5:6 - 0:5:8} {DIALOGUE}: This is all a damned inconvenience...
{0:5:6 - 0:5:50} {META_DATA}: (laughter from the crowd)
{0:5:6 - 0:5:50} {DIALOGUE}: While you're happily settling in on the Titan, I'll have to train a new first officer; no doubt a stern martinet who'll quote the rule book at me and never... ever... allow me to go on away missions.
{0:5:6 - 0:5:50} {META_DATA}: (laughter)
{0:5:6 - 0:5:50} {DIALOGUE}: ... Then there's the matter of my new counselor.
{0:5:6 - 0:5:50} {DIALOGUE}: Undoubtedly some soft-spoken, willowy thing who'll be probing into my darkest psyche as she nods her head and coos sympathetically.
{0:5:6 - 0:5:50} {DIALOGUE}: Isn't that right, Deanna?
{0:5:6 - 0:5:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Deanna nods her head and coos sympathetically.
{0:5:6 - 0:5:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hearty, wonderful LAUGHTER!
{0:5:6 - 0:5:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:5:6 - 0:5:50} {DIALOGUE}: I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you.
{0:5:6 - 0:5:50} {DIALOGUE}: As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical.
{0:5:6 - 0:5:50} {DIALOGUE}: Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole' me?!
{0:5:6 - 0:5:50} {DIALOGUE}: I'll probably get some old battle- axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I don't show up for my physical on time!
{0:5:6 - 0:5:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{0:5:6 - 0:5:50} {DIALOGUE}: It'll serve you right.
{0:5:6 - 0:5:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Laughter, laughter, laughter!

{0:5:6 - 0:5:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:5:6 - 0:5:50} {DIALOGUE}: Really, it's not too late to reconsider.
{0:5:6 - 0:5:50} {DIALOGUE}: No?
{0:5:47 - 0:5:50} {DIALOGUE}: Very well then...
{0:5:47 - 0:5:59} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He smiles and raises his glass, looks at them deeply.
{0:5:47 - 0:5:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:5:54 - 0:5:59} {DIALOGUE}: Will Riker, you have been my trusted right arm for fourteen years; you have helped keep my course true and steady.
{0:6:6 - 0:6:10} {DIALOGUE}: Deanna Troi, you have been my conscience and best guide, the touchstone to the better parts of myself.
{0:6:17 - 0:6:18} {DIALOGUE}: You are my family.
{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {DIALOGUE}: And in proper maritime tradition I wish you full sails and a clear horizon... My friends, make it so.
{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They drink.
{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. EARTH, ALASKA - PAVILION - LATER

{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {META_DATA}: (playfully)
{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {DIALOGUE}: Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {DIALOGUE}: Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {DIALOGUE}: If you start tearing up I promise to beam you out.
{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {DIALOGUE}: Level one medical emergency.
{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {DIALOGUE}: There's no crying in Starfleet.
{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They head off toward Riker and Deanna.
{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Meanwhile, GEORDI LA FORGE sits with his girlfriend.
{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LEAH
{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {DIALOGUE}: I've never seen your Captain so nostalgic.
{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {DIALOGUE}: Maybe he's getting soft in his old age.
{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {META_DATA}: (laughs)
{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {DIALOGUE}: Not likely.

{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {DIALOGUE}: Had us remove the whole bunch of them and put the old ones back in.
{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LEAH
{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {DIALOGUE}: There!

{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI

{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {META_DATA}: (he looks at her, smiles)
{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {DIALOGUE}: Of course, so do I.
{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He kisses her gently as WORF comes to them.
{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Poor Worf is still suffering a bit from the bachelor party.

{0:6:17 - 0:7:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{0:7:5 - 0:7:9} {DIALOGUE}: Romulan ale should be illegal.
{0:7:5 - 0:7:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{0:7:5 - 0:7:16} {DIALOGUE}: It is, old chum.
{0:7:5 - 0:7:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{0:7:5 - 0:7:16} {DIALOGUE}: Then it should be more illegal.
{0:7:5 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He groans and rests his head on the table, acts like he's going to heave.
{0:7:5 - 0:7:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Meanwhile, Riker and Deanna are talking to Picard and Beverly.
{0:7:5 - 0:7:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA

{0:7:13 - 0:7:17} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD

{0:7:13 - 0:7:17} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{0:7:16 - 0:7:17} {DIALOGUE}: And you needn't worry.
{0:7:17 - 0:7:20} {DIALOGUE}: I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
{0:7:17 - 0:7:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:7:20 - 0:7:24} {DIALOGUE}: The hell you will.
{0:7:25 - 0:7:29} {DIALOGUE}: You know too much about me as it is... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.
{0:7:25 - 0:7:32} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER

{0:7:30 - 0:7:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:7:30 - 0:7:53} {DIALOGUE}: Ladies and Gentlemen and invited Tran gendered species... In my study of Terran and Betazoid conjugal rites I have discovered it is traditional to present the "happy couple" with a gift.
{0:7:50 - 0:7:53} {DIALOGUE}: Given Commander Riker's affection for archaic musical forms I have elected to present the following as my gift in honor of their conjugation.
{0:7:50 - 0:8:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riker shoots an amused glance to Deanna.
{0:7:50 - 0:8:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Conjugation?

{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As always, the android's placid, neutral expression still somehow manages to convey his wonder, curiosity and idiosyncratic zest for life.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard arrives with a very old bottle of wine.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: I've been saving this.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: Chateau Picard 2267.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: Batten down the hatches...
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He carefully uncorks the treasured bottle as:
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: They say a vintner's history is in every glass.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: The soil he came from.

{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD

{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA

{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: Sir.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: I understand why it would seem confusing.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: Certain human rituals -- like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: Will and Deanna joining the Titan.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: And this makes you "sad"?
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: Well.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: I suppose it does a bit.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: That is because you have a familiarity with them.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: And, frankly, I envy them as well.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: New worlds to conquer...
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes another sip of wine.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: Seeing Will and Deanna today made me think about some of the choices I've made in my own life.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: Devoting myself to Starfleet... Not marrying or having children... All the choices that led me here.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data thinks about it.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: The choices I made have led me here as well.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: This is the only home I have ever known.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: You never know what's over the horizon, Data.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: Data looks at him; he has never really considered this.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: I would "miss you."
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {META_DATA}: (smiles)
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: Now, you make a toast.

{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: New worlds.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: Yes Data, brave new worlds...

{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SURAN
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: The fleet commanders are nervous.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: They've agreed to remain at their given coordinates and await his orders.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: But they're anxious to know what's going on here.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DONATRA
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: I don't blame them.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: We can't keep them in the dark forever.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A voice, from the shadows:
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VICEROY (V.O.)
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: But in darkness, there is strength.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Donatra and Suran stop.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And the VICEROY steps from the shadows...
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is a terrifying sight A powerful, monstrous alien creature; a tall, ashen-skinned ectomorph who bears a disturbing resemblance to the original Nosferatu.

{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We observe the Romulan crest, an imposing bird-of-prey clutching a planet in either claw, not unlike the KAOS emblem from "Get Smart," that dominates a wall.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As we hear:
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON (V.O.)

{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The entire floor is a large star chart.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: Yet for generations one of those planets has been without a voice.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: We will be silent no longer.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Senator Tal'Aura (the female Senator who planted the weapon in the Senate chamber earlier) and two other ROMULAN COMMANDERS sit.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cadres of Shinzon's fearsome REMAN WARRIORS stand around the chamber.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are his sinister children of the night.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Even more chilling now in the flickering torch light.
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's like something out of Tim Burton.

{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON

{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DONATRA
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: They support your intentions, sir.

{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon looks at her.

{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON

{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {META_DATA}: (he looks at his Reman warriors)
{0:8:21 - 0:8:55} {DIALOGUE}: We came this far alone.

{0:8:55 - 0:9:7} {META_DATA}: (whispers)
{0:8:55 - 0:9:7} {DIALOGUE}: Besides, I've already seen it.
{0:8:55 - 0:9:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{0:8:55 - 0:9:7} {DIALOGUE}: A warrior does not appear without his clothing.
{0:8:55 - 0:9:7} {DIALOGUE}: It leaves him... vulnerable.
{0:8:55 - 0:9:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{0:8:55 - 0:9:7} {DIALOGUE}: I don't think we're going to see much combat on Betazed.
{0:8:55 - 0:9:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{0:8:55 - 0:9:7} {DIALOGUE}: Don't be too sure.
{0:8:55 - 0:9:7} {DIALOGUE}: Mother will be there.

{0:8:55 - 0:9:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard emerges from his Ready Room as:
{0:8:55 - 0:9:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{0:8:55 - 0:9:7} {DIALOGUE}: I won't do it.

{0:8:55 - 0:9:7} {DIALOGUE}: Captain.

{0:9:4 - 0:9:7} {DIALOGUE}: ... naked.
{0:9:4 - 0:9:13} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:9:9 - 0:9:13} {DIALOGUE}: Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you?
{0:9:9 - 0:9:13} {DIALOGUE}: What are you afraid of?
{0:9:9 - 0:9:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Deanna laughs.
{0:9:9 - 0:9:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then a readout on Worf's console attracts his attention:
{0:9:9 - 0:9:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{0:9:18 - 0:9:22} {DIALOGUE}: I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
{0:9:18 - 0:9:27} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:9:24 - 0:9:27} {DIALOGUE}: What sort of signature?
{0:9:24 - 0:9:27} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Worf looks up.
{0:9:24 - 0:9:27} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Glances at Data.
{0:9:24 - 0:9:27} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF

{0:9:37 - 0:9:41} {DIALOGUE}: It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
{0:9:37 - 0:9:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:9:41 - 0:9:43} {DIALOGUE}: What do we know about the planet?
{0:9:41 - 0:9:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{0:9:41 - 0:9:43} {DIALOGUE}: Uncharted.
{0:9:43 - 0:9:46} {DIALOGUE}: We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.

{0:9:43 - 0:9:47} {META_DATA}: (to Data)
{0:9:46 - 0:9:47} {DIALOGUE}: Theories?
{0:9:46 - 0:9:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:9:51 - 0:9:55} {DIALOGUE}: Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
{0:9:51 - 0:10:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{0:9:51 - 0:10:3} {DIALOGUE}: How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
{0:9:51 - 0:10:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:9:51 - 0:10:3} {DIALOGUE}: I thought only me, myself and Lore.

{0:9:51 - 0:10:3} {META_DATA}: (looking at star chart)

{0:10:0 - 0:10:9} {META_DATA}: (looking at star chart)
{0:10:5 - 0:10:9} {DIALOGUE}: Still well on our side...
{0:10:5 - 0:10:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard glances at Data, recognizes the android's deep desire to explore this possible connection to others like himself.
{0:10:5 - 0:10:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:10:12 - 0:10:15} {DIALOGUE}: I think it's worth a look.
{0:10:12 - 0:10:15} {DIALOGUE}: Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
{0:10:12 - 0:10:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{0:10:18 - 0:10:19} {DIALOGUE}: Thank you, sir...

{0:14:27 - 0:15:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gingerly picks it up.
{0:14:27 - 0:15:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The arm responds to being picked up, the hand starts feeling around in the air like something from a horror movie.
{0:14:27 - 0:15:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Worf shudders.
{0:14:27 - 0:15:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He returns to the jeep.

{0:14:27 - 0:15:21} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA

{0:15:17 - 0:15:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:15:17 - 0:15:53} {DIALOGUE}: I think it unlikely you will need your phaser to recover the cranial unit.
{0:15:17 - 0:15:53} {DIALOGUE}: Of course, it could bite you.
{0:15:17 - 0:15:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then they see it.
{0:15:17 - 0:15:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data's head.

{0:16:8 - 0:16:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Worf and Data spin to see...
{0:16:8 - 0:16:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A nomadic tribe of desert ALIENS swarming toward them firing primitive plasma weapons --
{0:16:8 - 0:16:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data and Worf race back down the canyon, toward the jeep -- some open-field running and a bit of phaser action -- Worf firing to distract and slow the aliens, not kill them -- through all of this the head is chattering away blandly:
{0:16:8 - 0:16:48} {CHARACTER_NAME}: HEAD
{0:16:8 - 0:16:48} {DIALOGUE}: I have two arms and ten fingers.
{0:16:8 - 0:16:48} {DIALOGUE}: Do you know where my arms are?

{0:16:8 - 0:16:48} {META_DATA}: (Etc..
{0:16:8 - 0:16:48} {DIALOGUE}: like Threepio in "Empire" when he's strapped to Chewbacca's back.)

{0:16:8 - 0:16:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data, hands free now, quickly incapacitates the aliens around him with a dazzling demonstration of his superior strength and agility.
{0:16:8 - 0:16:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Meanwhile, Worf tucks the head under his arm and sprints like a master running back -- evading aliens and occasionally firing his phaser --
{0:16:8 - 0:16:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are closer to the jeep now -- but they are in trouble -- the swarm of aliens almost overtaking them -- !
{0:16:8 - 0:16:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When a thundering BLAST sends up a shower of debris, stopping the aliens -- Picard is standing in the rear of the jeep, firing the phaser canon.
{0:16:8 - 0:16:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data and Worf climb into the jeep as Picard leaps into the front seat and roars off --

{0:16:46 - 0:16:51} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Worf fires the mounted phaser canon -- blasting away at the aliens, not killing them, just stopping them -- a few dramatic crashes as the alien vehicles overturn --

{0:16:51 - 0:16:54} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA

{0:16:58 - 0:18:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard puts the pedal to the metal and races through the alien vehicles -- weaving in and out, avoiding their fire -- Worf blasts away with the phaser cannon -- an exhilarating adventure --

{0:21:47 - 0:21:50} {DIALOGUE}: Course plotted and laid in...
{0:21:47 - 0:21:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{0:21:47 - 0:21:50} {DIALOGUE}: Romulus?
{0:21:47 - 0:21:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:21:50 - 0:21:53} {DIALOGUE}: I'm afraid the Opal Sea will have to wait, Number One... Engage.
{0:21:50 - 0:22:11} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. ENTERPRISE - SPACE
{0:21:50 - 0:22:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And the Enterprise jumps to high warp -- disappearing in a flash of dazzling light.
{0:21:50 - 0:22:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Yes!
{0:21:50 - 0:22:11} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - DAY
{0:21:50 - 0:22:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data conducts a briefing for the senior officers.
{0:21:50 - 0:22:11} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Monitors currently show an image of Romulus and Remus in orbit around their sun.
{0:21:50 - 0:22:11} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:22:7 - 0:22:11} {DIALOGUE}: As you can see the habitable half of Remus is always in darkness because, like Mercury, one side always faces the sun.
{0:22:11 - 0:22:14} {DIALOGUE}: Due to the extreme temperatures on that half of their world, the Remans live on the dark side of the planet.
{0:22:11 - 0:22:26} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Various grainy and unclear new images appear to illustrate Data's words:
{0:22:11 - 0:22:26} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:22:23 - 0:22:26} {DIALOGUE}: Almost nothing is known about the Reman homeworld, although intelligence scans have proven the existence of dilithium mining and heavy weapons construction.
{0:22:23 - 0:22:33} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Very obscure images of Remans appear, the crew can barely make out the monstrous figures:
{0:22:23 - 0:22:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:22:30 - 0:22:33} {DIALOGUE}: The Remans themselves are considered an undesirable caste in the hierarchy of the Empire.
{0:22:30 - 0:22:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{0:22:33 - 0:22:36} {DIALOGUE}: But they also have the reputation of being formidable warriors.
{0:22:37 - 0:22:40} {DIALOGUE}: In the Dominion War, Reman forces were used as assault troops in the most violent encounters.
{0:22:37 - 0:22:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:22:37 - 0:22:43} {META_DATA}: (grim)
{0:22:41 - 0:22:43} {DIALOGUE}: Cannon fodder.
{0:22:41 - 0:22:47} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{0:22:43 - 0:22:47} {DIALOGUE}: Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor?
{0:22:43 - 0:22:47} {DIALOGUE}: I don't get it.
{0:22:43 - 0:22:49} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{0:22:47 - 0:22:49} {DIALOGUE}: We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
{0:22:47 - 0:22:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:22:47 - 0:22:52} {DIALOGUE}: A coup d'etat?
{0:22:47 - 0:22:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{0:22:50 - 0:22:52} {DIALOGUE}: The Praetor's power has always been the Romulan fleet.
{0:22:53 - 0:22:56} {DIALOGUE}: They must be behind him.
{0:22:53 - 0:22:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard considers this.
{0:22:53 - 0:22:58} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:22:53 - 0:22:58} {META_DATA}: (to Data)
{0:22:56 - 0:22:58} {DIALOGUE}: What have you learned about Shinzon?
{0:22:56 - 0:23:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The images end.
{0:22:56 - 0:23:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There are no images of Shinzon.
{0:22:56 - 0:23:2} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:23:0 - 0:23:2} {DIALOGUE}: Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record.
{0:23:2 - 0:23:5} {DIALOGUE}: We can infer he is relatively young and a capable commander.
{0:23:6 - 0:23:9} {DIALOGUE}: He fought seventeen major engagements in the war.
{0:23:6 - 0:23:9} {DIALOGUE}: All successful.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:11} {DIALOGUE}: Beyond that, we know nothing.
{0:23:9 - 0:23:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:23:11 - 0:23:15} {DIALOGUE}: Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown.
{0:23:17 - 0:23:21} {DIALOGUE}: Keep at it.
{0:23:17 - 0:23:21} {DIALOGUE}: Anything you can give me would be appreciated.
{0:23:17 - 0:23:21} {DIALOGUE}: Dismissed.
{0:23:17 - 0:23:26} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The meeting breaks up.
{0:23:17 - 0:23:26} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING LAB - DAY
{0:23:17 - 0:23:26} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The B-9 stares placidly forward.
{0:23:17 - 0:23:26} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We pull back and discover that computer conduits connect the B-9's head to Data's head.
{0:23:17 - 0:23:26} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi monitors the connection.
{0:23:17 - 0:23:26} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:23:17 - 0:23:26} {DIALOGUE}: At present he serves no useful function.
{0:23:17 - 0:23:26} {DIALOGUE}: Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society.
{0:23:17 - 0:23:26} {DIALOGUE}: I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
{0:23:17 - 0:23:26} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{0:23:22 - 0:23:26} {DIALOGUE}: I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
{0:23:22 - 0:23:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:23:31 - 0:23:34} {DIALOGUE}: Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself.
{0:23:35 - 0:23:40} {DIALOGUE}: If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
{0:23:35 - 0:23:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{0:23:35 - 0:23:50} {DIALOGUE}: He'd have all your memories too.
{0:23:46 - 0:23:50} {DIALOGUE}: You feel comfortable with that?
{0:23:46 - 0:23:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:23:46 - 0:23:50} {DIALOGUE}: I feel nothing, Geordi.
{0:23:51 - 0:23:53} {DIALOGUE}: It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
{0:23:51 - 0:24:0} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{0:23:57 - 0:24:0} {DIALOGUE}: An individual more like you, you mean.
{0:23:57 - 0:24:0} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:23:57 - 0:24:0} {DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{0:23:57 - 0:24:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{0:24:4 - 0:24:7} {DIALOGUE}: Maybe he's not supposed to be like you.
{0:24:7 - 0:24:11} {DIALOGUE}: Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
{0:24:7 - 0:24:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi completes his work
{0:24:7 - 0:24:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{0:24:20 - 0:24:22} {DIALOGUE}: Okay... we're done.
{0:24:20 - 0:24:33} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi removes the computer connections from between their heads.
{0:24:20 - 0:24:33} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He carefully closes the panel in Data's head as:
{0:24:20 - 0:24:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:24:20 - 0:24:33} {META_DATA}: (to B-9)
{0:24:31 - 0:24:33} {DIALOGUE}: Do you know where you are?
{0:24:31 - 0:24:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{0:24:34 - 0:24:37} {DIALOGUE}: I am in a room with lights.
{0:24:34 - 0:24:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks blankly at the console lights.
{0:24:34 - 0:24:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:24:40 - 0:24:43} {DIALOGUE}: Can you remember our father?
{0:24:40 - 0:24:54} {CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{0:24:40 - 0:24:54} {DIALOGUE}: No.
{0:24:40 - 0:24:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data glances to Geordi.
{0:24:40 - 0:24:54} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:24:51 - 0:24:54} {DIALOGUE}: Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
{0:24:51 - 0:25:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{0:24:51 - 0:25:3} {DIALOGUE}: No.
{0:24:51 - 0:25:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:24:51 - 0:25:3} {DIALOGUE}: Is that your final answer?
{0:24:51 - 0:25:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{0:24:51 - 0:25:3} {META_DATA}: (to B-9)
{0:24:51 - 0:25:3} {DIALOGUE}: Do you know my name?
{0:24:51 - 0:25:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{0:24:51 - 0:25:3} {DIALOGUE}: You have a soft voice.
{0:24:51 - 0:25:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{0:24:51 - 0:25:3} {META_DATA}: (gently)
{0:25:0 - 0:25:3} {DIALOGUE}: Data, he's assimilating a lot of programming.
{0:25:4 - 0:25:7} {DIALOGUE}: Remember, he's a prototype, a lot less sophisticated than you are.
{0:25:7 - 0:25:10} {DIALOGUE}: We just don't know if his matrix will be able to adapt.
{0:25:7 - 0:25:12} {DIALOGUE}: Or if he'll be able to retain anything.
{0:25:10 - 0:25:12} {DIALOGUE}: We should give him some time.
{0:25:10 - 0:25:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data has been studying some circuitry in the B-9's neck.
{0:25:10 - 0:25:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:25:13 - 0:25:16} {DIALOGUE}: What purpose does this serve?
{0:25:13 - 0:25:21} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{0:25:13 - 0:25:21} {META_DATA}: (also examining circuitry)
{0:25:19 - 0:25:21} {DIALOGUE}: It seems to be a redundant memory port.
{0:25:22 - 0:25:26} {DIALOGUE}: Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
{0:25:22 - 0:25:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:25:22 - 0:25:33} {DIALOGUE}: Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
{0:25:22 - 0:25:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{0:25:22 - 0:25:33} {DIALOGUE}: It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing.
{0:25:22 - 0:25:33} {DIALOGUE}: Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
{0:25:22 - 0:25:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:25:31 - 0:25:33} {DIALOGUE}: No, I do not mind.
{0:25:31 - 0:25:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data looks at the B-9 with a sort of sadness.
{0:25:31 - 0:25:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:25:31 - 0:25:38} {DIALOGUE}: But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
{0:25:31 - 0:25:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{0:25:31 - 0:25:38} {DIALOGUE}: Don't give up hope, Data.
{0:25:31 - 0:25:38} {DIALOGUE}: I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.
{0:25:31 - 0:25:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:25:31 - 0:25:38} {META_DATA}: (looking at B-9)
{0:25:31 - 0:25:38} {DIALOGUE}: I am not.
{0:25:31 - 0:25:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data stands.
{0:25:31 - 0:25:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The B-9 stands to follow.
{0:25:31 - 0:25:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:25:35 - 0:25:38} {DIALOGUE}: No, remain with Commander La Forge.
{0:25:35 - 0:25:54} {DIALOGUE}: He is going to try to make you well.
{0:25:35 - 0:25:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The B-9 sits.
{0:25:35 - 0:25:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data goes.
{0:25:35 - 0:25:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi watches him go.

{0:25:54 - 0:25:56} {DIALOGUE}: The Enterprise has arrived at Romulus and is waiting at the designated coordinates.
{0:26:0 - 0:26:2} {DIALOGUE}: All our hails have gone unanswered.
{0:26:3 - 0:26:6} {DIALOGUE}: We've been waiting for seventeen hours.
{0:26:3 - 0:26:15} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING
{0:26:3 - 0:26:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crew is tense.
{0:26:3 - 0:26:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Silence.
{0:26:3 - 0:26:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Worf, at tactical, slowly stretches his neck.
{0:26:3 - 0:26:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Trying to release the tension.
{0:26:3 - 0:26:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It cracks.
{0:26:3 - 0:26:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Deanna jumps a bit.
{0:26:3 - 0:26:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{0:26:3 - 0:26:15} {DIALOGUE}: Why don't they answer our hails?
{0:26:3 - 0:26:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:26:3 - 0:26:15} {DIALOGUE}: It's an old psychological strategy, Number One.
{0:26:3 - 0:26:15} {DIALOGUE}: To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
{0:26:3 - 0:26:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{0:26:3 - 0:26:15} {DIALOGUE}: It's working.
{0:26:3 - 0:26:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD

{0:26:12 - 0:26:15} {DIALOGUE}: They're out there, sir.
{0:26:12 - 0:26:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard stands and walks to the viewscreen.
{0:26:12 - 0:26:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He gazes at Romulus below and the black infinity of space beyond.
{0:26:12 - 0:26:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They're out there, Waiting.
{0:26:12 - 0:26:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF

{0:26:33 - 0:26:44} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{0:26:42 - 0:26:44} {DIALOGUE}: Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.
{0:26:42 - 0:26:48} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:26:44 - 0:26:48} {DIALOGUE}: Patience.
{0:26:44 - 0:26:48} {DIALOGUE}: Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation.
{0:26:48 - 0:26:50} {DIALOGUE}: We can wait.
{0:26:48 - 0:26:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:26:48 - 0:26:50} {DIALOGUE}: Captain...
{0:26:48 - 0:26:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And on the viewscreen.
{0:26:48 - 0:26:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon's magnificent Reman Warbird, the SCIMITAR, decloaks directly before the Enterprise.
{0:26:48 - 0:26:50} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. OVER ROMULUS - SPACE
{0:26:48 - 0:26:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Our first sight of this incredible ship is absolutely breathtaking.
{0:26:48 - 0:26:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon's vessel combines the clean lines of the traditional Romulan Warbird with unique weaponry and styling.
{0:26:48 - 0:26:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is huge, easily twice as large as the Enterprise.
{0:26:48 - 0:26:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And it is aggressive.
{0:26:48 - 0:26:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Awesome in its power.
{0:26:48 - 0:26:50} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING
{0:26:48 - 0:26:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crew gapes at the huge ship on the viewscreen.

{0:26:48 - 0:26:50} {META_DATA}: (tense)
{0:26:48 - 0:26:50} {DIALOGUE}: Should I raise shields?
{0:26:48 - 0:26:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:26:48 - 0:26:50} {DIALOGUE}: No!
{0:26:48 - 0:26:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{0:26:48 - 0:26:50} {DIALOGUE}: Captain -- !
{0:26:48 - 0:27:2} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:26:48 - 0:27:2} {META_DATA}: (firm)
{0:26:59 - 0:27:2} {DIALOGUE}: Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
{0:26:59 - 0:27:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{0:26:59 - 0:27:8} {META_DATA}: (quickly analyzing tactical display)

{0:27:4 - 0:27:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{0:27:4 - 0:27:15} {DIALOGUE}: She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
{0:27:4 - 0:27:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:27:4 - 0:27:15} {META_DATA}: (grim)

{0:27:28 - 0:27:32} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:27:30 - 0:27:32} {DIALOGUE}: On screen.
{0:27:30 - 0:27:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And the image on the viewscreen transforms to:
{0:27:30 - 0:27:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon's Viceroy.
{0:27:30 - 0:27:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stands on the Scimitar's bridge.
{0:27:30 - 0:27:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The bridge is as unique as the rest of Shinzon's ship.
{0:27:30 - 0:27:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Instead of the usual mechanical clutter, this bridge is designed with an almost Asian simplicity.
{0:27:30 - 0:27:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Like the rest of Reman design, it is spare and elegant.
{0:27:30 - 0:27:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Since the Remans are more comfortable in the darkness, most of the light comes from the three steadily pulsing warp core relays which dramatically soar up through the floor of the bridge.
{0:27:30 - 0:27:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crew gazes at the bridge and the monstrous features of the viceroy.
{0:27:30 - 0:27:39} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VICEROY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
{0:27:37 - 0:27:39} {DIALOGUE}: Enterprise.

{0:27:45 - 0:27:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VICEROY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
{0:27:45 - 0:27:52} {DIALOGUE}: I am not Shinzon.
{0:27:50 - 0:27:52} {DIALOGUE}: I am his Viceroy.
{0:27:54 - 0:27:56} {DIALOGUE}: We are sending transport coordinates.
{0:27:54 - 0:28:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The transmission ends abruptly.
{0:27:54 - 0:28:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Scimitar reappears on the viewscreen.
{0:27:54 - 0:28:4} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER

{0:28:0 - 0:28:53} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SCIMITAR - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT
{0:28:0 - 0:28:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The away team materializes in the most striking location on Shinzon's ship: a large observation lounge.
{0:28:0 - 0:28:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is a huge, empty chamber.
{0:28:0 - 0:28:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: No furniture.
{0:28:0 - 0:28:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A simple Reman mat on the floor is the only decoration.
{0:28:0 - 0:28:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At the very top of the room there is a large, etched glass dome.
{0:28:0 - 0:28:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is very dark.
{0:28:0 - 0:28:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They turn when Shinzon speaks from the shadows:
{0:28:0 - 0:28:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON (V.O.)
{0:28:51 - 0:28:53} {DIALOGUE}: I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.
{0:28:51 - 0:29:4} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:28:59 - 0:29:4} {DIALOGUE}: Praetor Shinzon?
{0:28:59 - 0:29:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon moves toward them a bit, becoming slightly more illuminated, the low light shining off his golden hair.
{0:28:59 - 0:29:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crew cannot see him clearly in the dim light but it is evident he is human.
{0:28:59 - 0:29:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Assuming that he was Reman, they're surprised by this realization.
{0:28:59 - 0:29:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon just stares at Picard through the darkness for a moment.
{0:28:59 - 0:29:15} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:28:59 - 0:29:15} {DIALOGUE}: Captain Picard... Jean Luc Picard... I don't mean to stare, it's just -- well, you can't imagine how long I've been waiting for this moment.
{0:29:11 - 0:29:15} {DIALOGUE}: I always imagined you taller, isn't that odd?
{0:29:11 - 0:29:21} {META_DATA}: (to Data)
{0:29:18 - 0:29:21} {DIALOGUE}: You may scan me without subterfuge, Commander Data.
{0:29:18 - 0:29:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data scans him with a tricorder as:
{0:29:18 - 0:29:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:29:34 - 0:29:37} {DIALOGUE}: And you're not as we imagined you.
{0:29:34 - 0:29:39} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:29:34 - 0:29:39} {DIALOGUE}: No?
{0:29:34 - 0:29:39} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{0:29:37 - 0:29:39} {DIALOGUE}: You are human.
{0:29:37 - 0:29:47} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON

{0:29:37 - 0:29:47} {META_DATA}: (he speaks in Klingon)
{0:29:37 - 0:29:47} {DIALOGUE}: I greet you as a valiant warrior... and as my brother.
{0:29:37 - 0:29:47} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{0:29:37 - 0:29:47} {META_DATA}: (terse, in Klingon)
{0:29:37 - 0:29:47} {DIALOGUE}: I'll save my greetings for a better brother.
{0:29:37 - 0:29:47} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon laughs, maniacally.
{0:29:37 - 0:29:47} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:29:44 - 0:29:47} {DIALOGUE}: Why have you asked for our presence here?
{0:29:44 - 0:29:51} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon does not answer.
{0:29:44 - 0:29:51} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is staring deeply at Deanna, moans softly.
{0:29:44 - 0:29:51} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:29:49 - 0:29:51} {DIALOGUE}: Praetor?
{0:29:49 - 0:29:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:29:49 - 0:29:56} {META_DATA}: (quietly)
{0:29:51 - 0:29:56} {DIALOGUE}: I've never met a human woman.
{0:29:51 - 0:29:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He slowly moves toward her, still hidden in the shadows.
{0:29:51 - 0:29:56} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA

{0:29:51 - 0:29:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:29:56 - 0:29:59} {DIALOGUE}: Deanna Troi of Betazed.
{0:30:0 - 0:30:4} {DIALOGUE}: Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor.
{0:30:5 - 0:30:9} {DIALOGUE}: All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful.
{0:30:5 - 0:30:12} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{0:30:9 - 0:30:12} {DIALOGUE}: You seem very familiar with our personnel.
{0:30:9 - 0:30:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon moves even closer to Deanna, not taking his eyes from her.
{0:30:9 - 0:30:14} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:30:12 - 0:30:14} {DIALOGUE}: I am, Commander Riker...
{0:30:12 - 0:30:18} {META_DATA}: (to Deanna)
{0:30:16 - 0:30:18} {DIALOGUE}: ... May I touch your hair?
{0:30:16 - 0:30:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:30:16 - 0:30:22} {META_DATA}: (firm)
{0:30:18 - 0:30:22} {DIALOGUE}: Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance.
{0:30:24 - 0:30:28} {DIALOGUE}: If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
{0:30:24 - 0:30:32} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon continues to stare at Deanna.
{0:30:24 - 0:30:32} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is strangely seductive.
{0:30:24 - 0:30:32} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Almost disquieting in its intensity.
{0:30:24 - 0:30:32} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Deanna handles it with grace, her level gaze never leaving his.
{0:30:24 - 0:30:32} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:30:24 - 0:30:32} {META_DATA}: (softly)
{0:30:24 - 0:30:32} {DIALOGUE}: On the world I come from there's no light.
{0:30:24 - 0:30:32} {DIALOGUE}: No sun.
{0:30:24 - 0:30:32} {DIALOGUE}: Beauty isn't important.
{0:30:24 - 0:30:32} {DIALOGUE}: I see now there's a world elsewhere.
{0:30:24 - 0:30:32} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:30:24 - 0:30:32} {DIALOGUE}: Praetor Shinzon.
{0:30:24 - 0:30:32} {DIALOGUE}: We're not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
{0:30:24 - 0:30:32} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:30:24 - 0:30:32} {META_DATA}: (turning back to Picard)
{0:30:29 - 0:30:32} {DIALOGUE}: Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.
{0:30:29 - 0:30:35} {META_DATA}: (he smiles)
{0:30:33 - 0:30:35} {DIALOGUE}: There's so much we have to talk about.
{0:30:33 - 0:30:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:30:35 - 0:30:38} {DIALOGUE}: I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
{0:30:35 - 0:30:40} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:30:38 - 0:30:40} {DIALOGUE}: Unity, Captain!
{0:30:41 - 0:30:45} {DIALOGUE}: Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people.
{0:30:41 - 0:30:51} {DIALOGUE}: Federation and Romulan.
{0:30:41 - 0:30:51} {DIALOGUE}: Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman.
{0:30:48 - 0:30:51} {DIALOGUE}: I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same.
{0:30:52 - 0:30:55} {DIALOGUE}: We want peace.
{0:30:52 - 0:31:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard and the others are stunned.
{0:30:52 - 0:31:4} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:30:52 - 0:31:4} {DIALOGUE}: I want to end the centuries of mistrust.
{0:30:52 - 0:31:4} {DIALOGUE}: I want to be your ally, not your enemy.
{0:30:52 - 0:31:4} {DIALOGUE}: As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
{0:30:52 - 0:31:4} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:30:52 - 0:31:4} {DIALOGUE}: And the Senate supports you?
{0:30:52 - 0:31:4} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:30:52 - 0:31:4} {META_DATA}: (dry)
{0:30:52 - 0:31:4} {DIALOGUE}: I have dissolved the Senate.
{0:30:52 - 0:31:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{0:30:52 - 0:31:4} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:31:0 - 0:31:4} {DIALOGUE}: Right now, you're thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
{0:31:0 - 0:31:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:31:17 - 0:31:18} {DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{0:31:17 - 0:31:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:31:17 - 0:31:18} {DIALOGUE}: And you're wondering why the Scimitar is so well armed.
{0:31:17 - 0:31:18} {DIALOGUE}: Is this the ship of a peacemaker?
{0:31:17 - 0:31:18} {DIALOGUE}: Or a predator?
{0:31:17 - 0:31:18} {DIALOGUE}: (Picard is startled at Shinzon's choice of words) ... But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore.
{0:31:17 - 0:31:18} {DIALOGUE}: Above all, you're trying to decide if you can trust me.
{0:31:17 - 0:31:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:31:17 - 0:31:18} {DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{0:31:17 - 0:31:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:31:18 - 0:31:22} {DIALOGUE}: Then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion.
{0:31:22 - 0:31:25} {DIALOGUE}: Computer, raise lighting four levels.
{0:31:22 - 0:31:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lights shoot up around the room.
{0:31:22 - 0:31:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For the first time the crew can see Shinzon clearly.
{0:31:22 - 0:31:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard actually gasps when he sees Shinzon's face.
{0:31:22 - 0:31:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The rest of the crew doesn't understand his reaction.
{0:31:22 - 0:31:44} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:31:22 - 0:31:44} {DIALOGUE}: Allow me to tell you a story that I hope will clarify my position.
{0:31:40 - 0:31:44} {DIALOGUE}: When I was very young I was stricken with an odd disease.
{0:31:46 - 0:31:49} {DIALOGUE}: I developed a hyper-sensitivity to sound.
{0:31:50 - 0:31:52} {DIALOGUE}: The slightest whisper caused me agony...
{0:31:50 - 0:31:59} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard watches him carefully.
{0:31:50 - 0:31:59} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wary and strangely intense.
{0:31:50 - 0:31:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:31:50 - 0:31:59} {DIALOGUE}: No one knew what to do.
{0:31:55 - 0:31:59} {DIALOGUE}: Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome.
{0:32:4 - 0:32:6} {DIALOGUE}: Do you know of it, Captain?
{0:32:4 - 0:32:17} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:32:4 - 0:32:17} {DIALOGUE}: You know I do.
{0:32:4 - 0:32:17} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crew is dumbfounded at Picard's unusual reaction.
{0:32:4 - 0:32:17} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:32:14 - 0:32:17} {DIALOGUE}: Then you know it's a very rare syndrome.
{0:32:18 - 0:32:19} {DIALOGUE}: Genetic.
{0:32:21 - 0:32:24} {DIALOGUE}: All the male members of my family had it.
{0:32:21 - 0:32:30} {DIALOGUE}: Eventually I was treated.
{0:32:25 - 0:32:30} {DIALOGUE}: Now I can hear as well as you can, Captain.
{0:32:25 - 0:32:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He steps toward Picard who holds his ground.
{0:32:25 - 0:32:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:32:31 - 0:32:34} {DIALOGUE}: I can see as well as you can.
{0:32:35 - 0:32:38} {DIALOGUE}: I can feel everything you feel.
{0:32:35 - 0:32:46} {META_DATA}: (He stops right before Picard)
{0:32:42 - 0:32:46} {DIALOGUE}: In fact, I feel exactly what you feel.
{0:32:47 - 0:32:49} {DIALOGUE}: Don't I, Jean Luc?
{0:32:47 - 0:32:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard stares at him with a mixture of realization and curiosity.
{0:32:47 - 0:32:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is as if Picard is looking into a strange, remembered mirror: Shinzon's face is nearly identical to his at that age.
{0:32:47 - 0:32:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:32:47 - 0:32:55} {DIALOGUE}: Do you trust me now?
{0:32:47 - 0:32:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{0:32:47 - 0:32:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:32:47 - 0:32:55} {DIALOGUE}: We need to talk, just you and I.
{0:32:47 - 0:32:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:32:51 - 0:32:55} {DIALOGUE}: Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow.
{0:32:51 - 0:32:55} {DIALOGUE}: Just the two of us.
{0:32:56 - 0:33:0} {DIALOGUE}: Or just the one of us.
{0:32:56 - 0:33:26} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:32:56 - 0:33:26} {DIALOGUE}: You know I need to verify this.
{0:32:56 - 0:33:26} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:32:56 - 0:33:26} {DIALOGUE}: I know.
{0:32:56 - 0:33:26} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crew is utterly confused.
{0:32:56 - 0:33:26} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Their confusion turns to outright shock when Shinzon calmly pulls out a Reman knife and cuts his arm, drawing a little blood.
{0:32:56 - 0:33:26} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He hands the knife to Data.
{0:32:56 - 0:33:26} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:33:22 - 0:33:26} {DIALOGUE}: Tomorrow then, Captain.
{0:33:22 - 0:33:26} {DIALOGUE}: We have so much to discuss.
{0:33:22 - 0:34:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard touches his communicator pin:
{0:33:22 - 0:34:6} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:33:22 - 0:34:6} {DIALOGUE}: Picard to Enterprise.
{0:33:22 - 0:34:6} {DIALOGUE}: Five to beam out.
{0:33:22 - 0:34:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They dematerialize, the shimmering glow illuminating Shinzon's features.
{0:33:22 - 0:34:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard's eyes never leave Shinzon as the transporter effect ripples around him.
{0:33:22 - 0:34:6} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - DAY
{0:33:22 - 0:34:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beverly stands with Picard, Riker and Deanna.
{0:33:22 - 0:34:6} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Reman knife is under a protonmicroscope and other medical readouts and analysis are visible.
{0:33:22 - 0:34:6} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{0:34:4 - 0:34:6} {DIALOGUE}: There's no doubt, Captain.
{0:34:6 - 0:34:9} {DIALOGUE}: Right down to your regressive strain of Shalaft's Syndrome.
{0:34:9 - 0:34:11} {DIALOGUE}: He's a clone.
{0:34:9 - 0:34:14} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat as the confirmation sinks in.
{0:34:9 - 0:34:14} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:34:9 - 0:34:14} {DIALOGUE}: When was he... created?
{0:34:9 - 0:34:14} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{0:34:9 - 0:34:14} {DIALOGUE}: About twenty-five years ago.
{0:34:11 - 0:34:14} {DIALOGUE}: They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
{0:34:11 - 0:34:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:34:11 - 0:34:19} {META_DATA}: (touching head)
{0:34:11 - 0:34:19} {DIALOGUE}: I think a skin cell's the more likely of the two.
{0:34:11 - 0:34:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{0:34:15 - 0:34:19} {DIALOGUE}: Why?
{0:34:15 - 0:34:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:34:15 - 0:34:19} {DIALOGUE}: Believe me, Number One; I'm going to find out.
{0:34:20 - 0:34:22} {DIALOGUE}: Contact Starfleet Command and inform them of the situation.
{0:34:23 - 0:34:26} {DIALOGUE}: I need to know where the hell he came from.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {DIALOGUE}: Deanna.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He goes, Deanna following.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR - FOLLOWING
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {DIALOGUE}: I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {DIALOGUE}: What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {DIALOGUE}: Is he sincere about wanting peace?
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {META_DATA}: (she stops him)
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {DIALOGUE}: Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than curious about you.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {DIALOGUE}: He very much wants to know you.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {META_DATA}: (she looks at him deeply)
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {DIALOGUE}: The same way you want to know him.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {DIALOGUE}: How could I not?
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {DIALOGUE}: Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {DIALOGUE}: You should resist the urge to think you know him.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {DIALOGUE}: I not only know him, Deanna, I am him... and he is me!
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He goes.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - RIKER AND DEANNA'S CABIN - NIGHT

{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {DIALOGUE}: Will, you need to rest.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {META_DATA}: (he continues to work)
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {DIALOGUE}: As ship's counselor, I'm recommending you get me sleep.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riker tosses a padd on the desk.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Rubs his eyes.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Looks up her.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {DIALOGUE}: Some honeymoon.

{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {DIALOGUE}: We have time.

{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They kiss deeply.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She pulls him across the room and they fall into the bed.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is passionate, erotic.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her arms undulate around him sensually... her fingers snake through his hair, but something is wrong.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riker's hair is now blond.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She starts back, her eyes growing wide.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riker is gone.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She is now embracing Shinzon!
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {DIALOGUE}: Imzadi.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {DIALOGUE}: This is so good.

{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {DIALOGUE}: No!
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He caresses her face...
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {DIALOGUE}: He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {DIALOGUE}: This isn't real.
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {DIALOGUE}: Can you feel my hands... are they real?
{0:34:23 - 0:36:5} {DIALOGUE}: Can you feel my lips, my loins?

{0:47:11 - 0:47:14} {DIALOGUE}: I so wanted to believe Shinzon.
{0:47:15 - 0:47:20} {DIALOGUE}: But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away.
{0:47:22 - 0:47:26} {DIALOGUE}: Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
{0:47:22 - 0:47:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{0:47:27 - 0:47:30} {DIALOGUE}: Is he very much like you were?

{0:49:50 - 0:49:54} {DIALOGUE}: It's accelerating.

{0:52:34 - 0:52:37} {DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{0:52:38 - 0:52:43} {DIALOGUE}: The bait you couldn't refuse.
{0:52:38 - 0:52:43} {DIALOGUE}: I learned there might be an existing prototype from a Cardassian historian, then went to a great deal of trouble to find it and scatter it about on Kolarus III.
{0:52:38 - 0:52:43} {DIALOGUE}: I knew it would pique your curiosity and conveniently make the Enterprise the closest ship to Romulus when I contacted Starfleet.

{0:52:38 - 0:52:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:52:44 - 0:52:46} {DIALOGUE}: Don't be so vain.
{0:52:47 - 0:52:51} {DIALOGUE}: After we found it, we made a few modifications.
{0:52:52 - 0:52:55} {DIALOGUE}: An extra memory port, a hidden transponder.
{0:52:55 - 0:52:59} {DIALOGUE}: Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols.
{0:53:0 - 0:53:3} {DIALOGUE}: I now know the location of your entire fleet...
{0:53:0 - 0:53:8} {META_DATA}: (to B-9)

{0:53:10 - 0:53:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:53:10 - 0:53:18} {DIALOGUE}: Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.
{0:53:10 - 0:53:18} {DIALOGUE}: Or maybe I'll snap its ugly head off.
{0:53:10 - 0:53:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:53:16 - 0:53:18} {DIALOGUE}: What's this all about?
{0:53:16 - 0:53:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:53:18 - 0:53:22} {DIALOGUE}: It's about destiny, Picard.
{0:53:22 - 0:53:26} {DIALOGUE}: About a Reman outcast who --
{0:53:22 - 0:53:26} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:53:22 - 0:53:26} {DIALOGUE}: You're not Reman.
{0:53:22 - 0:53:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{0:53:26 - 0:53:30} {DIALOGUE}: And I'm not quite human.

{1:1:12 - 1:2:22} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. OVER ROMULUS - SPACE
{1:1:12 - 1:2:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But they are too late -- the Scorpion dematerializes --

{1:1:12 - 1:2:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Enterprise dramatically powers forward and up -- rolling over in a great arc going into warp while still upside down.

{1:1:12 - 1:2:22} {DIALOGUE}: The Enterprise is immaterial!
{1:1:12 - 1:2:22} {DIALOGUE}: They won't make it back to Federation space.

{1:2:22 - 1:2:27} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
{1:2:26 - 1:2:27} {DIALOGUE}: And mine is wearing thin, young man!
{1:2:28 - 1:2:30} {DIALOGUE}: We supported you because you promised action.
{1:2:28 - 1:2:47} {DIALOGUE}: And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while --

{1:2:28 - 1:2:47} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{1:2:28 - 1:2:47} {DIALOGUE}: Commander Suran, the games are over.
{1:2:43 - 1:2:47} {DIALOGUE}: In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair.
{1:2:47 - 1:2:49} {DIALOGUE}: Does that satisfy you?
{1:2:47 - 1:2:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
{1:2:47 - 1:2:52} {META_DATA}: (grim)
{1:2:51 - 1:2:52} {DIALOGUE}: For the moment.

{1:2:57 - 1:3:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: TAL'AURA
{1:3:6 - 1:3:8} {DIALOGUE}: What's happening to his face?
{1:3:6 - 1:3:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SURAN
{1:3:6 - 1:3:24} {DIALOGUE}: I want opinions.
{1:3:6 - 1:3:24} {DIALOGUE}: He is clearly out of his mind.
{1:3:6 - 1:3:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SURAN
{1:3:6 - 1:3:24} {DIALOGUE}: But can he complete his mission?
{1:3:6 - 1:3:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DONATRA
{1:3:6 - 1:3:24} {DIALOGUE}: Should he?
{1:3:6 - 1:3:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They look at her.
{1:3:6 - 1:3:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DONATRA
{1:3:21 - 1:3:24} {DIALOGUE}: Are you prepared to have your hands drenched in blood?
{1:3:21 - 1:3:36} {DIALOGUE}: He'll show them no mercy.
{1:3:31 - 1:3:36} {DIALOGUE}: And his sins will mark us all for generations.
{1:3:31 - 1:3:45} {DIALOGUE}: Is that what you truly want, Romulans?
{1:3:31 - 1:3:45} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{1:3:31 - 1:3:45} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DONATRA
{1:3:31 - 1:3:45} {DIALOGUE}: I think you should consider that question now -- or else you may have a lifetime to think about it in the dilithium mines.

{1:3:31 - 1:3:45} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - NIGHT
{1:3:31 - 1:3:45} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beverly sits with Picard and Riker.
{1:3:31 - 1:3:45} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{1:3:41 - 1:3:45} {DIALOGUE}: The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got.
{1:3:45 - 1:3:47} {DIALOGUE}: Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing.
{1:3:53 - 1:3:55} {DIALOGUE}: He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
{1:3:53 - 1:4:0} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:3:53 - 1:4:0} {DIALOGUE}: But the Romulans abandoned the plan...
{1:3:53 - 1:4:0} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{1:3:53 - 1:4:0} {DIALOGUE}: As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated.
{1:3:53 - 1:4:0} {DIALOGUE}: Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age.
{1:3:57 - 1:4:0} {DIALOGUE}: He was engineered to skip thirty years of life.
{1:4:3 - 1:4:6} {DIALOGUE}: But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down.
{1:4:6 - 1:4:7} {DIALOGUE}: He's dying.
{1:4:6 - 1:4:9} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:4:8 - 1:4:9} {DIALOGUE}: Dying?
{1:4:8 - 1:4:14} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{1:4:8 - 1:4:14} {DIALOGUE}: He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.
{1:4:8 - 1:4:14} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PlCARD
{1:4:11 - 1:4:14} {DIALOGUE}: Can anything be done for him?
{1:4:11 - 1:4:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{1:4:16 - 1:4:19} {DIALOGUE}: Not without a complete myelodysplastic infusion from the only donor with compatible DNA.
{1:4:16 - 1:4:30} {DIALOGUE}: But that would mean draining all your blood.
{1:4:16 - 1:4:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{1:4:16 - 1:4:30} {DIALOGUE}: That's why he went to all that trouble to capture you.
{1:4:16 - 1:4:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PlCARD
{1:4:26 - 1:4:30} {DIALOGUE}: How long does he have?
{1:4:26 - 1:4:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{1:4:30 - 1:4:33} {DIALOGUE}: I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
{1:4:30 - 1:4:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard considers this.
{1:4:30 - 1:4:39} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:4:37 - 1:4:39} {DIALOGUE}: Then he'll come for me as a donor.
{1:4:37 - 1:5:8} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - DATA'S CABIN - NIGHT
{1:4:37 - 1:5:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data stands before the B-9.
{1:4:37 - 1:5:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The B-9 has been deactivated, he stands lifeless and immobile.
{1:4:37 - 1:5:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data gazes deeply into his double's identical features.
{1:4:37 - 1:5:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he opens a panel in the B-9's neck and uses a small instrument to activate the android's head.
{1:4:37 - 1:5:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The B-9's eyes spring to life.
{1:4:37 - 1:5:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks at Data.
{1:4:37 - 1:5:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{1:5:7 - 1:5:8} {DIALOGUE}: Brother.
{1:5:8 - 1:5:11} {DIALOGUE}: I cannot move.
{1:5:8 - 1:5:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{1:5:12 - 1:5:16} {DIALOGUE}: No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
{1:5:12 - 1:5:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{1:5:16 - 1:5:18} {DIALOGUE}: Why?
{1:5:16 - 1:5:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{1:5:18 - 1:5:22} {DIALOGUE}: Because you are dangerous.
{1:5:18 - 1:5:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{1:5:18 - 1:5:22} {DIALOGUE}: Why?
{1:5:18 - 1:5:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{1:5:22 - 1:5:24} {DIALOGUE}: You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
{1:5:22 - 1:5:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{1:5:27 - 1:5:30} {DIALOGUE}: I do not understand.
{1:5:27 - 1:5:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{1:5:32 - 1:5:33} {DIALOGUE}: I know.
{1:5:32 - 1:5:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{1:5:32 - 1:5:41} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{1:5:37 - 1:5:41} {DIALOGUE}: Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
{1:5:37 - 1:5:49} {CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{1:5:37 - 1:5:49} {DIALOGUE}: No.
{1:5:37 - 1:5:49} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{1:5:45 - 1:5:49} {DIALOGUE}: Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abilities of his ship?
{1:5:45 - 1:5:54} {CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{1:5:45 - 1:5:54} {DIALOGUE}: No.

{1:5:52 - 1:6:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{1:5:52 - 1:6:7} {DIALOGUE}: No.
{1:6:3 - 1:6:7} {DIALOGUE}: I must deactivate you.
{1:6:3 - 1:6:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{1:6:3 - 1:6:7} {DIALOGUE}: For how long?
{1:6:3 - 1:6:11} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{1:6:9 - 1:6:11} {DIALOGUE}: Indefinitely.
{1:6:9 - 1:6:14} {CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{1:6:13 - 1:6:14} {DIALOGUE}: How long is that?
{1:6:13 - 1:6:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{1:6:13 - 1:6:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data gazes at the B-9 deeply.
{1:6:13 - 1:6:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{1:6:22 - 1:6:24} {DIALOGUE}: A long time, brother.
{1:6:22 - 1:6:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data reaches forward and deactivates his brother.
{1:6:22 - 1:6:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The B-9's eyes lose the spark of life.
{1:6:22 - 1:6:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stands, frozen.
{1:6:22 - 1:6:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data stands before him.

{1:6:22 - 1:6:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard is gathered with his senior officers.
{1:6:22 - 1:6:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A computer display illustrates Geordi's words about the power of Shinzon's weapon.

{1:6:22 - 1:6:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{1:6:26 - 1:6:29} {DIALOGUE}: It's called a Cascading Biogenic Pulse.
{1:6:31 - 1:6:34} {DIALOGUE}: The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits.
{1:6:34 - 1:6:38} {DIALOGUE}: Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
{1:6:34 - 1:6:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:6:34 - 1:6:46} {META_DATA}: (thinking)
{1:6:34 - 1:6:46} {DIALOGUE}: And that's exactly what he's going to do.
{1:6:34 - 1:6:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{1:6:34 - 1:6:46} {DIALOGUE}: Sir?
{1:6:34 - 1:6:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:6:34 - 1:6:46} {DIALOGUE}: His hatred of the Federation is apparent.
{1:6:43 - 1:6:46} {DIALOGUE}: He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason.
{1:6:49 - 1:6:53} {DIALOGUE}: He is going after Earth.
{1:6:49 - 1:6:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{1:6:49 - 1:6:53} {DIALOGUE}: Oh boy.
{1:6:49 - 1:6:53} {DIALOGUE}: Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled...
{1:6:49 - 1:6:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:6:49 - 1:6:53} {DIALOGUE}: And the Romulans invade.
{1:6:49 - 1:6:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{1:6:49 - 1:6:53} {DIALOGUE}: How can you be certain?
{1:6:49 - 1:6:57} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:6:54 - 1:6:57} {DIALOGUE}: I know how he thinks.
{1:6:54 - 1:7:5} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{1:6:54 - 1:7:5} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{1:6:54 - 1:7:5} {META_DATA}: (to Geordi)
{1:7:0 - 1:7:5} {DIALOGUE}: And there's no way to penetrate his cloak?
{1:7:0 - 1:7:11} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{1:7:0 - 1:7:11} {DIALOGUE}: No, sir.
{1:7:0 - 1:7:11} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{1:7:0 - 1:7:11} {META_DATA}: (frustrated)
{1:7:8 - 1:7:11} {DIALOGUE}: He could pass within 10 meters of every ship in Starfleet and they'd never know.
{1:7:8 - 1:7:17} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{1:7:15 - 1:7:17} {DIALOGUE}: But we do have one advantage.
{1:7:15 - 1:7:20} {META_DATA}: (to Picard)
{1:7:17 - 1:7:20} {DIALOGUE}: He needs your blood to live.
{1:7:20 - 1:7:24} {DIALOGUE}: He might come after you first.
{1:7:20 - 1:7:27} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:7:24 - 1:7:27} {DIALOGUE}: I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274.
{1:7:27 - 1:7:29} {DIALOGUE}: Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
{1:7:27 - 1:7:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{1:7:29 - 1:7:33} {DIALOGUE}: Strength in numbers?
{1:7:29 - 1:7:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:7:29 - 1:7:36} {DIALOGUE}: We can only hope so.
{1:7:29 - 1:7:36} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat as he looks at them gravely.
{1:7:29 - 1:7:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:7:34 - 1:7:36} {DIALOGUE}: He can't be allowed to use that weapon.
{1:7:38 - 1:7:40} {DIALOGUE}: All other concerns are secondary.
{1:7:44 - 1:7:46} {DIALOGUE}: Do you understand me?
{1:7:44 - 1:7:53} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riker knows exactly what Picard is saying: the Enterprise is expendable.
{1:7:44 - 1:7:53} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{1:7:52 - 1:7:53} {DIALOGUE}: Yes, sir.

{1:8:36 - 1:8:38} {DIALOGUE}: Captain's Personal Log.
{1:8:36 - 1:8:41} {DIALOGUE}: Supplemental.
{1:8:38 - 1:8:41} {DIALOGUE}: We're heading toward Federation space at maximum warp.
{1:8:43 - 1:8:45} {DIALOGUE}: The crew has responded with the dedication I've come to expect of them.
{1:8:45 - 1:8:49} {DIALOGUE}: And like a thousand other commanders on a thousand other battlefields throughout history, I wait for the dawn.
{1:8:45 - 1:9:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The montage ends as...
