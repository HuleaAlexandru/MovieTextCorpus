{0:3:34 - 0:7:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The strange lightning forms a circular opening in mid-air, and in the sudden flare of light we see a FIGURE in a SPHERE OF ENERGY.

{0:3:34 - 0:7:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Nothing much going on...
{0:3:34 - 0:7:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then the front door opens and a big naked guy strolls in -- that doesn't happen every night.
{0:3:34 - 0:7:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All eyes simultaneously swivel toward Terminator.
{0:3:34 - 0:7:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Its emotionless gaze passes over the customers as it walks calmly through the room.

{0:3:34 - 0:7:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In POV we move past the staring truckers, past the owner and the awestruck WAITRESS, and approach a large nasty-looking biker puffing on a cigar.

{0:3:34 - 0:7:56} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His clothing has been analyzed and deemed suitable...

{0:7:52 - 0:8:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CIGAR BIKER
{0:8:4 - 0:8:7} {DIALOGUE}: You forgot to say please.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He grinds the cigar out on Terminator's chest.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Which produces not the slight reaction of pain.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator calmly, and without expression, grabs Cigar by his meaty upper arm... Cigar screams from the hydraulic grip.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator doesn't see Cigar's friend, behind him, holding his pool cue by the narrow end like a Louisville Slugger.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The heavy send whistles in a powerful swing and CRACKS IN TWO across the back of Terminator's head.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator seems not to notice.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Doesn't even blink.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Without releasing his grip on Cigar, he snaps his arm straight back and grabs Pool Cue by the front of his jacket.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly the heavyset biker finds himself flying through the nearest window.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CRAASSH!
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator hurls Cigar, all 230 pounds of him, clear over the bar, through the serving window into the kitchen, where he lands on the big flat GRILL.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We hear a SOUND like SIZZLING BACON as Cigar screams, flopping jerking.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He rolls off in a smoking heap.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The third biker whips out a knife with a eight-inch blade and slashes at Terminator's face.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator grabs the arcing blade with his bare hand.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Holding it by the razor-sharp blade he jerks is from the guy's hand.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ultra-fast here: He flips it.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Grabs the handle like you're supposed to hold a knife.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Grabs the biker and slams him face-down over the bar.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then brings the knife whistling down, pinning the biker's shoulder to the bar top with his own steel.

{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With his deep-fried fingers he struggles to get out the .45 auto tucked under his leather jacket.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But he can't even hold onto it.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator takes it from him.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Instead of pointing it at him, Terminator carefully examines weapon, analyzing its caliber and operating condition.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator never threatens... that's a human thing.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He just takes.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cigar senses what he must do when the emotionless eyes come back to him.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He slides the keys to his bike across the floor to Terminator's foot.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then painfully starts getting out of his jacket.

{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Without slowing his stride he jerks the knife out.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The guy slumps to the floor, groaning, behind him.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator continues toward the front of the diner, passing Lloyd, the owner.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At the door, he comes abreast of two truckers who sit frozen like a snapshot in mid-bite.
{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: One of the truckers finally nods.

{0:8:4 - 0:9:38} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LLOYD
{0:9:35 - 0:9:38} {DIALOGUE}: I can't let you take the man's wheels, son.
{0:9:38 - 0:9:42} {DIALOGUE}: Now get off or I'll put you down.
{0:9:38 - 0:12:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator turns and considers by coldly.
{0:9:38 - 0:12:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He eases the shifter up into neutral.
{0:9:38 - 0:12:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Rocks the bike onto its kickstand.

{0:9:38 - 0:12:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lloyd starts sweating, trying to decide is he's going to kill a man in cold blood.
{0:9:38 - 0:12:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's still trying to decide when Terminator's hand blurs out like a striking cobra and is somehow suddenly holding the shotgun.
{0:9:38 - 0:12:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lloyd gapes, knowing he's screwed.
{0:9:38 - 0:12:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then... Terminator reaches toward him.
{0:9:38 - 0:12:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Oh shit... And slips the sunglasses out of Lloyd's shirt pocket.
{0:9:38 - 0:12:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Puts them on.

{0:32:2 - 0:38:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It crashes down, 15 feet to the ground, going about 60, hits at an angle and tears into the concrete wall with a hideous grinding of metal.
{0:32:2 - 0:38:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It ricochets back and forth between the walls then, bellowing like a gunshot stegosaurus, it just keep on plowing forward, gathering speed.

{0:32:2 - 0:38:58} {META_DATA}: 47I The truck can't fit on either side. Neither can it stop, at that

{0:32:2 - 0:38:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The figure emerges from the flames.
{0:32:2 - 0:38:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is human-shaped but far from human.
{0:32:2 - 0:38:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A smooth chrome man.
{0:32:2 - 0:38:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Not a servo-mechanism like Terminator is underneath, with its complex hydraulics and cables... this thing is a featureless, liquid chrome surface, bending seamlessly at knees and elbows as it walks.
{0:32:2 - 0:38:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It reminds us of mercury.
{0:32:2 - 0:38:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A mercury man.
{0:32:2 - 0:38:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Its face is simple, unformed.

{0:32:2 - 0:38:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: First the shape and lines of its clothing emerge from the liquid chrome surface, then finer details... buttons, facial features, ears...
{0:32:2 - 0:38:58} {META_DATA}: 47K But it's still al chrome. With its last step, the color returns to
{0:32:2 - 0:38:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: everything.
{0:32:2 - 0:38:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is the cop again... handsome young face, blond hair, mustache.
