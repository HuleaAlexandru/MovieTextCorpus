{0:0:0 - 0:0:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Total darkness.
{0:0:0 - 0:0:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We hear an old man's voice, distinct and in distress.
{0:0:0 - 0:0:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is OLD SALIERI.
{0:0:0 - 0:0:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He uses a mixture of English and occasionally Italian.

{0:0:55 - 0:1:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A faint light illuminates the screen.
{0:0:55 - 0:1:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Flickeringly, we see an eighteenth century balustrade and a flight of stone stairs.
{0:0:55 - 0:1:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We are looking down into the wall of the staircase from the point of view of the landing.
{0:0:55 - 0:1:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Up the stair is coming a branched candlestick held by Salieri's VALET.
{0:0:55 - 0:1:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: By his side is Salieri's COOK, bearing a large dish of sugared cakes and biscuits.
{0:0:55 - 0:1:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Both men are desperately worried: the Valet is thin and middle-aged; the Cook, plump and Italian.
{0:0:55 - 0:1:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is very cold.
{0:0:55 - 0:1:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They wear shawls over their night-dresses and clogs on their feet.
{0:0:55 - 0:1:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They wheeze as they climb.
{0:0:55 - 0:1:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The candles throw their shadows up onto the peeling walls of the house, which is evidently an old one and in bad decay.
{0:0:55 - 0:1:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A cat scuttles swiftly between their bare legs, as they reach the salon door.
{0:0:55 - 0:1:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Valet tries the handle.
{0:0:55 - 0:1:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is locked.
{0:0:55 - 0:1:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Behind it the voice goes on, rising in volume.

{0:0:55 - 0:1:7} {DIALOGUE}: I beg you.
{0:0:55 - 0:1:7} {DIALOGUE}: I beg you!
{0:0:55 - 0:1:7} {DIALOGUE}: Show mercy to a guilty man!
{0:0:55 - 0:1:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Valet knocks gently on the door.
{0:0:55 - 0:1:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The voice stops.
{0:0:55 - 0:1:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VALET
{0:0:55 - 0:1:7} {DIALOGUE}: Open the door, Signore!

{0:1:4 - 0:1:14} {DIALOGUE}: We've brought you something special.
{0:1:11 - 0:1:14} {DIALOGUE}: Something you're going to love.
{0:1:11 - 0:1:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Silence.
{0:1:11 - 0:1:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VALET
{0:1:11 - 0:1:43} {DIALOGUE}: Signore Salieri!
{0:1:40 - 0:1:43} {DIALOGUE}: Open the door.
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: Come now.
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: Be good!
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The voice of Old Salieri continues again, further off now, and louder.
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We hear a noise as if a window is being opened.
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: Mozart!
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: Mozart!

{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: Listen!
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: I confess!
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The two servants look at each other in alarm.
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then the Valet hands the candlestick to the Cook and takes a sugared cake from the dish, scrambling as quickly as he can back down the stairs.
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE SALIERI'S HOUSE - VIENNA - NIGHT
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The street is filled with people: ten cabs with drivers, five children, fifteen adults, two doormen, fifteen dancing couples and a sled and three dogs.
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is a windy night.
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Snow is falling and whirling about.
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: People are passing on foot, holding their cloaks tightly around them.
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Some of them are revelers in fancy dress: they wear masks on their faces or hanging around their necks, as if returning from parties.
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now they are glancing up at the facade of the old house.
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The window above the street is open and Old Salieri stands there calling to the sky: a sharp-featured, white-haired Italian over seventy years old, wearing a stained dressing gown.

{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {META_DATA}: (looking up to the window)
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: That's all right, Signore!
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: He heard you!
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: He forgave you!
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: He wants you to go inside now and shut the window!
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Old Salieri stares down at him.
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Some of the passersby have now stopped and are watching this spectacle.
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VALET
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: Come on, Signore!
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: Look what I have for you!
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: I can't give it to you from down here, can I?
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Old Salieri looks at him in contempt.
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he turns away back into the room, shutting the window with a bang.
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Through the glass, the old man stares down at the group of onlookers in the street.
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They stare back at him in confusion.
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BYSTANDER

{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VALET
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: No one, sir.
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: He'll be all right.
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: Poor man.
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: He's a little unhappy, you know.
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He makes a sign indicating 'crazy,' and goes back inside the house.
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The onlookers keep staring.

{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VALET
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: Did he open?
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Cook, scared, shakes his head: no.

{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VALET
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: Here I am, Signore.
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: Now open the door.

{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VALET
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: Mmmm - this is good!
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: This is the most delicious thing I ever ate, believe me!
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: Signore, you don't know what you're missing!
{0:1:40 - 0:1:50} {DIALOGUE}: Mmmm!

{0:1:46 - 0:5:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VALET
{0:1:46 - 0:5:29} {DIALOGUE}: If you don't open this door, we're going to eat everything.
{0:1:46 - 0:5:29} {DIALOGUE}: There'll be nothing left for you.
{0:1:46 - 0:5:29} {DIALOGUE}: And I'm not going to bring you anything more.
{0:1:46 - 0:5:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks down.
{0:1:46 - 0:5:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: From under the door we see a trickle of blood flowing.
{0:1:46 - 0:5:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In horror, the two men stare at it.
{0:1:46 - 0:5:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The dish of cakes falls from the Cook's hand and shatters.
{0:1:46 - 0:5:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He sets the candlestick down on the floor.
{0:1:46 - 0:5:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Both servants run at the door frantically - once, twice, three times - and the frail lock gives.
{0:1:46 - 0:5:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The door flies open.
{0:1:46 - 0:5:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Immediately, the stormy, frenzied opening of Mozart's Symphony No. 25 (the Little G Minor) begins.

{0:1:46 - 0:5:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They run to him.
{0:1:46 - 0:5:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Barely, we glimpse the room - an old chair, old tables piled with books, a forte- piano, a chamber-pot on the floor - as the Valet and the Cook struggle to lift their old Master, and bind his bleeding throat with a napkin.

{0:1:46 - 0:5:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is DOCTOR GULDEN.
{0:1:46 - 0:5:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He gets in beside his patient.
{0:1:46 - 0:5:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The driver whips up the horse, and the wagon dashes off through the still-falling snow.

{0:22:9 - 0:22:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He throws the door wide open
{0:22:9 - 0:22:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: so that the guests can see into the private apartment where the Archbishop sits - and he can see them.
{0:22:9 - 0:22:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Colloredo is clearly discomfited by this reception of his employee.
{0:22:9 - 0:22:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He smiles and bows uneasily, as they include him in the small ovation.
{0:22:9 - 0:22:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart stands in the corridor, out of the Archbishop's line of sight, bowing and giggling, and encouraging the applause for the Archbishop with conducting gestures.
{0:22:9 - 0:22:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly irritated, Colloredo signs to Arco, who steps forward and shuts the door, ending the applause.

{0:22:9 - 0:22:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns the pages back to the slow movement.
{0:22:9 - 0:22:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Instantly, we again hear its lyrical strains.
{0:22:9 - 0:22:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CU, Salieri, reading the score of the Adagio in helpless fascination.

{0:22:9 - 0:22:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
{0:22:9 - 0:22:55} {DIALOGUE}: Extraordinary!
{0:22:54 - 0:22:55} {DIALOGUE}: On the page it looked nothing.
{0:22:58 - 0:23:2} {DIALOGUE}: The beginning simple, almost comic.
{0:23:5 - 0:23:8} {DIALOGUE}: Just a pulse - bassoons and basset horns - like a rusty squeezebox.
{0:23:26 - 0:23:29} {DIALOGUE}: Then suddenly - high above it - an oboe, a single note, hanging there unwavering, till a clarinet took over and sweetened it into a phrase of such delight!
{0:23:47 - 0:23:51} {DIALOGUE}: This was no composition by a performing monkey!
{0:23:54 - 0:23:57} {DIALOGUE}: This was a music I'd never heard.
{0:24:0 - 0:24:4} {DIALOGUE}: Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing, it had me trembling.
{0:24:6 - 0:24:10} {DIALOGUE}: It seemed to me that I was hearing a voice of God.

{0:24:10 - 0:24:14} {CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

{0:24:13 - 0:24:14} {CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{0:24:13 - 0:24:14} {DIALOGUE}: Why?
{0:24:15 - 0:24:20} {DIALOGUE}: Would God choose an obscene child to be His instrument?
{0:24:21 - 0:24:23} {DIALOGUE}: It was not to be believed!
{0:24:23 - 0:24:28} {DIALOGUE}: This piece had to be an accident.
{0:24:23 - 0:24:28} {DIALOGUE}: It had to be!
{0:24:23 - 0:24:37} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. PALACE DINING ROOM - DAY - 1780'S

{0:24:23 - 0:24:37} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: BARON VON SWIETEN, the Imperial Librarian: a grave but kindly and educated man in his mid-fifties.

{0:24:35 - 0:24:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VON SWIETEN
{0:24:37 - 0:24:43} {DIALOGUE}: He's remarkable, Majesty.
{0:24:37 - 0:24:43} {DIALOGUE}: I heard an extraordinary serious opera of his last month.
{0:24:43 - 0:24:46} {DIALOGUE}: Idomeneo, King of Crete.
{0:24:43 - 0:24:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
{0:24:43 - 0:24:50} {DIALOGUE}: That?
{0:24:47 - 0:24:50} {DIALOGUE}: A most tiresome piece.
{0:24:47 - 0:24:50} {DIALOGUE}: I heard it, too.
{0:24:47 - 0:24:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VON SWIETEN
{0:24:50 - 0:24:52} {DIALOGUE}: Tiresome?

{0:24:53 - 0:24:57} {DIALOGUE}: A young man trying to impress beyond his abilities.

{0:25:4 - 0:25:11} {DIALOGUE}: Ah-ha.
{0:25:8 - 0:25:11} {DIALOGUE}: Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him.
{0:25:11 - 0:25:16} {DIALOGUE}: We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
{0:25:11 - 0:25:21} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VON STRACK
{0:25:11 - 0:25:21} {DIALOGUE}: I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible.
{0:25:11 - 0:25:21} {DIALOGUE}: The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
{0:25:11 - 0:25:21} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPH
{0:25:11 - 0:25:21} {DIALOGUE}: Very small pay, I imagine.
{0:25:16 - 0:25:21} {DIALOGUE}: I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer.
{0:25:21 - 0:25:25} {DIALOGUE}: Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
{0:25:21 - 0:25:26} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VON SWIETEN
{0:25:25 - 0:25:26} {DIALOGUE}: Excellent, sire!
{0:25:25 - 0:25:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
{0:25:27 - 0:25:30} {DIALOGUE}: But not German, I beg your Majesty!

{0:25:35 - 0:25:44} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPH
{0:25:35 - 0:25:44} {DIALOGUE}: Ah-ha.

{0:25:42 - 0:25:49} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VON STRACK
{0:25:45 - 0:25:49} {DIALOGUE}: In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir.

{0:26:1 - 0:26:5} {DIALOGUE}: Majesty, I must agree with Herr Dirretore.
{0:26:1 - 0:26:20} {DIALOGUE}: Opera is an Italian art, solamente.
{0:26:1 - 0:26:20} {DIALOGUE}: German is - scusate - too bruta for singing, too rough.
{0:26:1 - 0:26:20} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPH
{0:26:1 - 0:26:20} {DIALOGUE}: Ah-ha.
{0:26:19 - 0:26:20} {DIALOGUE}: Court Composer, what do you say?
{0:26:19 - 0:26:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SALIERI
{0:26:25 - 0:26:29} {DIALOGUE}: I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty.
{0:26:29 - 0:26:32} {DIALOGUE}: It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
{0:26:29 - 0:26:39} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPH
{0:26:36 - 0:26:39} {DIALOGUE}: You are cattivo, Court Composer.
{0:26:36 - 0:26:46} {META_DATA}: (briskly, to Von Strack)
{0:26:41 - 0:26:46} {DIALOGUE}: I want to meet this young man.

{0:26:47 - 0:27:31} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart takes off the first wig, to reveal his own blonde hair, of which he is extremely proud, and hands it back.

{1:0:28 - 1:0:32} {DIALOGUE}: It was actually beyond belief.
{1:0:39 - 1:0:45} {DIALOGUE}: These were first and only drafts of music yet they showed no corrections of any kind.

{1:0:39 - 1:0:54} {DIALOGUE}: Do you realize what that meant?
{1:0:39 - 1:0:54} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Vogler stares at him.
{1:0:39 - 1:0:54} {CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{1:0:51 - 1:0:54} {DIALOGUE}: He'd simply put down music already finished in his head.
{1:0:54 - 1:1:0} {DIALOGUE}: Page after page of it, as if he was just taking dictation.
{1:1:9 - 1:1:13} {DIALOGUE}: And music finished as no music is ever finished.

{1:1:9 - 1:1:19} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CU, The manuscript in Mozart's handwriting.

{1:1:9 - 1:1:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
{1:1:16 - 1:1:19} {DIALOGUE}: Displace one note and there would be diminishment.
{1:1:23 - 1:1:27} {DIALOGUE}: Displace one phrase, and the structure would fall.
{1:1:31 - 1:1:33} {DIALOGUE}: It was clear to me.
{1:1:34 - 1:1:38} {DIALOGUE}: That sound I had heard in the Archbishop's palace had been no accident.
{1:1:42 - 1:1:47} {DIALOGUE}: Here again was the very voice of God!

{1:1:54 - 1:2:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The music swells.
{1:1:54 - 1:2:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: What we now hear is an amazing collage of great passages from Mozart's music, ravishing to Salieri and to us.
{1:1:54 - 1:2:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Court Composer, oblivious to Constanze, who sits happily chewing chestnuts, her mouth covered in sugar, walks around and around his salon, reading the pages and dropping them on the floor when he is done with them.
{1:1:54 - 1:2:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see his agonized and wondering face: he shudders as if in a rough and tumbling sea; he experiences the point where beauty and great pain coalesce.
{1:1:54 - 1:2:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: More pages fall than he can read, scattering across the floor in a white cascade, as he circles the room.
{1:1:54 - 1:2:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Finally, we hear the tremendous Qui Tollis from the Mass in C Minor.
{1:1:54 - 1:2:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It seems to break over him like a wave and, unable to bear any more of it, he slams the portfolio shut.
{1:1:54 - 1:2:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Instantly, the music breaks off, reverberating in his head.
{1:1:54 - 1:2:21} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stands shaking, staring wildly.

{1:14:31 - 1:14:38} {DIALOGUE}: You give into her now, you'll be sorry later.
{1:14:31 - 1:14:38} {DIALOGUE}: Strudel - play.
{1:14:31 - 1:14:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Silence.
{1:14:31 - 1:14:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The girl sits unmoving.
{1:14:31 - 1:14:38} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Schlumberg bellows:

{1:14:43 - 1:14:45} {DIALOGUE}: Why don't you let me try the instrument?

{1:14:43 - 1:14:59} {DIALOGUE}: I beg you.
{1:14:43 - 1:14:59} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart resumes playing.
{1:14:43 - 1:14:59} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This time it is a lively piece, perhaps the Presto Finale from the K. 450.

{1:14:43 - 1:14:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SCHLUMBERG

{1:14:55 - 1:14:59} {DIALOGUE}: You keep playing.

{1:16:4 - 1:17:7} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. A BUSY STREET IN VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S
{1:16:4 - 1:17:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A cheerful scene.
{1:16:4 - 1:17:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see Mozart strutting and beaming, making his way through the crowd of porters, carriers and hawkers, sellers of sausages and pastries, vendors of hats and ribbons.
{1:16:4 - 1:17:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Horses and carriage clatter past him.
{1:16:4 - 1:17:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His mood is best expressed by a bubbling version of Non piu Andrai played on the forte-piano.
{1:16:4 - 1:17:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Still in the same mood, he enters the door of his own house.
{1:16:4 - 1:17:7} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. MOZART'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY - 1780'S

{1:16:4 - 1:17:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks up the stairs.
{1:16:4 - 1:17:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The grim opening chords from the Overture to Don Giovanni cut across the march from Figaro.
{1:16:4 - 1:17:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: What he sees, looking up the stairs, is a menacing figure in a long, grey cape and dark grey hat, standing on the landing.
{1:16:4 - 1:17:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The light comes from behind the figure so that we see only its silhouette as it unfolds its arms towards Mozart in an alarming gesture of possession.
{1:16:4 - 1:17:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It takes a beat in which the air of sinister mystery is held before Mozart realizes who it is.
{1:16:4 - 1:17:7} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, as the music continues, he hastily sets down the bottle of wine and rushes joyfully up the stairs and hurls himself into the figure's arms.
{1:16:4 - 1:17:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{1:17:5 - 1:17:7} {DIALOGUE}: Papa!

{1:17:5 - 1:17:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A cramped, low-ceilinged little room which nobody has tidied for ages.
{1:17:5 - 1:17:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see music lying everywhere.
{1:17:5 - 1:17:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Also there are many empty wine bottles; musical instruments - among them a mandolin, a viola, a forte-piano with the black and white keys reversed - books and abandoned plates of food.
{1:17:5 - 1:17:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart clasps his father's arms.
{1:17:5 - 1:17:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leopold is now seen as an aging, travel-stained man in clothes that need repair.
{1:17:5 - 1:17:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His face is lined, and he is obviously not in perfect health.
{1:17:5 - 1:17:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART

{1:17:46 - 1:17:55} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart ducks away and fetches his father's bags from the landing.

{1:17:56 - 1:17:59} {DIALOGUE}: Stanzi!
{1:17:56 - 1:17:59} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leopold looks about him at the mess in the room.
{1:17:56 - 1:17:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{1:17:56 - 1:17:59} {DIALOGUE}: Do you always live like this?

{1:18:17 - 1:18:25} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{1:18:21 - 1:18:25} {DIALOGUE}: We'll wait, we'll wait.

{1:19:48 - 1:20:13} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She is wearing a dressing gown and has made a perfunctory attempt to tidy her hair.

{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {DIALOGUE}: My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The jaunty tune of Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein (K.539) sounds through all the following.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is an alternate song from Il Seraglio: a very extroverted tune for baritone and orchestra and a prominent part for bass drum.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The vocal part should be arranged for trumpet.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. STREET IN VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S

{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is a shop where one can buy costumes for masquerades.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is filled with extravagant costumes of various kinds.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wolfgang is wearing a costume, a mask pushed up on his forehead; Constanze is wearing a little white velvet mask.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Amidst the merriment, Leopold is helped by two assistants to put on a dark grey cloak and a dark grey tricorne hat, to which is attached a full mask of dark grey.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Its mouth is cut into a fixed upward smile.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns and looks at his son through this mask.

{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We are in the full whirl of a Masquerade Ball.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Couples are dancing around dressed in fantastic costumes.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The music of Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein increases in volume and persists.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see the musicians thumping it out on a balustrade above the dancers.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A steer is being roasted.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Through the bobbing crowd we see a group, headed by the figure of Bacchus: this is Schikaneder in a Greek costume, wearing vine leaves in his hair.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is accompanied by his usual trio of actresses and three other men.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Constanze as Columbine and Mozart as Harlequin are pulling Leopold by the hand of his dark cloak and smiling mask.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This whole group threads its way across the crowded room and disappears through a door.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As they go, they are watched by Salieri, standing alone in a corner, wearing ordinary evening clothes.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns away hastily to avoid being seen by them.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As soon as they disappear into the far room, Salieri goes quickly to a lady in the corner who is giving guests domino masks off a tray.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He quickly takes a small black mask and puts it on.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. A GROTTO ROOM NEXT DOOR - NIGHT - 1780'S
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A fantastic room designed as a rocky grotto, lit by candles.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A forte-piano to one side is being played by Schikaneder: the music of Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein cross-fades to another tune.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is Vivat Bacchus from Il Seraglio which
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Schikaneder, dressed as Bacchus, is humming as he plays.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The music is actually accompanying a game of Forfeits, which has begun.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Five couples (the group we have just seen) are dancing in the middle of a ring made by nine chairs.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When the music stops they will each have to find a chair, and the one who fails must pay a forfeit.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Constanze is dancing with Leopold; Mozart is dancing with one of the actresses; the two other actresses are dancing with two other gentlemen; and two children dance together - a little boy and a little girl.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The scene is watched by a circle of bystanders; among them - from the doorway - is Salieri.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Schikaneder stops playing.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Immediately the couples scramble for the chairs.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leopold and Constanze meet on the same chair, bumping and pushing at each other to get sole possession of it.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: To the amusement of the people around, the chair over- balances and they both end up on the floor.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Constanze immediately gets up again, sets the chair on its feet, and tries to pretend she was sitting in it all the time.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But Schikaneder calls out from the forte-piano.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SCHIKANEDER
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {DIALOGUE}: No, no!
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {DIALOGUE}: You both lost.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {DIALOGUE}: You both lost.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {DIALOGUE}: You both have to forfeit.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {DIALOGUE}: And the penalty is you must exchange your wigs.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: People are delighted by the idea of this penalty.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The children jump up and down with excitement.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The three actresses immediately surround Leopold, reaching for his hat and mask and wig, whilst he tries to hold on to them.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart takes off Constanze's wig - an absurd affair with side-curls.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Constanze laughingly surrenders it.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {DIALOGUE}: No, please!
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {DIALOGUE}: This is ridiculous!
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {DIALOGUE}: No, please!
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Despite his protests an actress takes off his hat, to which the smiling mask is attached, to reveal his outraged face showing a very different expression underneath.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Another actress snatches off his wig to reveal very sparse hair on the old man's head.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The third actress takes Constanze's wig from Mozart and attempts to put it on his father's head.
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {DIALOGUE}: No, really!
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{1:20:52 - 1:22:20} {META_DATA}: (calling to him)
{1:22:18 - 1:22:20} {DIALOGUE}: This is just a game, Papa.
{1:22:18 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Constanze echoes him with a touch of malice in her voice.
{1:22:18 - 1:22:20} {CHARACTER_NAME}: CONSTANZE
{1:22:18 - 1:22:20} {DIALOGUE}: This is just a game, Papa!
{1:22:18 - 1:22:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Laughingly, the bystanders take it up, especially the children.
{1:22:18 - 1:22:20} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BYSTANDERS
{1:22:18 - 1:22:20} {DIALOGUE}: This is just a game, Papa!
{1:22:18 - 1:23:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Leopold glares furiously about him, the actress succeeds in getting Constanze's wig firmly onto his head.
{1:22:18 - 1:23:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everybody bursts into applause.
{1:22:18 - 1:23:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Delightedly, Constanze puts on Leopold's wig, hat and mask: from the waist up she now looks like a weird parody of Leopold in the smiling grey mask, and he looks like a weird parody of her in the silly feminine wig.
{1:22:18 - 1:23:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Schikaneder starts to play again, and the couples start to dance.
{1:22:18 - 1:23:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leopold angrily takes off Constanze's wig and leaves the circle; his partner, Constanze, is left alone.
{1:22:18 - 1:23:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Seeing this, Mozart leaves his partner and catches his father entreatingly by the arm.
{1:22:18 - 1:23:4} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{1:22:18 - 1:23:4} {DIALOGUE}: Oh no, Papa, please!

{1:22:18 - 1:23:4} {DIALOGUE}: Come on.
{1:22:18 - 1:23:4} {DIALOGUE}: Here, take mine.
{1:22:18 - 1:23:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes off his own wig and puts it on Leopold's uncovered head.
{1:22:18 - 1:23:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The effect, if not as ridiculous, is still somewhat bizarre, since Wolfgang favours fairly elaborate wigs.
{1:22:18 - 1:23:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes Constanze's wig from his father.
{1:22:18 - 1:23:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As this happens, the music stops again.
{1:22:18 - 1:23:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart gently pushes his father down onto a nearby chair; the others scramble for the other chairs; and he is left as the Odd Man Out.
{1:22:18 - 1:23:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He giggles.
{1:22:18 - 1:23:4} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Schikaneder calls out to Leopold from the keyboard.
{1:22:18 - 1:23:4} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SCHIKANEDER
{1:22:59 - 1:23:4} {DIALOGUE}: Herr Mozart, why don't you name your son's penalty?

{1:23:6 - 1:23:9} {DIALOGUE}: Yes, Papa, name it.
{1:23:6 - 1:23:9} {DIALOGUE}: Name it.

{1:23:9 - 1:23:19} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{1:23:15 - 1:23:19} {DIALOGUE}: I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
{1:23:15 - 1:23:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SCHIKANEDER
{1:23:15 - 1:23:23} {DIALOGUE}: What did he say?
{1:23:15 - 1:23:23} {DIALOGUE}: What did he say?
{1:23:15 - 1:23:23} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{1:23:19 - 1:23:23} {DIALOGUE}: Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
{1:23:19 - 1:23:25} {CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{1:23:23 - 1:23:25} {DIALOGUE}: I'm tired of this game.
{1:23:23 - 1:23:30} {DIALOGUE}: Please play without me.
{1:23:23 - 1:23:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{1:23:25 - 1:23:30} {DIALOGUE}: But my penalty.
{1:23:25 - 1:23:30} {DIALOGUE}: I've got to have a penalty.
{1:23:25 - 1:23:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All the bystanders are watching.
{1:23:25 - 1:23:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SCHIKANEDER
{1:23:25 - 1:23:43} {DIALOGUE}: I've got a good one.
{1:23:25 - 1:23:43} {DIALOGUE}: I've got the perfect one for you.
{1:23:25 - 1:23:43} {DIALOGUE}: Come over here.
{1:23:25 - 1:23:43} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart runs over to the forte-piano, and Schikaneder surrenders his place at it.
{1:23:25 - 1:23:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SCHIKANEDER
{1:23:41 - 1:23:43} {DIALOGUE}: Now, I want you to play our tune - sitting backwards.
{1:23:41 - 1:23:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Applause.
{1:23:41 - 1:23:48} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{1:23:41 - 1:23:48} {DIALOGUE}: Oh, that's really too easy.
{1:23:41 - 1:23:48} {DIALOGUE}: Any child can do that.
{1:23:41 - 1:23:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Amused sounds of disbelief.
{1:23:41 - 1:23:48} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SCHIKANEDER
{1:23:44 - 1:23:48} {DIALOGUE}: And a fugue in the manner of Sebastian Bach.
{1:23:44 - 1:24:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Renewed applause at this wicked extra penalty.
{1:23:44 - 1:24:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart smiles at Schikaneder - it is the sort of challenge he loves.
{1:23:44 - 1:24:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He defiantly puts on Constanze's wig and seats himself with his back to the keyboard.
{1:23:44 - 1:24:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Before the astonished eyes of the company he proceeds to execute this absurdly difficult task.
{1:23:44 - 1:24:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His right hand plays the bass part, his left hand the treble, and with this added difficulty he improvises a brilliant fugue on the subject of the tune to which they have been dancing.
{1:23:44 - 1:24:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Attracted by this astonishing feat, the players draw nearer to the instrument.
{1:23:44 - 1:24:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: So does Salieri, cautiously, with some of the bystanders.
{1:23:44 - 1:24:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Constanze watches him approach.
{1:23:44 - 1:24:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Only Leopold sits by himself, sulking.
{1:23:44 - 1:24:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The fugue ends amidst terrific clapping.
{1:23:44 - 1:24:58} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The guests call out to Mozart.
{1:23:44 - 1:24:58} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GUESTS
{1:24:55 - 1:24:58} {DIALOGUE}: Another!

{1:25:1 - 1:25:48} {DIALOGUE}: Do Salieri!
{1:25:1 - 1:25:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SMASH CUT: Salieri's masked face whips around and looks at her.
{1:25:1 - 1:25:48} {CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{1:25:1 - 1:25:48} {DIALOGUE}: Now that's hard.
{1:25:1 - 1:25:48} {DIALOGUE}: That's very hard.
{1:25:1 - 1:25:48} {DIALOGUE}: For Salieri one has to face the right way around.
{1:25:1 - 1:25:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Giggling, he turns around and sits at the keyboard.
{1:25:1 - 1:25:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, watched by a highly amused group, he begins a wicked parody.
{1:25:1 - 1:25:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He furrows his brow in mock concentration and closes his eyes.
{1:25:1 - 1:25:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he begins to play the tune to which they danced, in the most obvious way imaginable, relying heavily on a totally and offensively unimaginative bass of tonic and dominant, endlessly repeated.
{1:25:1 - 1:25:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The music is the very essence of banality.
{1:25:1 - 1:25:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The bystanders rock with laughter.
{1:25:1 - 1:25:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart starts to giggle wildly.
{1:25:1 - 1:25:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Through this excruciating scene, Salieri stares at Constanze, who suddenly turns her head and looks challengingly back at him.
{1:25:1 - 1:25:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart's parody reaches its coarse climax with him adding a fart noise instead of notes to end cadences.
{1:25:1 - 1:25:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He builds this up, urged on in his clowning by everyone else, until suddenly he stops and cries out.
{1:25:1 - 1:25:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The laughter cuts off.
{1:25:1 - 1:25:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart stands up, clutching his behind as if he has made a mess in his breeches.
{1:25:1 - 1:25:48} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The momentary hush of alarm is followed by a howl of laughter.

{1:37:47 - 1:38:7} {DIALOGUE}: No one can understand a word.
{1:37:47 - 1:38:7} {DIALOGUE}: But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony.
{1:37:47 - 1:38:7} {DIALOGUE}: Isn't that marvelous?
{1:37:47 - 1:38:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: VON SWIETEN
{1:38:4 - 1:38:7} {DIALOGUE}: Mozart, music is not the issue here.
{1:38:7 - 1:38:12} {DIALOGUE}: No one doubts your talent.
{1:38:7 - 1:38:12} {DIALOGUE}: It is your judgment of literature that's in question.
{1:38:13 - 1:38:19} {DIALOGUE}: Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce.
{1:38:19 - 1:38:22} {DIALOGUE}: Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?

{1:38:26 - 1:38:29} {DIALOGUE}: What does that mean?
{1:38:33 - 1:38:37} {DIALOGUE}: Elevated!
{1:38:33 - 1:38:37} {DIALOGUE}: The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me.
{1:38:33 - 1:38:37} {DIALOGUE}: I'm sorry.
{1:38:33 - 1:38:37} {DIALOGUE}: I'm stupid.
{1:38:33 - 1:38:37} {DIALOGUE}: But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things!

{1:39:34 - 1:39:45} {CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPH
{1:39:41 - 1:39:45} {DIALOGUE}: You are passionate, Mozart!
