{0:28:0 - 0:28:4} {DIALOGUE}: No... but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you.
{0:28:0 - 0:28:20} {DIALOGUE}: I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
{0:28:0 - 0:28:20} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:28:0 - 0:28:20} {DIALOGUE}: I was attempting to... get in the spirit of things.
{0:28:0 - 0:28:20} {DIALOGUE}: I thought it would be humorous.
{0:28:0 - 0:28:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data frowns.
{0:28:0 - 0:28:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: troubled by this recent experience.

{0:28:16 - 0:28:20} {DIALOGUE}: Data... you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
{0:28:16 - 0:28:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:28:16 - 0:28:29} {DIALOGUE}: It has occurred to me on several occasions.
{0:28:27 - 0:28:29} {DIALOGUE}: But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
{0:28:27 - 0:28:32} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{0:28:27 - 0:28:32} {DIALOGUE}: Wait a minute.
{0:28:29 - 0:28:32} {DIALOGUE}: I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
{0:28:29 - 0:28:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:28:33 - 0:28:35} {DIALOGUE}: That is true.
{0:28:35 - 0:28:40} {DIALOGUE}: However, I believe my growth as an artificial life form has reached an impasse.
{0:28:47 - 0:28:50} {DIALOGUE}: For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human" - to grow beyond my original programming.
{0:28:51 - 0:28:56} {DIALOGUE}: And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor.
{0:28:51 - 0:29:1} {META_DATA}: (re: chip)

{0:29:20 - 0:29:41} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data sits down and La Forge moves to stand behind him.
{0:29:20 - 0:29:41} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI

{0:29:36 - 0:29:44} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:29:42 - 0:29:44} {DIALOGUE}: Agreed.

{0:29:42 - 0:29:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER

{0:30:22 - 0:30:28} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER

{0:30:28 - 0:30:32} {DIALOGUE}: One of the scientists.
{0:30:28 - 0:30:38} {DIALOGUE}: a Doctor Soran... has insisted on speaking with you.
{0:30:28 - 0:30:38} {META_DATA}: (beat)
{0:30:34 - 0:30:38} {DIALOGUE}: I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.

{0:30:48 - 0:30:52} {DIALOGUE}: Thank you.
{0:30:48 - 0:31:26} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat, then Riker turns and EXITS.

{0:30:48 - 0:31:26} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They move to the bar.

{0:30:48 - 0:31:26} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She sets down an exotic-looking container full of dark liquid.
{0:30:48 - 0:31:26} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN

{0:31:39 - 0:31:43} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{0:31:39 - 0:31:43} {DIALOGUE}: I'll explain later...
{0:31:39 - 0:31:51} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data finishes the drink... concentrates, tries to make sense of the rush of feelings.
{0:31:39 - 0:31:51} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His expression is one of disgust.
{0:31:39 - 0:31:51} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN

{0:32:5 - 0:32:29} {DIALOGUE}: Yes, yes, Captain -- thank you for coming.
{0:32:5 - 0:32:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The men shake hands and Picard sits down.
{0:32:5 - 0:32:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Soran is an imposing physical presence, but at the moment he seems very much the eccentric scientists consumed with his work.
{0:32:5 - 0:32:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard waves away a waiter.
{0:32:5 - 0:32:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD

{0:32:35 - 0:32:38} {DIALOGUE}: I need to return to the observatory immediately.
{0:32:38 - 0:32:42} {DIALOGUE}: I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.
{0:32:38 - 0:32:45} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard's reaction is a little impatient -- this doesn't sound that imperative to him.
{0:32:38 - 0:32:45} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:32:42 - 0:32:45} {DIALOGUE}: Doctor... we're still conducting an investigation into the attack.
{0:32:42 - 0:32:50} {DIALOGUE}: Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory.
{0:32:48 - 0:32:50} {DIALOGUE}: Until then --
{0:32:48 - 0:33:0} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{0:32:55 - 0:33:0} {DIALOGUE}: The timing is very important on my experiment -- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
{0:32:55 - 0:33:3} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:33:0 - 0:33:3} {DIALOGUE}: We're doing the best we can.

{0:33:0 - 0:33:17} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard moves to stand, but Soran reaches out and gently but firmly grabs him by the arm.
{0:33:0 - 0:33:17} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The unexpected physical contact and the change of intensity in Soran's face stops Picard in his tracks.

{0:33:19 - 0:33:23} {DIALOGUE}: We leave so many things unfinished in our lives -- I'm sure you can understand.
{0:33:19 - 0:33:32} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For some reason, Soran's words have struck a deep chord within Picard.
{0:33:19 - 0:33:32} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks away from Soran's compelling gaze and thinks for a long moment.
{0:33:19 - 0:33:32} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When he finally speaks, his voice is barely above a whisper.
{0:33:19 - 0:33:32} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:33:30 - 0:33:32} {DIALOGUE}: I'll see what I can do...
{0:33:30 - 0:34:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard walks away without a word before Soran can thank him.
{0:33:30 - 0:34:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Soran looks after him with relief, then pulls out an ANTIQUE POCKET WATCH and opens it.
{0:33:30 - 0:34:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks at the watch for a long moment.
{0:33:30 - 0:34:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: then snaps it closed and head for the opposite exit from the one Picard took.
{0:33:30 - 0:34:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: FOLLOW Soran across Ten Forward...until he suddenly stops in shock at something he sees...
{0:33:30 - 0:34:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 58 SORAN'S POV

{0:33:30 - 0:34:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A dark look crosses his face -- he is disturbed by the sight of Guinan.
{0:33:30 - 0:34:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He quickly turns and EXITS.
{0:33:30 - 0:34:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 60 ON GUINAN
{0:33:30 - 0:34:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: she begins to sense something, as though someone is watching her.
{0:33:30 - 0:34:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She turns, looks in the direction where Soran was just standing, but there's no one there now.
{0:33:30 - 0:34:20} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She shakes off the feeling and goes back to work.

{0:34:23 - 0:34:35} {DIALOGUE}: In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon.
{0:34:32 - 0:34:35} {DIALOGUE}: But they never found a way to stabilize it.
{0:34:32 - 0:34:37} {CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{0:34:35 - 0:34:37} {DIALOGUE}: Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory?

{0:48:4 - 0:48:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MOVE TO REVEAL Guinan's Quarters, which are unlike any of the others on the Enterprise.
{0:48:4 - 0:48:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: None of the standard furniture, consoles or decoration are present.
{0:48:4 - 0:48:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The floor is made of tile, not carpet... the walls are draped in exotic fabric.
{0:48:4 - 0:48:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The lighting is moody and subdued.
{0:48:4 - 0:48:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard is standing before Guinan, who is sitting cross- legged on the floor.
{0:48:4 - 0:48:9} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They talk to each other with an easy familiarity... two old friends who know each other well.

{0:48:7 - 0:48:9} {DIALOGUE}: Do you remember him?
{0:48:7 - 0:48:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{0:48:7 - 0:48:16} {DIALOGUE}: Oh yes.
{0:48:7 - 0:48:16} {DIALOGUE}: I remember everyone who was on the Lakul... every face.
{0:48:7 - 0:48:16} {DIALOGUE}: even the ones who didn't make it...
{0:48:7 - 0:48:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Guinan stands and begins to move about the room... she's clearly troubled by the memories.
{0:48:7 - 0:48:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She hesitates, looks off into the middle-distance for a few moments.
{0:48:7 - 0:48:16} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard moves to her.
{0:48:7 - 0:48:16} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:48:7 - 0:48:16} {DIALOGUE}: Guinan.
{0:48:11 - 0:48:16} {DIALOGUE}: It's important that you tell me what you know.
{0:48:16 - 0:48:22} {DIALOGUE}: We think Soran's developed a weapon... a terrible weapon.
{0:48:23 - 0:48:25} {DIALOGUE}: It might give him enough power to --
{0:48:23 - 0:48:28} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{0:48:25 - 0:48:28} {DIALOGUE}: Soran doesn't care about power or weapons.
{0:48:29 - 0:48:32} {DIALOGUE}: All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
{0:48:29 - 0:48:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:48:32 - 0:48:34} {DIALOGUE}: What's the "Nexus"?
{0:48:32 - 0:48:51} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Guinan moves to a table and begins to shift around some exotic-looking alien artifacts... distracting herself... this is difficult for her to discuss.
{0:48:32 - 0:48:51} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{0:48:47 - 0:48:51} {DIALOGUE}: It's a place I've tried very hard to forget...
{0:48:47 - 0:49:0} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She makes the decision to plunge ahead.
{0:48:47 - 0:49:0} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{0:48:47 - 0:49:0} {DIALOGUE}: That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon traveling through space... it's a doorway.
{0:48:47 - 0:49:0} {DIALOGUE}: It leads to another place... the Nexus.
{0:48:47 - 0:49:0} {DIALOGUE}: It doesn't exist in our Universe... and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
{0:48:47 - 0:49:0} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:48:58 - 0:49:0} {DIALOGUE}: What happened to you?
{0:48:58 - 0:49:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{0:48:58 - 0:49:8} {DIALOGUE}: I can't remember very much... what it looked like or how long I was there... but I do remember how it felt...
{0:48:58 - 0:49:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She turns to him and her face is filled with some kind of awe at the memory.
{0:48:58 - 0:49:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{0:49:5 - 0:49:8} {DIALOGUE}: It was like being inside... joy.
{0:49:5 - 0:49:24} {DIALOGUE}: As if joy was a real thing that I could wrap around myself.
{0:49:5 - 0:49:24} {DIALOGUE}: I've never been so content...
{0:49:5 - 0:49:24} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A long beat as Picard absorbs her words.
{0:49:5 - 0:49:24} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:49:22 - 0:49:24} {DIALOGUE}: But then you were beamed away...
{0:49:22 - 0:49:27} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Guinan shows a rare burst of anger.
{0:49:22 - 0:49:27} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{0:49:24 - 0:49:27} {DIALOGUE}: I was pulled away.
{0:49:28 - 0:49:30} {DIALOGUE}: I didn't want to leave; none of us did.
{0:49:28 - 0:49:44} {DIALOGUE}: I felt like I'd left a part of myself behind.
{0:49:28 - 0:49:44} {DIALOGUE}: All I could think about was getting back... I didn't care what I had to do.
{0:49:28 - 0:49:44} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Guinan moves to a window and looks out at the stars.
{0:49:28 - 0:49:44} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{0:49:28 - 0:49:44} {DIALOGUE}: It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it.
{0:49:28 - 0:49:44} {DIALOGUE}: And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me...
{0:49:28 - 0:49:44} {META_DATA}: (beat)
{0:49:28 - 0:49:44} {DIALOGUE}: I knew things about people... about events...about time...
{0:49:28 - 0:49:44} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:49:28 - 0:49:44} {DIALOGUE}: Your "sixth sense"... I've always wondered where it came from...
{0:49:28 - 0:49:44} {META_DATA}: (beat)
{0:49:43 - 0:49:44} {DIALOGUE}: And what about Soran?
{0:49:43 - 0:49:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{0:49:43 - 0:49:52} {DIALOGUE}: Soran may still be obsessed with getting back.
{0:49:43 - 0:49:52} {DIALOGUE}: And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
{0:49:43 - 0:49:52} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:49:50 - 0:49:52} {DIALOGUE}: But why destroy a star...?
{0:49:50 - 0:50:0} {META_DATA}: (beat)
{0:49:58 - 0:50:0} {DIALOGUE}: Thank you, Guinan.

{0:49:58 - 0:50:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{0:49:58 - 0:50:46} {DIALOGUE}: Let someone else do it, Jean-Luc.
{0:49:58 - 0:50:46} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard stops, looks at her.
{0:49:58 - 0:50:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{0:49:58 - 0:50:46} {DIALOGUE}: Let them send another starship.
{0:49:58 - 0:50:46} {DIALOGUE}: Don't get near the ribbon.
{0:49:58 - 0:50:46} {DIALOGUE}: If you go into that Nexus, you're not going to care about Soran or the Enterprise or me.
{0:49:58 - 0:50:46} {DIALOGUE}: All you're going to care about is how it feels to be there.
{0:49:58 - 0:50:46} {META_DATA}: (beat)
{0:49:58 - 0:50:46} {DIALOGUE}: And you're never going to come back.
{0:49:58 - 0:50:46} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard weighs her words... sees the warning in her eyes... and carefully backs away and EXITS.

{0:49:58 - 0:50:46} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A dimly-lit room somewhere in the bowels of the Klingon ship.
{0:49:58 - 0:50:46} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Like every other room on this decrepit ship, the room looks well-worn and ill-maintained.

{0:49:58 - 0:50:46} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A PADD and Soran's pocket watch sit on the table.
{0:49:58 - 0:50:46} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi is sitting in a chair across from him -- his shirt has been removed.

{0:49:58 - 0:50:46} {META_DATA}: (re: VISOR)
{0:50:42 - 0:50:46} {DIALOGUE}: A remarkable piece of equipment... but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?

{0:51:4 - 0:51:7} {DIALOGUE}: What's normal?
{0:51:4 - 0:51:14} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN

{0:51:27 - 0:51:31} {DIALOGUE}: Some people call us a race of "listeners".

{0:51:38 - 0:52:18} {DIALOGUE}: and me.
{0:51:38 - 0:52:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi thinks.
{0:51:38 - 0:52:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{0:51:38 - 0:52:18} {DIALOGUE}: Trilithium is an experimental compound developed by the Romulans.

{0:51:38 - 0:52:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Soran picks up the PADD from the desk and activates it.
{0:51:38 - 0:52:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly something small, with sharp edges, can be seen MOVING just underneath Geordi's skin near his chest.
{0:51:38 - 0:52:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi moves his hand to the spot, but then the protrusion is suddenly gone.
{0:51:38 - 0:52:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{0:51:38 - 0:52:18} {DIALOGUE}: I don't want a science lecture.
{0:51:38 - 0:52:18} {DIALOGUE}: You were on that observatory looking for trilithium... why?
{0:51:38 - 0:52:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{0:51:38 - 0:52:18} {DIALOGUE}: I was ordered to by the Captain.
{0:51:38 - 0:52:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On the PADD in Soran's hand, we can now see an interior graphic of Geordi's body sitting in the chair.
{0:51:38 - 0:52:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The graphic is interactive, moving as Geordi moves.
{0:51:38 - 0:52:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A BLINKING DOT represents the movement of the probe inside his body.
{0:51:38 - 0:52:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Right now, the dot is in the middle of his chest.
{0:51:38 - 0:52:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{0:51:38 - 0:52:18} {DIALOGUE}: Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we?

{0:51:38 - 0:52:18} {META_DATA}: (beat)

{0:51:38 - 0:52:18} {DIALOGUE}: What about... Guinan?

{0:51:38 - 0:52:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{0:52:16 - 0:52:18} {DIALOGUE}: Guinan?

{0:52:16 - 0:52:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Soran looks up at Geordi.
{0:52:16 - 0:52:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{0:52:16 - 0:52:22} {DIALOGUE}: My instincts tell me you're lying.

{0:52:16 - 0:52:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi gasps and starts to breathe.
{0:52:16 - 0:52:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{0:52:16 - 0:52:22} {DIALOGUE}: Oh... I forgot to tell you.
{0:52:16 - 0:52:22} {DIALOGUE}: While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream.
{0:52:16 - 0:52:22} {DIALOGUE}: It's been navigating your cardiovascular system... and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.
{0:52:16 - 0:52:22} {META_DATA}: (smiles)
{0:52:16 - 0:52:22} {DIALOGUE}: A little trick I picked up from the Borg.

{0:52:16 - 0:52:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{0:52:16 - 0:52:22} {DIALOGUE}: I just stopped your heart for five seconds.
{0:52:16 - 0:52:22} {DIALOGUE}: It felt like an eternity, didn't it?
{0:52:16 - 0:52:22} {DIALOGUE}: Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
{0:52:16 - 0:52:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{0:52:16 - 0:52:22} {DIALOGUE}: No... I didn't know that...
{0:52:16 - 0:52:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN

{0:52:20 - 0:52:22} {DIALOGUE}: Now.
{0:52:20 - 0:52:35} {DIALOGUE}: Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

{0:52:20 - 0:52:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{0:52:20 - 0:52:35} {DIALOGUE}: I told you everything... you might as well just kill me right now...
{0:52:20 - 0:52:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Soran's features soften as he smiles slightly.
{0:52:20 - 0:52:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For a moment, he looks genuinely compassionate -- and it's a disturbing contrast to his usual dark intensity.
{0:52:20 - 0:52:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{0:52:20 - 0:52:35} {DIALOGUE}: I'm not a killer, Mr. La Forge.

{0:52:20 - 0:52:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The monitors around the room display various diagrams of the ENERGY RIBBON (as seen in the beginning of the film).
{0:52:20 - 0:52:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data is sitting at a computer console which has a great deal of complex information on the screen.
{0:52:20 - 0:52:35} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard is standing next to him.

{0:52:32 - 0:52:42} {DIALOGUE}: Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon... if that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
{0:52:32 - 0:52:42} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:52:32 - 0:52:42} {DIALOGUE}: The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector.

{0:53:20 - 0:53:49} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{0:53:20 - 0:53:49} {DIALOGUE}: Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome.
{0:53:20 - 0:53:49} {DIALOGUE}: It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
{0:53:20 - 0:53:49} {CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{0:53:20 - 0:53:49} {DIALOGUE}: But I did not deal with it, sir.

{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard nods as the woman EXITS the room.
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks around the scene, utterly happy, utterly content.
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The children continue to chatter and laugh among themselves as Picard's eye falls on the glorious Christmas tree.
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He can't help but smile as he looks over the ornaments and decorations...
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 156 PICARD'S POV
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: of the sparkling lights and ornaments -- a swirl of color and light.
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 157 PICARD
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His eye is caught by something in particular on the tree.
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He leans forward slightly and stares at it.
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 158 PICARD'S POV (VFX-P)
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His eye has been caught by an ORNAMENT near the top of the tree.
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is a large and beautiful glass ball with a tiny LIGHT at the center in the shape of a star.
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Picard watches, the star suddenly GOES OUT... and it radiates a SHIMMERING LIGHT EFFECT that expands outward into the glass sphere.
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's a startling and beautiful ornament whose effect is reminiscent of the star going out, as seen earlier in the movie.
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But this is just coincidence.
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: this is the way the ornament was designed and it's simply one of many ornaments on the tree.
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 159 PICARD
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: reacts.
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The image of the ornament has touched a nerve within him somewhere.
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It has reminded him of something he'd nearly forgotten - a discordant note in an otherwise wondrous and magical scene.
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He frowns, the reverie momentarily disrupted.
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But he tries to push it aside, not wanting the spell to be broken.
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stands and turns away from the tree and looks out a nearby window -- it's snowing and the beautiful image of snow soothes him for a moment.
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he reacts to something.
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 160 PICARD'S POV (VFX-P)
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: reflected on the pane of glass is the image of the ornament -- it's still blinking.
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard now realizes that this image is not going to go away... he can't hide from it.
{1:23:38 - 1:25:57} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:25:53 - 1:25:57} {DIALOGUE}: No... this isn't right... this can't be real...

{1:25:53 - 1:26:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 161 GUINAN (VFX-P)
{1:25:53 - 1:26:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: standing before him.
{1:25:53 - 1:26:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She is wearing the same outfit seen in the beginning of the movie on the Enterprise-B.
{1:25:53 - 1:26:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As they talk, the children and the woman continue to move about their business as if Picard and Guinan aren't there.
{1:25:53 - 1:26:2} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard is stunned.
{1:25:53 - 1:26:2} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:25:58 - 1:26:2} {DIALOGUE}: Guinan... what's going on?
{1:25:58 - 1:26:7} {DIALOGUE}: Where am I?
{1:25:58 - 1:26:7} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{1:26:4 - 1:26:7} {DIALOGUE}: You're in the Nexus.

{1:26:15 - 1:26:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{1:26:15 - 1:26:34} {DIALOGUE}: Enjoy them, Jean-Luc...
{1:26:15 - 1:26:34} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard tries to make sense of it- he focuses on Guinan.
{1:26:15 - 1:26:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:26:31 - 1:26:34} {DIALOGUE}: Guinan, what are you doing here?
{1:26:35 - 1:26:37} {DIALOGUE}: I thought you were on the Enterprise.
{1:26:35 - 1:26:45} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{1:26:35 - 1:26:45} {DIALOGUE}: I am on the Enterprise...I am also here.
{1:26:35 - 1:26:45} {META_DATA}: (off his puzzled look)
{1:26:41 - 1:26:45} {DIALOGUE}: Think of me as... an "echo" of the person you know... a part of her she left behind...

{1:26:46 - 1:26:57} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN

{1:26:46 - 1:26:57} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:26:46 - 1:26:57} {DIALOGUE}: Soran...?
{1:26:46 - 1:26:57} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN

{1:26:46 - 1:26:57} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:26:46 - 1:26:57} {DIALOGUE}: Where is he now?
{1:26:46 - 1:26:57} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{1:26:46 - 1:26:57} {DIALOGUE}: Wherever he wanted to be...
{1:26:46 - 1:26:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Guinan smiles at him.
{1:26:46 - 1:26:57} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BOY'S VOICE
{1:26:51 - 1:26:57} {DIALOGUE}: Papa, help me build my castle!
{1:26:51 - 1:26:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard glances over at the boy, who is building a play castle out of the 24th-century equivalent of "Lego".
{1:26:51 - 1:26:57} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For a moment, Picard is tempted to drift back to the warm embrace of the fantasy...
{1:26:51 - 1:26:57} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:26:51 - 1:26:57} {META_DATA}: (to boy)

{1:27:8 - 1:27:23} {META_DATA}: (smiles)
{1:27:8 - 1:27:23} {DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{1:27:8 - 1:27:23} {DIALOGUE}: They're great, aren't they?
{1:27:20 - 1:27:23} {DIALOGUE}: You can go back and see them born... go forward and see your grandchildren... time has no meaning here.
{1:27:20 - 1:27:35} {CHARACTER_NAME}: WOMAN'S VOICE
{1:27:32 - 1:27:35} {DIALOGUE}: Dinner's ready!

{1:27:32 - 1:28:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The youngest boy looks at Picard, goes over to him and takes his hand.
{1:27:32 - 1:28:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: BOY
{1:27:32 - 1:28:8} {DIALOGUE}: Papa... are you coming?
{1:27:32 - 1:28:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard looks down into the face of his child.
{1:27:32 - 1:28:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His heart swells, the temptation to stay here and live this out is profound.
{1:27:32 - 1:28:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Almost in a trance, he takes a few steps with the child toward the dining room... His eye is caught again by the unusual ornament on the tree for a moment... torn between the two images.
{1:27:32 - 1:28:8} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: and then, in one of the most difficult moments of his life, he bends down to the child...
{1:27:32 - 1:28:8} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:28:4 - 1:28:8} {DIALOGUE}: Go on... go on without me...
{1:28:4 - 1:28:33} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The boy looks at him quizzically for a moment, then obeys his father and dashes off toward the dining room to join the others.
{1:28:4 - 1:28:33} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard straightens up and tries to steel his voice.
{1:28:4 - 1:28:33} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:28:29 - 1:28:33} {DIALOGUE}: Guinan... can I leave the Nexus?
{1:28:29 - 1:28:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{1:28:29 - 1:28:36} {DIALOGUE}: Why would you want to leave?
{1:28:29 - 1:28:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:28:29 - 1:28:36} {META_DATA}: (insistent)

{1:28:33 - 1:28:36} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD

{1:28:39 - 1:28:46} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard realizes the opportunity before him.
{1:28:39 - 1:28:46} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:28:44 - 1:28:46} {DIALOGUE}: I know exactly where I want to go... and when.
{1:28:44 - 1:28:53} {DIALOGUE}: Back to that mountaintop on Veridian Three... before Soran put out the star.
{1:28:50 - 1:28:53} {DIALOGUE}: I have to stop him.
{1:28:50 - 1:28:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{1:28:50 - 1:28:55} {DIALOGUE}: What makes you think things will be any different this time?
{1:28:50 - 1:28:55} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:28:50 - 1:28:55} {DIALOGUE}: You're right.

{1:28:54 - 1:28:55} {DIALOGUE}: Guinan, will you come back with me?

{1:28:54 - 1:28:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{1:28:56 - 1:28:59} {DIALOGUE}: I can't leave.

{1:28:56 - 1:29:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{1:28:56 - 1:29:22} {DIALOGUE}: I know just the guy.
{1:28:56 - 1:29:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly there's the cry of a HAWK from offscreen.
{1:28:56 - 1:29:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard turns at the sound --
{1:28:56 - 1:29:22} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 162 EXT. KIRK'S HOME - DAY
{1:28:56 - 1:29:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard finds himself standing outside a rustic, but Architecturally striking house with spectacular views in the Canadian Rockies.
{1:28:56 - 1:29:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A hawk is circling overhead, making the crying sound that Picard heard.
{1:28:56 - 1:29:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The air is cold, frigid -- Picard can see his breath.
{1:28:56 - 1:29:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard is just starting to adjust to this sudden change in location when he hears the sound of wood being CHOPPED from around the corner of the house.
{1:28:56 - 1:29:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard moves to look around the corner and sees -
{1:28:56 - 1:29:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: James T. Kirk.
{1:28:56 - 1:29:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's still in his uniform and looks exactly as he did the last time we saw him aboard the Enterprise-B at the beginning of the film.
{1:28:56 - 1:29:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is vigorously chopping wood with an axe.
{1:28:56 - 1:29:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's enjoying himself, lost in the sheer pleasure of the manual labor.
{1:28:56 - 1:29:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's never felt this good in his life.
{1:28:56 - 1:29:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There's no trace of back pain or any other ailment.
{1:28:56 - 1:29:22} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard recognizes the famous Captain - as would any 24 Century Starfleet officer.
{1:28:56 - 1:29:22} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:29:20 - 1:29:22} {DIALOGUE}: James Kirk.
{1:29:20 - 1:29:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk pauses, looks up at the strange man before him.
{1:29:20 - 1:29:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His expression is wondrous, almost child-like.
{1:29:20 - 1:29:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Like in Picard's Christmas sequence, Kirk is immersed in the sensual feeling of the Nexus.
{1:29:20 - 1:29:29} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's like a dream that's over-powered him.
{1:29:20 - 1:29:29} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:29:27 - 1:29:29} {DIALOGUE}: Beautiful day, isn't it?
{1:29:27 - 1:29:34} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD

{1:29:32 - 1:29:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:29:32 - 1:29:59} {DIALOGUE}: Do you mind?
{1:29:32 - 1:29:59} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It takes Picard a beat before he realizes that Kirk wants him to put the log on the chopping block for him.
{1:29:32 - 1:29:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:29:32 - 1:29:59} {DIALOGUE}: Oh.
{1:29:32 - 1:29:59} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard places the log on the block and Kirk gives it a vigorous chop with the axe.
{1:29:32 - 1:29:59} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:29:54 - 1:29:59} {DIALOGUE}: Captain, do you realize what --
{1:29:54 - 1:30:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But Kirk interrupts as he sees something o.c.
{1:29:54 - 1:30:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:29:54 - 1:30:18} {DIALOGUE}: Wait a second.
{1:29:54 - 1:30:18} {DIALOGUE}: I think something's burning.
{1:29:54 - 1:30:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard follows his look to see SMOKE billowing out of one of the windows of the house.
{1:29:54 - 1:30:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk rushes into the house, and Picard follows...
{1:29:54 - 1:30:18} {SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 163 INT. KIRK'S HOME- KITCHEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS
{1:29:54 - 1:30:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk rushes in.
{1:29:54 - 1:30:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The kitchen's decor is 19th century with a few 23rd Century touches -- copper pans and an antique stove mixed comfortably with computer consoles and Starfleet paraphernalia.
{1:29:54 - 1:30:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard hesitates in the doorway -- a little unsure about rushing into some stranger's house.
{1:29:54 - 1:30:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk yanks a burning frying pan of food off the stove.
{1:29:54 - 1:30:18} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's very hot -- he quickly sets it down near the sink, waves the smoke away with his hand.
{1:29:54 - 1:30:18} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:30:13 - 1:30:18} {DIALOGUE}: Looks like someone was cooking eggs...
{1:30:13 - 1:30:31} {META_DATA}: (to Picard)
{1:30:13 - 1:30:31} {DIALOGUE}: Come on in, it's all right.
{1:30:30 - 1:30:31} {DIALOGUE}: This is my house -- or at least it used to be, I sold it years ago.
{1:30:30 - 1:30:39} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard comes in and tries to orient Kirk to what's going on.
{1:30:30 - 1:30:39} {CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{1:30:33 - 1:30:39} {DIALOGUE}: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the starship Enterprise.
{1:30:33 - 1:30:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Before Kirk can react to this remark, an antique CLOCK on a shelf CHIMES as it strikes the hour.
{1:30:33 - 1:30:50} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk moves to the shelf and looks at the clock in surprise and wonder -- he is entranced by this experience, beginning to connect with things and memories from his past.
{1:30:33 - 1:30:50} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:30:48 - 1:30:50} {DIALOGUE}: This clock... I gave this clock to Bones...

{1:30:48 - 1:30:56} {META_DATA}: (pressing on)
{1:30:50 - 1:30:56} {DIALOGUE}: I'm from what you would consider the future... the twenty-fourth century.
{1:30:50 - 1:31:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk hears what Picard is saying, but like Picard in his fantasy, he is more interested in the sights and sounds around him.
{1:30:50 - 1:31:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A dog barks from o.c.
{1:30:50 - 1:31:15} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They both look as a large black dog bounds into the room and greets Kirk with enthusiasm.

{1:31:13 - 1:31:17} {CHARACTER_NAME}: ANTONIA'S VOICE
{1:31:16 - 1:31:17} {DIALOGUE}: Come on, Jim, I'm starving.
{1:31:17 - 1:31:21} {DIALOGUE}: How long are you going to be rattling around that kitchen?
{1:31:17 - 1:31:23} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.

{1:31:21 - 1:31:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:31:21 - 1:31:30} {DIALOGUE}: Wait a minute...
{1:31:21 - 1:31:30} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk glances at Picard.
{1:31:21 - 1:31:30} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:31:26 - 1:31:30} {DIALOGUE}: The future... what are you talking about?

{1:31:32 - 1:31:58} {CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{1:31:54 - 1:31:58} {DIALOGUE}: This is nine years ago... the day I told her I was going back to Starfleet...
{1:31:54 - 1:32:12} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk is swept up in the moment, overwhelmed by memories, sensations, feelings.
{1:31:54 - 1:32:12} {SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He goes back to the frying pan and looks at the contents with a sudden burst of recognition.
