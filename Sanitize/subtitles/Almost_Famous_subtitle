1
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:30,002
You want to be Atticus Finch. Good!

2
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,422
- I like him.
- Why?

3
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,299
- He's honest.
- Yes.

4
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,260
- He stands up for the right thing.
- Yes.

5
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,304
- And he's a good father.
- He is.

6
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,806
- Did it all by himself.
- Did what all by himself?

7
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:45,267
- Raised his kids.
- He didn't!

8
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:48,437
Who was the woman
that came every day?

9
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,148
- Calpurnia.
- Calpurnia. He remembered.

10
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,192
- What about Boo?
- What?

11
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,987
Boo's the most interesting character
in To Kill a Mockingbird.

12
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,114
Excuse me.

13
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:03,368
I'm a teacher. "Xmas" isn't
in the English language.

14
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:07,039
It's either "Merry Christmas"...

15
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,875
...or "Happy Holidays."

16
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:12,127
Thank you.

17
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:13,795
Sure.

18
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,761
Tell me about Livia.

19
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:25,057
She killed everyone so her son
could be king. Like Nixon.

20
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,021
Please, please, please.

21
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,650
- Anita?
- Hey, Mom.

22
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:39,196
- Want something to eat?
- No, thanks. I already ate.

23
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,783
- Are you sure? I made soy cutlets.
- I'm fine.

24
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,285
Wait. You've been kissing.

25
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:48,038
- No, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

26
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,958
- I can tell.
- You can't tell.

27
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,962
Not only can I tell,
I know who it is. It's Darryl.

28
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:01,051
What you got under your coat?

29
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,560
- Why can't we listen to our music?
- It's about drugs and promiscuous sex.

30
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,603
Simon and Garfunkel is poetry.

31
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,398
The poetry of drugs
and promiscuous sex.

32
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:18,026
Honey, they're on pot.

33
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:24,116
First, it was butter.
Then sugar and white flour.

34
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:28,412
Bacon, eggs, bologna,
rock'n'roll, motorcycles.

35
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,207
Then, it was celebrating
Christmas in September...

36
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,085
...when it wouldn't
be commercialized.

37
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:39,256
- What else will you ban?
- You wanna rebel against knowledge.

38
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:44,511
- I give you the Cliffs Notes on life.
- We're like nobody else I know!

39
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:49,266
I'm a college professor. Why can't
I teach my own kids? Use me.

40
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,769
Darryl says you use knowledge
to keep me down.

41
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:58,150
He says I'm a "yes" person and you
are raising us in a "no" environment.

42
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,111
Clearly, Darryl
doesn't hear "no" much.

43
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,614
I can't live here! I hate you!

44
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,824
- William hates you.
- I don't.

45
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,243
You don't even know the truth.

46
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:11,747
- Don't be a drama queen.
- Feck you!

47
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,750
This is a house of lies!

48
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,336
There it is.

49
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:21,673
- Your sister used the "F" word.
- I think she said "feck."

50
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:25,302
- What's the difference?
- The letter "U."

51
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:03,257
Are you really in our grade?

52
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:09,346
Hey, guys! Check it out.
William doesn't have any pubes.

53
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:12,724
- How old are you, man?
- He's not a man.

54
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,602
- He's a baby.
- Bet he doesn't get zits.

55
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:18,272
Everyone has hair.
What's wrong?

56
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,942
- How old are you, like 2?
- How pathetic!

57
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,736
Where are your pubes?

58
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,447
I had them.

59
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,867
I shaved them off.

60
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,041
He's a funny guy.

61
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,377
See you, pubes.

62
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:51,221
- Hey, noodle.
- Hi, guys.

63
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,432
Put on your seat belt.

64
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,936
We got our annuals.

65
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,148
- Received your annual.
- Right, received.

66
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,364
I look so much younger
than everyone.

67
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:11,825
Enjoy it while you can.

68
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,703
Mom, it's time.

69
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,249
- Can this wait till we get home?
- Pull over.

70
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,920
Tell him the truth.
Tell him how old he is.

71
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,220
He knows how old he is.

72
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,765
Kids make fun of him
because he looks young.

73
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,393
Nobody includes him.
They call him "The Narc."

74
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:40,312
- They do?
- What's a narc?

75
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:44,942
- A narcotics officer.
- What's wrong with that?

76
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,487
Come on, you guys.
It's no big deal.

77
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,365
I'm 12.
She skipped me a grade.

78
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:55,661
Big deal. I'm a year younger.
They're 13, I'm 12.

79
00:08:58,914 --> 00:08:59,957
Aren't I?

80
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:04,211
I put you in first grade when
you were 5 and didn't tell you.

81
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:08,382
- So I'm how old?
- This will scar him forever.

82
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,802
Don't be Cleopatra.
We have to be Mom and Dad.

83
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:16,515
You put too much pressure on him.
When he rebels in some odd way...

84
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,600
...don't blame me.
- How old am I?

85
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,602
You skipped an extra grade.

86
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,563
You're 11.

87
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,067
Eleven?

88
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,070
So you skipped fifth grade.

89
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:34,199
- They pad the grades too much.
- Eleven?!

90
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:39,872
You also skipped kindergarten.
I taught it to you when you were 4.

91
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:46,879
This explains so much.

92
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:53,093
- You've robbed him of an adolescence.
- Adolescence is a marketing tool.

93
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:56,638
Honey, I know you were
expecting puberty...

94
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:59,600
...but you'll have to
shine it on for a while.

95
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,519
Who needs a crowd?

96
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,231
Who put such a high premium
on being typical?

97
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,691
You're unique.

98
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,776
You're two years ahead.

99
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:13,030
Take those extra years
and do what you want.

100
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,908
Go to Europe. Take a look around.

101
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,951
See what you like.

102
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:20,746
Follow your dream.

103
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:25,167
You'll still be the youngest lawyer.
Your dad was proud.

104
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,879
He knew you were a predominately
accelerated child.

105
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,298
What about me?

106
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:36,803
You are rebellious
and ungrateful of my love.

107
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,145
Somebody's gotta be normal
around here.

108
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:47,856
11.

109
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:53,654
This song explains why I'm leaving
home to become a stewardess.

110
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:57,074
We can't talk?
We have to listen to rock music?

111
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,867
I love you.

112
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:35,612
Man, take good care
of her in San Francisco, man.

113
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,499
One day...

114
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,084
...you'll be cool.

115
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:57,050
Look under your bed.
It'll set you free.

116
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:03,932
Watch the plant.

117
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:10,314
You're 18 and I can't stop you.

118
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:21,450
She'll be back.

119
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,288
Maybe not soon.

120
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,848
Here's a theory
for you to disregard...

121
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,768
... completely.

122
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:58,732
Music, you know, true music
not just rock'n'roll, chooses you.

123
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:02,569
It lives in your car, or alone,
on your headphones...

124
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:07,157
...with vast, scenic bridges
and angelic choirs in your brain.

125
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:08,700
It's a place apart...

126
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:12,746
...from the benign lap of America.

127
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:16,208
Did you know
"The Letter" by The Box Tops...

128
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:21,088
...was a minute, 58 seconds long?
It means nothing. Nil.

129
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:24,049
They take two minutes
to accomplish...

130
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:28,345
...what Jethro Tull takes hours
to not accomplish.

131
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:32,099
You see, this is fatuous,
pseudo blubber.

132
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:35,936
You know, which is fine...

133
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,188
...but to foist it off as art...

134
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:40,941
The Doors? Jim Morrison?

135
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,026
He's a drunk, posing as a poet.

136
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,821
- I like them.
- Give me The Guess Who.

137
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:51,159
They got the courage to be drunken
buffoons, which makes them poetic.

138
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:56,790
It's an honour to have the great
rock critic and editor of Creem...

139
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,918
...back home in San Diego,
Lester Bangs.

140
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,796
Live, "American Woman"?

141
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:07,551
Have you ever...? The most brilliant
piece of gobbledygook ever!

142
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:11,471
Give me some
"White LightlWhite Heat."

143
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,015
Lggy Pop!

144
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:18,228
Amen! Put this on.
This isn't on your playlist.

145
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:21,773
- Isn't it a bit early for that?
- Not for me.

146
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:26,570
That was Lester Bangs, this is
Alice Wisdom and here is lggy Pop.

147
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:39,041
So you're the kid sending me those
articles from the school newspaper.

148
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:43,587
I've done stuff for
a local underground paper.

149
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:47,674
- What are you, the star of your school?
- They hate me.

150
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:51,345
You'll meet again
on their journey to the middle.

151
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:56,475
Your writing is good. Too bad
you missed rock'n'roll. It's over.

152
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,685
- Over?
- It's over.

153
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:04,149
You got here for the death rattle.
Last gasp. Last grope.

154
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:07,402
- At least I'm here for that.
- What do you use?

155
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:10,155
Smith-Corona Galaxis Deluxe.

156
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:12,574
You like Lou Reed?

157
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:16,161
Early stuff.
Lately, he's trying to be Bowie.

158
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,330
He should just be himself.

159
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,374
But if Bowie's doing Lou...

160
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:23,877
...and Lou's doing Bowie,
Lou's still doing Lou.

161
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:26,338
If you like Lou.

162
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,550
- You take drugs?
- No.

163
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,968
Smart kid.

164
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:34,513
I used to do speed.

165
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,892
And sometimes a little cough syrup.

166
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:42,354
I'd stay up all night,
writing and writing.

167
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:45,148
I mean, like 25 pages of dribble.

168
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:48,485
You know, about the Faces,
or Coltrane.

169
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,738
Just to fucking write.

170
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,993
All right.
It's been nice to meet you.

171
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:58,495
Keep sending me your stuff.

172
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:02,541
I can't spend all day
talking to my many fans.

173
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,334
I understand.

174
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,922
- Goodbye.
- Yeah, goodbye.

175
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:22,269
- Bye.
- Bye.

176
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:29,776
You need a ride?

177
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:35,199
No, man, I took the bus.

178
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:40,579
Once you go to L.A., you'll
have friends like crazy.

179
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:44,458
But they'll be fake friends.
They'll try to corrupt you.

180
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,836
You look honest,
they'll tell you everything.

181
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:51,882
But you cannot make friends
with the rock stars.

182
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:57,596
- Is it okay if I...
- lf you're to be a rock journalist...

183
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:05,062
You don't get much, but you'll get
free records from the record company.

184
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:13,570
There's just fucking nothing
about you that is controversial.

185
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:18,492
God, it'll get ugly.
They'll buy you drinks.

186
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,913
You'll meet girls.
They'll fly you places, offer drugs.

187
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,916
It sounds great,
but they aren't friends.

188
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:30,337
They want snobbish stories
about the rock stars' genius.

189
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:35,133
They will ruin rock and strangle
everything we love about it.

190
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,719
They're trying to buy respectability...

191
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:41,807
...for a forum that's gloriously
and righteously dumb.

192
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,518
You're smart enough to know that.

193
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:49,106
The day it ceases to be dumb
is the day it ceases to be real.

194
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:52,442
Then it just becomes
an industry of cool.

195
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:57,155
You're coming along at a very
dangerous time for rock'n'roll.

196
00:19:57,364 --> 00:20:01,660
I mean, the war is over. They won.

197
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:04,955
And 99% of what passes
for rock these days...

198
00:20:05,164 --> 00:20:08,000
...silence is more compelling.

199
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,839
So I think you should turn around,
go back and be a lawyer or something.

200
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:21,597
I can tell from your face
that you won't.

201
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:23,432
I can give you $35.

202
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,186
- Give me 1000 words on Black Sabbath.
- An assignment?

203
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,396
Yeah, yeah.

204
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:43,827
You have to make your reputation
on being honest...

205
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,787
...and...

206
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:49,458
...you know, unmerciful.

207
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:52,044
Honest.

208
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,588
Unmerciful.

209
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:59,343
If you get into a jam,
you can call me. I stay up late.

210
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:08,852
Look, a generation of Cinderellas,
and there's no slipper coming.

211
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:14,191
You wanted to be Abraham Lincoln.
You wanted to be Atticus Finch.

212
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,152
You want to get high?

213
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,738
I just have to listen.

214
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:23,992
- That's what Lester said.
- As long as this is just a hobby.

215
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:27,704
I'll pick you up right here
at 11:00 sharp.

216
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:30,791
If you get lost,
use the family whistle.

217
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,961
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

218
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,305
Don't take drugs!

219
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:47,683
"Don't take drugs!"

220
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,145
Yes, Mother!

221
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:10,706
Hi, I'm William Miller.

222
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:14,626
I'm from Creem magazine
to interview Black Sabbath.

223
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,131
Not on the list.

224
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:32,978
- Sir, I'm a journalist...
- You're not on the list.

225
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:36,148
Go to the top of the ramp
with the girls.

226
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:41,778
We won't bite!

227
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:44,031
What happens after I go to...

228
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:53,624
Who are you with?

229
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:55,083
Me?

230
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:59,129
- I'm with myself.
- Who are you with? What band?

231
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:04,218
I'm here to interview Black Sabbath.
I'm a journalist.

232
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:06,929
I'm not... Not a... You know.

233
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:08,555
You're not a what?

234
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:16,230
You're not a what?

235
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:17,731
I'm not a...

236
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:20,234
...groupie.

237
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:23,987
We are not groupies.

238
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:27,449
This is Penny Lane, man.
Show some respect.

239
00:23:27,658 --> 00:23:31,453
Groupies sleep with rock stars
because they're famous.

240
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:34,832
We're here for the music.
We are "Band Aids."

241
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,586
- She ran a school for Band Aids.
- We don't have intercourse.

242
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:43,841
We inspire the music.
We're here because of the music.

243
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:47,761
Marc Bolan broke her heart, man.
It's famous.

244
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:50,138
It's a long story.

245
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:54,142
I'm retired now.
Visiting friends.

246
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:56,144
She changed everything.

247
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:59,523
She was the one who said,
"No more sex.

248
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:02,359
No exploiting
our bodies and hearts."

249
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:04,945
- Right.
- Just blow jobs, that's it.

250
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:09,658
- It's all happening!
- It's all happening!

251
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:18,709
- It's all happening.
- This is our journalist friend.

252
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:22,337
Journalist friend,
meet Polexia Aphrodisia...

253
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:24,423
...Estrella Starr...

254
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:27,718
...and you are...
- William Miller.

255
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:31,513
- Here comes Sabbath!
- Ozzy, Tony, it's us!

256
00:24:32,598 --> 00:24:34,725
It's me, Polexia!

257
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:42,816
I think I saw Sapphire.

258
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:47,905
"Does anybody remember laughter?"

259
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:49,281
Sapphire!

260
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,201
Come on!

261
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:55,829
Passes, girls!
Come and get them!

262
00:24:56,872 --> 00:25:00,000
- Oh, no, not this one.
- Who brought Opie?

263
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:01,835
He's with us.

264
00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:06,089
- Don't go anywhere, Opie.
- I'll take care of this if I can.

265
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:27,611
Come on, boys, pick it up!
We're an hour and a half late.

266
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:30,072
I'm coming, I'm coming.

267
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:42,960
Freddy! Open up!
It's Stillwater! We're on the show!

268
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:52,761
I'm a journalist for Creem magazine.

269
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,347
Oh, the Enemy. A rock writer.

270
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:58,725
I'd like to interview you
or your band.

271
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:02,479
Look. I'm sorry,
but could you please fuck off?!

272
00:26:02,688 --> 00:26:05,899
We play for the fans,
not the critics.

273
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:12,698
Russell, Jeff...

274
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:16,451
...Ed, Larry.
I really love your band.

275
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,164
The song "Fever Dog"
is a big step forward for you.

276
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:23,792
And you guys producing it
instead of Glyn Johns...

277
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:29,047
...that was the right thing to do.
And Russell, the guitar sound...

278
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:31,675
...is incendiary.

279
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:35,345
Incendiary.

280
00:26:37,848 --> 00:26:39,266
Way to go.

281
00:26:45,564 --> 00:26:47,774
Hey, man! Don't stop there.

282
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:51,778
- I'm incendiary too, man.
- I didn't mean "fuck off."

283
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:56,783
- How are you doing?
- He's with us. This way, bro.

284
00:26:57,034 --> 00:27:00,537
- He's not on your list!
- Here's a list of people who belong.

285
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:07,085
Hey, Red Dog!

286
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:10,506
We're playing you
tomorrow night, man.

287
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:13,258
- Yeah?
- How you doing, brother?

288
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:15,135
Good to see you.

289
00:27:15,344 --> 00:27:18,430
The Allman Brothers Band's
number one roadie.

290
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:22,684
- How are the guys?
- Having a ball, man. Having a ball.

291
00:27:22,893 --> 00:27:26,563
We have an Allman Brothers
Band party, man.

292
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:30,817
Everybody's boogying,
getting off. It's like family.

293
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:34,446
We got these now.
Check that out.

294
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:38,325
You can taste the colour
with your mind.

295
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:41,328
- You'll be in Maryland?
- Yeah.

296
00:27:41,537 --> 00:27:46,166
All right. Dickey and Gregg send
you their love.

297
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:49,294
- Take it easy.
- Take it easy, brother.

298
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:51,046
Good, man.

299
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:59,680
People have a hard time explaining
rock, really explain rock'n'roll.

300
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:03,392
Maybe Pete Townshend,
but that's okay.

301
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:07,396
Rock'n'roll is a lifestyle
and a way of thinking...

302
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:10,107
...and it's not about money
and popularity.

303
00:28:10,774 --> 00:28:14,027
Although, some money
would be nice.

304
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:16,572
It's a voice that says,
"Here I am...

305
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:20,284
...and fuck you
if you can't understand me."

306
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:23,495
And one of these people
is gonna save the world.

307
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:26,456
That means rock'n'roll
can save the world...

308
00:28:26,707 --> 00:28:28,584
...all of us together.

309
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:33,338
And the chicks are great. But what
it all comes down to is that "thing."

310
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:37,759
The indefinable thing when people
catch something from your music.

311
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:42,014
- Wait, what am I talking about?
- The buzz.

312
00:28:42,264 --> 00:28:46,059
The buzz, and the chicks,
the whatever...

313
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,437
...is an offshoot of the buzz.

314
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:52,733
Like you saying you liked
"Fever Dog." That is the fucking buzz!

315
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,958
Found you a pass.

316
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:14,296
Thanks. I got in with Stillwater.

317
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:16,798
Oh, Stillwater.

318
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:38,904
Now you're mysterious.

319
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:44,743
How old are you?

320
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:47,871
- Eighteen.
- Me too.

321
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:50,249
How old are we really?

322
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:54,169
- Seventeen.
- Me too.

323
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,256
Actually, I'm 16.

324
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,383
Me too.

325
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:03,637
Isn't it funny?
The truth just sounds different.

326
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:05,597
I'm 15.

327
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:10,811
What's your real name?

328
00:30:13,522 --> 00:30:15,190
I'll never tell.

329
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:19,903
The Enemy!

330
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:23,073
Russell! Hey.

331
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:26,034
This is Penny Lane.

332
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:29,788
Penny Lane, Russell Hammond.

333
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:34,168
Pleasure.

334
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:37,921
- Penny Lane, like the song.
- Have we met?

335
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:02,988
Come here, man.
I wanna tell you something.

336
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:08,911
It's...

337
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:13,624
It's not what you put into it.
It's what you leave out.

338
00:31:13,832 --> 00:31:17,628
Listen to Marvin Gaye, a song
like "What's Happening Brother?"

339
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:21,798
There's a single "woo" at the end
of the second verse.

340
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:26,512
- You know that single woo?
- Yeah! I know that woo!

341
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:31,058
Yeah! That's what you remember.
It's the silly things.

342
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:35,312
The mistakes. There's only one
and it makes the song.

343
00:31:35,521 --> 00:31:41,026
It's what you leave out. That's
rock'n'roll, what you leave out.

344
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,030
- You're the enemy. Are you 18?
- Yes.

345
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:48,200
There you go, still young
enough to be honest.

346
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:51,245
Bring the lights down.

347
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:03,799
Hey, get the Enemy in here.

348
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:16,103
- San Diego!
- Ready, baby?

349
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:26,613
Good evening, San Diego!

350
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:28,657
Stand right over there.

351
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:32,244
Would you please welcome...

352
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:34,621
... from Troy, Michigan:

353
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:38,083
Stillwater!

354
00:34:29,528 --> 00:34:31,446
You want to come to L.A?

355
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:33,782
We'll be at the Riot House all week.

356
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:35,826
- Riot House?
- Yeah.

357
00:34:36,118 --> 00:34:38,328
The Continental Hyatt House.

358
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,455
It's on Sunset Strip.

359
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:43,125
Oh, yeah, right. Sunset Strip.

360
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:47,296
Well, tell your friend...

361
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:51,717
...Miss Penny Lane to call me.
Tell her:

362
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:56,680
It ain't California without her.
We want her around, like last summer.

363
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,974
Say it just like that.

364
00:34:59,892 --> 00:35:02,936
- Got it.
- I'm under "Harry Houdini."

365
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:06,273
I get it.

366
00:35:07,024 --> 00:35:09,735
- Come on, let's blow this spot!
- Hey, Enemy.

367
00:35:09,985 --> 00:35:12,654
Come up to L.A.,
we'll talk some more.

368
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:16,116
- Bye, Opie.
- See you later, Jeff, Polexia, Dick.

369
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:20,996
Scully, Ed. See you, Mick, Gregg.
Later, guys.

370
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:24,625
Bye, Opie.

371
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:28,337
Bye.

372
00:35:30,255 --> 00:35:32,841
Hey, Red Dog.
I'll see you later, man.

373
00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:35,636
The Wheel.
Frosty.

374
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,223
Ainsworth,
I'll see you around, man.

375
00:35:39,473 --> 00:35:41,517
- Penny!
- Hey, be cool.

376
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:43,644
Penny, you just missed Russell.

377
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:47,314
He's at the Riot House
and said for you to call.

378
00:35:47,523 --> 00:35:50,692
He's under the name Harry Houdini.

379
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:57,407
- You know about the Riot House, right?
- I think I've heard of it.

380
00:35:57,658 --> 00:35:59,785
He had a message. He said:

381
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:04,456
"It's not California without you.
We want you around like last summer."

382
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:07,584
No! He said, "Tell her it ain't
California without..."

383
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:10,504
- I get the gist.
- Right.

384
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:14,883
So how well do you guys
know each other?

385
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:26,019
Call me if you need a rescue.
We live in the same city.

386
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:29,940
I think I live in a different world.

387
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,777
Speaking of the world...

388
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:37,698
...l've made a decision.

389
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:41,869
I'm gonna live in Morocco
for one year.

390
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:48,208
I need a new crowd.

391
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,255
Do you want to come?

392
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,800
Yes.

393
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:01,805
- You sure?
- Ask me again.

394
00:37:02,431 --> 00:37:04,099
Do you want to come?

395
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:05,851
Yes, yes.

396
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:11,190
- You've gotta call me.
- Okay.

397
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:15,527
It's all happening.

398
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:17,571
It's all happening.
It's all happening.

399
00:37:20,449 --> 00:37:21,825
You all right?

400
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:24,536
Yeah, yeah. Great.

401
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:46,225
And it's not about money
and popularity.

402
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:56,235
And the chicks are great.

403
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:05,536
- Hey, Darryl.
- Hey.

404
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:16,880
- So, your sister's a stewardess now.
- Yeah.

405
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:18,632
She and Mom are still...

406
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:23,512
I'd say not speaking,
but I don't know that they ever did.

407
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,139
The things we did
inside these walls.

408
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:28,684
That's okay.
I don't wanna know.

409
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:31,979
- It is my room now.
- We flew the friendly skies.

410
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:33,814
Okay, okay.

411
00:38:36,942 --> 00:38:38,110
You seem cooler.

412
00:38:39,611 --> 00:38:42,447
I am thinking
about going to Morocco.

413
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:45,868
Tell me if you need
a little help with your mom.

414
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:50,122
- A little may not be enough.
- She still freaks me out.

415
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,457
- She's famous.
- Listen...

416
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:55,502
Go ahead and do
whatever you were doing.

417
00:38:55,711 --> 00:39:00,174
- I'm just gonna hang in here a moment.
- Okay.

418
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:20,736
I worry about drunk drivers.

419
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:23,197
Mom, I'm 15.

420
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:24,990
Right?

421
00:39:25,616 --> 00:39:28,076
Yes. You're 15.

422
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:31,455
And, here's that money
I owe you.

423
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:35,417
Your father's favourite joke.
I don't do it as well.

424
00:39:35,626 --> 00:39:38,295
No, I thought
that was pretty good.

425
00:39:38,504 --> 00:39:41,131
Small bills on the outside.
Call if they're drunk.

426
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:44,676
I will call you if anyone,
anywhere, gets drunk.

427
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:48,430
- And don't take drugs.
- Very funny.

428
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:50,933
See? Sense of humour.

429
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,811
Have fun at the dance.
I'm glad you're making friends.

430
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:57,606
- Mom, stay.
- Okay.

431
00:39:58,857 --> 00:40:00,108
Love you.

432
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:01,568
Goodbye.

433
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:19,211
I always tell the girls,
"Never take it seriously.

434
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:22,047
Never take it seriously,
you never get hurt.

435
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:24,174
If you never get hurt,
you always have fun.

436
00:40:24,424 --> 00:40:26,718
And if you ever get lonely...

437
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:31,306
...you just go to the record store
and visit your friends."

438
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:34,518
- So you and Russell...
- No!

439
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:39,731
Russell has a girlfriend,
and I can't even say her name.

440
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:55,789
It's all happening.
I'm about to use you as protection.

441
00:40:55,998 --> 00:41:00,502
These guys are with Alice Cooper.
I'll pretend I don't know them.

442
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:02,838
Does Alice know you're here?

443
00:41:03,046 --> 00:41:06,550
I'm just showing my very dear friend
William Miller around.

444
00:41:06,758 --> 00:41:09,303
He's a very good friend
of Lester Bangs.

445
00:41:09,511 --> 00:41:12,890
I'm responsible for his moral conduct.

446
00:41:13,098 --> 00:41:15,893
Penny Lane!
God's gift to rock'n'roll.

447
00:41:16,101 --> 00:41:18,729
I'm retired.
And don't argue with me!

448
00:41:18,979 --> 00:41:24,234
- Retired? Again?
- It's Reg. Humble Pie's road manager.

449
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:27,571
Penny, come to Portland with us.

450
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:29,823
- Have we met?
- Have we met?!

451
00:41:30,032 --> 00:41:33,994
I've made a decision.
I'm going travelling to India.

452
00:41:34,203 --> 00:41:36,538
And then, I'll learn to play
the violin.

453
00:41:36,747 --> 00:41:40,459
Then, I'll go to college
for one year.

454
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:44,004
There's nothing they can teach you
in college.

455
00:41:44,796 --> 00:41:46,757
Call Alice, under the name
Bob Hope.

456
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:51,512
- I heard you were with Russell.
- Please, I throw the little ones back!

457
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,222
I lost my head!

458
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:58,101
Martin Bell's a fucking asshole.
And I'm in love with Jeff.

459
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,436
Polexia!

460
00:42:06,026 --> 00:42:07,611
Harry Houdini, please.

461
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,030
- Houdini. Harry Houdini!
- It was Sable.

462
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:13,534
- Who's Sable?
- We had this really great night.

463
00:42:13,784 --> 00:42:18,747
And he said it was going to mean
something. And I'm in love with Jeff!

464
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:30,634
I saw them on the 7th floor.

465
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:34,763
Mr. Jimmy Page, Mr. John Paul Jones,
Mr. Robert Plant.

466
00:42:34,972 --> 00:42:36,473
Mr. Robert Plant signed...

467
00:42:38,183 --> 00:42:40,602
...my T-shirt five minutes ago.

468
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:43,981
Dude, please don't smear it.

469
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:46,024
He touched this pen.

470
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:48,735
- Vic is a Zeppelin fan.
- I picked that up.

471
00:42:48,944 --> 00:42:51,488
He tours with them,
but not "with" them.

472
00:42:51,738 --> 00:42:54,533
Yeah, they're on the 12th floor now.

473
00:42:54,867 --> 00:42:57,035
There's no bigger
Zeppelin fan than Vic.

474
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:06,253
Very dear, very close
friend of Lester Bangs.

475
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,755
William Miller.

476
00:43:10,132 --> 00:43:12,176
Hey, you're that comedian.

477
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:15,846
- Leonard!
- Blow me!

478
00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:20,767
Okay, time to put on
the lampshade.

479
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:26,273
Ladies and gentlemen!

480
00:43:27,232 --> 00:43:30,903
At this time, please extinguish
all smoking materials...

481
00:43:31,153 --> 00:43:34,781
...for the captain has turned on
the "No Smoking" sign.

482
00:43:35,032 --> 00:43:38,744
Your seats and tray tables
should be locked...

483
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:41,413
...and in their full
upright position.

484
00:43:51,048 --> 00:43:52,674
The hell with it.

485
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:55,802
- Play on.
- Miss Penny Lane.

486
00:43:57,012 --> 00:43:58,514
Thank you. Thank you.

487
00:44:03,936 --> 00:44:08,315
Act One, in which she pretends
she doesn't care...

488
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,400
...about him.

489
00:44:13,153 --> 00:44:18,116
Act Two, in which he pretends
he doesn't care about her...

490
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:21,036
...but he goes right for her.

491
00:44:25,707 --> 00:44:30,462
Act Three, in which it all plays out
the way she planned it.

492
00:44:31,213 --> 00:44:33,340
She'll eat him alive.

493
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:34,800
We've gotta stop them.

494
00:44:35,008 --> 00:44:36,677
Stop them?

495
00:44:38,554 --> 00:44:42,391
You were her excuse for coming here.

496
00:44:46,687 --> 00:44:48,355
I need ice.

497
00:45:01,285 --> 00:45:03,954
I'm worried about people
using her.

498
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:09,710
She brings out the good in everybody
else, but what do they do for her?

499
00:45:10,419 --> 00:45:14,214
It kills me.
Do you have any pot?

500
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:18,051
No. Not on me.

501
00:45:19,303 --> 00:45:22,347
- Do you smoke?
- No.

502
00:45:24,016 --> 00:45:26,602
But I grow it.

503
00:45:27,936 --> 00:45:29,146
Yeah.

504
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:32,608
- Grow it.
- You're funny.

505
00:45:32,858 --> 00:45:38,614
Funny. If you were only taller and
English and rich and a guitar player.

506
00:45:38,822 --> 00:45:41,158
And older.

507
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:45,078
I'd...
I'd be somebody else.

508
00:45:45,287 --> 00:45:48,332
Yeah, good point.

509
00:45:50,584 --> 00:45:52,336
The Enemy.

510
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:56,548
I'm always around if
you wanna talk more.

511
00:45:56,757 --> 00:45:58,509
- Okay.
- All right.

512
00:45:59,384 --> 00:46:02,971
Bless me, Father,
for I may sin tonight.

513
00:46:27,663 --> 00:46:30,249
How does it end?

514
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:31,542
What?

515
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,797
The story about the girl who dumps the
guy who has the ex, ex-wife.

516
00:46:38,048 --> 00:46:40,634
Calls her a hundred, okay...

517
00:46:40,843 --> 00:46:46,265
...five times and doesn't even leave
a pass in San Diego.

518
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:48,267
Wake up.

519
00:46:49,226 --> 00:46:51,019
I'm retired.

520
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:57,401
I never believed you anyway.
You're too good-looking and talented.

521
00:46:57,609 --> 00:47:01,113
You're retired like Frank Sinatra
is retired.

522
00:47:01,321 --> 00:47:06,076
Miss Penny Lane, let me tell
you what rock'n'roll will miss.

523
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:09,204
The day that you truly retire.

524
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:15,043
The way you turn a hotel room
into a home.

525
00:47:15,252 --> 00:47:17,963
The way you pick up strays
wherever you go.

526
00:47:19,673 --> 00:47:23,468
The way you know the words
to every song.

527
00:47:23,677 --> 00:47:26,263
Every song.
Especially the bad ones.

528
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:29,057
Mostly the bad ones.

529
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:33,353
That green coat
in the middle of summer.

530
00:47:34,938 --> 00:47:38,233
The real name
that you won't reveal.

531
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:45,365
I could keep going,
but my glass is full.

532
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:47,784
Damn.

533
00:48:08,138 --> 00:48:10,390
Come to Arizona?

534
00:48:11,475 --> 00:48:12,601
Never.

535
00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:17,481
We leave Thursday morning at 9 a.m.,
and pack light this time. Jesus.

536
00:48:30,577 --> 00:48:32,788
- William Miller?
- This is he.

537
00:48:33,038 --> 00:48:36,375
This is Ben Fong-Torres.
I'm the music editor at Rolling Stone.

538
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:40,546
We got some copies of your stories
from the San Diego Door.

539
00:48:40,921 --> 00:48:43,715
- Is this the same William Miller?
- Yes, it is.

540
00:48:43,966 --> 00:48:47,636
"Voice of God," "Howling Dogs,"
"The Spirit of Rock'n'roll."

541
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:50,097
- This is good stuff, man.
- Thanks.

542
00:48:51,098 --> 00:48:52,724
Thanks. Thanks.

543
00:48:52,975 --> 00:48:55,352
I think you should be
writing for us. Any ideas?

544
00:48:58,856 --> 00:49:01,650
- How about Stillwater?
- Stillwater?

545
00:49:02,484 --> 00:49:06,196
"Hardworking band makes good."
New album out, their third.

546
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:08,699
Starting to do something. Crazy.

547
00:49:09,032 --> 00:49:12,452
Let's do 3000 words.
We'll join the band on the road.

548
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:14,454
Don't let the band pay for anything.

549
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:18,667
We can only pay, let me see,
3000 words...

550
00:49:20,502 --> 00:49:21,587
$700.

551
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:25,632
All right, a grand.

552
00:49:26,884 --> 00:49:29,720
What's your background?
Are you a journalism major?

553
00:49:31,221 --> 00:49:33,348
- Yeah.
- What college?

554
00:49:33,557 --> 00:49:36,935
I need you to do that thing
that fixes the garbage disposal.

555
00:49:43,525 --> 00:49:46,904
I certainly know how my lady gets
when you don't snap to it.

556
00:49:47,446 --> 00:49:49,740
- Crazy.
- Crazy.

557
00:49:50,866 --> 00:49:51,909
Stillwater?

558
00:49:52,409 --> 00:49:53,785
Beware, beware...

559
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:56,580
...of Rolling Stone.
They'll change your story...

560
00:49:58,248 --> 00:50:01,502
...they'll rewrite it, you know,
turn it into swill.

561
00:50:01,752 --> 00:50:04,296
Besides that,
what would be wrong with it?

562
00:50:05,631 --> 00:50:08,717
You got starry eyes, my friend.

563
00:50:09,343 --> 00:50:12,471
Look, do the story.

564
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:16,016
Who cares, you know?
It'll be good for you.

565
00:50:16,558 --> 00:50:19,061
Remember this: Don't do it...

566
00:50:19,311 --> 00:50:22,606
...to make friends with people
who are trying to use you...

567
00:50:22,856 --> 00:50:27,027
...to further
the big-business desire...

568
00:50:27,277 --> 00:50:30,614
... to glorify worthless rock stars
like Stillwater.

569
00:50:30,906 --> 00:50:33,742
Don't let those
swill merchants rewrite you.

570
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,579
- "Swill merchants." That's good.
- Yeah, swill merchants.

571
00:50:39,832 --> 00:50:42,125
- What are you listening to?
- Stillwater.

572
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:45,420
Stillwater?
Fucking kid's doing drugs.

573
00:50:45,963 --> 00:50:49,091
No, no, no, no.

574
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:52,928
No more than four days and I want
a phone number where you are.

575
00:50:53,178 --> 00:50:57,391
Call me twice a day, and do not
miss more than one test!

576
00:51:01,562 --> 00:51:03,647
And no drugs.

577
00:51:04,231 --> 00:51:07,192
Oh, this is a big mistake.

578
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:31,133
Come on, Doris, you darling bus.
You can make it.

579
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:47,107
- This is what I was talking about.
- Russell, excuse me.

580
00:51:47,316 --> 00:51:50,944
I was wondering if we could
talk when we get to Phoenix.

581
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:54,781
I want to interview everybody
and want to start with...

582
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:57,326
...just you and me.
- Absolutely.

583
00:51:57,784 --> 00:52:00,204
I've got a thing in a couple days.

584
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:04,124
- What?
- Oh, it's a thing.

585
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:06,960
Where you go there
to graduate.

586
00:52:08,629 --> 00:52:09,671
School.

587
00:52:11,465 --> 00:52:14,051
I never graduated.
Look what happened.

588
00:52:14,259 --> 00:52:17,054
You're here interviewing me.

589
00:52:19,181 --> 00:52:21,725
No, no, no, no.

590
00:52:22,684 --> 00:52:27,815
Don't put that in Rolling Stone.
In our bios, we all graduated.

591
00:52:28,023 --> 00:52:29,817
Him with honours.

592
00:52:30,192 --> 00:52:32,820
We'll figure out something
later, okay?

593
00:52:34,154 --> 00:52:35,864
Just enjoy the ride.

594
00:52:36,114 --> 00:52:38,951
- Keep playing that song.
- All right.

595
00:52:57,886 --> 00:53:01,640
I need to stay in your room.
Russell's in a bad mood.

596
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:05,894
He's very Bob Dylan in Don't
Look Back. He's trying to write.

597
00:53:06,103 --> 00:53:08,939
Yeah, sure.

598
00:53:09,148 --> 00:53:10,607
- Yeah?
- Sure.

599
00:53:10,816 --> 00:53:12,568
You okay?

600
00:53:12,943 --> 00:53:14,736
Yeah.

601
00:53:32,546 --> 00:53:35,257
Come by in a few minutes
for that interview.

602
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:36,925
Sure.

603
00:53:39,761 --> 00:53:41,680
Is this Mr. Miller?

604
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:42,973
Yeah.

605
00:53:43,223 --> 00:53:45,392
You have a message from Elaine.

606
00:53:45,642 --> 00:53:46,935
Your mother.

607
00:53:47,603 --> 00:53:49,229
She's a handful.

608
00:53:50,981 --> 00:53:53,525
- I know.
- She freaked me out.

609
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:56,737
Tell her to stop.

610
00:54:05,537 --> 00:54:07,247
I'm worried, man.

611
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:11,627
No, you can trust him.
He's a fan.

612
00:54:11,835 --> 00:54:13,670
But it's Rolling Stone.

613
00:54:13,921 --> 00:54:18,133
He looks harmless, but he represents
the magazine that trashed "Layla"...

614
00:54:18,383 --> 00:54:21,845
...broke up Cream, ripped every album
Led Zeppelin ever made.

615
00:54:22,095 --> 00:54:26,308
Don't forget the rules. He is
the Enemy. He writes what he sees.

616
00:54:26,558 --> 00:54:30,145
If I don't get into a room
and take a Valium...

617
00:54:30,354 --> 00:54:33,315
Although it would be cool
to be on the cover.

618
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:36,026
You're gonna get me in trouble.

619
00:54:37,236 --> 00:54:40,072
You're so trying to get
me into so much trouble.

620
00:54:42,616 --> 00:54:43,659
Oh, my God.

621
00:54:44,243 --> 00:54:47,621
Simon Kirke from Bad Company
is by the pool.

622
00:54:57,923 --> 00:54:59,508
Housekeeping.

623
00:55:00,634 --> 00:55:02,094
Housekeeping.

624
00:55:03,345 --> 00:55:04,680
Go away!

625
00:55:05,806 --> 00:55:07,683
Should I come by later?

626
00:55:08,058 --> 00:55:11,645
Yes. I'm in too truthful a mood!

627
00:55:11,895 --> 00:55:14,356
- Maybe that's a good thing.
- Go away!

628
00:55:17,526 --> 00:55:18,694
You okay?

629
00:55:18,944 --> 00:55:20,279
Yeah.

630
00:55:21,071 --> 00:55:22,114
Go away!

631
00:55:22,322 --> 00:55:25,534
Don't worry. Come to
the radio interview tonight. Okay?

632
00:55:25,784 --> 00:55:26,952
Go away!

633
00:55:28,162 --> 00:55:29,496
- Bye.
- You're so rude.

634
00:56:30,474 --> 00:56:34,186
The guitar and songwriting
of Russell Hammond.

635
00:56:34,394 --> 00:56:39,817
Vocal stylings of
Jeff "Bebay." Jeff "Babey." "Babay."

636
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:43,904
- "Bebe."
- Bebe.

637
00:56:44,112 --> 00:56:45,197
"Fever Dog."

638
00:56:45,489 --> 00:56:47,574
The band is Stillwater.

639
00:56:47,783 --> 00:56:51,453
Watch with your mind
as they materialize.

640
00:56:58,377 --> 00:57:01,922
Look at the dogs wearing the funny
hats juggling just for you...

641
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:05,092
...freaks and family.

642
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,635
It's Quince...

643
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:10,639
...with Stillwater, here, live.
It's the Night Circus.

644
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:15,561
Every minute a baby
is born somewhere.

645
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:18,063
Life. Death.

646
00:57:18,272 --> 00:57:20,816
Hermetically sealed bags
of human emotion.

647
00:57:21,233 --> 00:57:23,485
Bags of love.

648
00:57:24,027 --> 00:57:25,779
Bags of kindness.

649
00:57:29,575 --> 00:57:31,243
How'd y'all get together?

650
00:57:37,082 --> 00:57:41,170
Not to get into a me thing,
but I did start the band...

651
00:57:41,378 --> 00:57:46,300
...sometime ago and I placed
an ad in a magazine called Peaches.

652
00:57:46,508 --> 00:57:48,886
And Russell Hammond answered.

653
00:57:49,344 --> 00:57:50,387
Peaches.

654
00:57:50,596 --> 00:57:54,016
It was a gift from God.
Nobody plays like Russell.

655
00:57:54,892 --> 00:57:57,561
Shit, man. Thank you.

656
00:58:00,731 --> 00:58:03,775
You might wanna hit
that delay button, Quincy.

657
00:58:14,077 --> 00:58:16,121
Quince?

658
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:22,336
Now we're talking, right?

659
00:58:24,004 --> 00:58:25,464
Right?

660
00:58:26,089 --> 00:58:30,010
Why the fuck wait for an interview
to say something nice about me?

661
00:58:30,219 --> 00:58:35,390
Why not say it to my fucking face? I
tell you every time you nail something.

662
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,768
Everybody pays you compliments.

663
00:58:37,976 --> 00:58:43,732
It's not my fucking job
to kiss your fucking ass.

664
00:58:43,941 --> 00:58:48,779
Whose fucking job is it?
Because my ass is dying for a kiss.

665
00:58:48,987 --> 00:58:50,989
I know yours is too.

666
00:58:51,198 --> 00:58:53,408
It's my fucking job.
I think you're all geniuses.

667
00:58:53,617 --> 00:58:57,204
And to all the folks out there:
Smegma.

668
00:58:57,412 --> 00:58:58,455
Nice.

669
00:58:58,664 --> 00:58:59,873
Fellas.

670
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:01,834
Feces.

671
00:59:03,919 --> 00:59:06,255
The song is "Love Thing."

672
00:59:06,505 --> 00:59:09,091
Your mind is starting
to take effect.

673
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:12,177
They've come to watch you
swallow fire.

674
00:59:12,386 --> 00:59:13,679
You scream...

675
00:59:13,887 --> 00:59:15,764
...soundlessly...

676
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:18,475
...on the Night Circus.

677
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:25,941
- I thought that went well.
- Yeah. Absolutely.

678
00:59:29,778 --> 00:59:30,821
Pronto.

679
00:59:31,029 --> 00:59:34,158
- May I speak with William?
- He's in the bar with the band.

680
00:59:34,408 --> 00:59:38,120
They're back from the radio station.
Is this Maryann with the pot?

681
00:59:40,956 --> 00:59:41,999
Hello?

682
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:47,462
No. This is not
Maryann with the pot.

683
00:59:47,713 --> 00:59:49,840
This is Elaine, his mother.

684
00:59:52,384 --> 00:59:54,678
Could you give William
a message, please?

685
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:58,515
Tell him to call home immediately.
And also tell him...

686
00:59:59,474 --> 01:00:02,686
...I know what's going on.

687
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:06,732
Okay. But I'm just gonna say this,
and I'm gonna stand by it:

688
01:00:06,982 --> 01:00:09,276
You should be really proud of him.

689
01:00:09,526 --> 01:00:12,154
Because I know men,
and I'll bet you do too.

690
01:00:12,404 --> 01:00:15,282
He respects women,
and he likes women.

691
01:00:15,491 --> 01:00:18,619
And let's just pause
and appreciate a man like that.

692
01:00:18,869 --> 01:00:21,997
You created him out of thin air.
You raised him right.

693
01:00:22,247 --> 01:00:24,708
He's having a great time.
He's doing a good job.

694
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:29,630
Don't worry, he's still a virgin,
and we're all looking out for him.

695
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:33,300
You know? That's more than I've
ever said to my own parents.

696
01:00:34,676 --> 01:00:36,011
So there you go.

697
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:40,849
This is a maid speaking,
by the way.

698
01:00:41,892 --> 01:00:45,312
- Can you please hold it down?
- Sorry, ma'am!

699
01:00:50,776 --> 01:00:54,905
Russell. So, what is it
you love about music?

700
01:00:55,364 --> 01:00:58,659
Shut that thing off and I'll tell you
the truth, all right?

701
01:01:01,203 --> 01:01:05,499
Look. Fuck, I trust you, so I'm
just gonna lay this right on you.

702
01:01:08,502 --> 01:01:10,379
Just make us look cool.

703
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:17,219
I will quote you
warmly and accurately.

704
01:01:17,469 --> 01:01:20,764
Well, that's what I'm worried about.

705
01:01:22,057 --> 01:01:26,311
You see, some of us have girlfriends
back home, you know?

706
01:01:27,396 --> 01:01:29,731
Some of us have wives.

707
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:33,861
And some of the people
that you meet on the road...

708
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:36,905
...are really amazing people.

709
01:01:43,328 --> 01:01:44,454
Like you.

710
01:01:47,541 --> 01:01:50,210
Some of the stuff that happens,
it's good for...

711
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:53,297
...a few people to know about,
as opposed to, say...

712
01:01:55,632 --> 01:01:56,925
...a million people.

713
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:01,221
- Understand what I'm trying to say?
- Yeah.

714
01:02:03,223 --> 01:02:05,851
They say you're dangerous.

715
01:02:06,518 --> 01:02:09,480
You see everything.
Most people...

716
01:02:09,688 --> 01:02:11,899
...are just waiting to talk.

717
01:02:12,107 --> 01:02:14,193
But you listen.

718
01:02:15,861 --> 01:02:19,740
I grew up with these guys,
but I can't play all that I can play.

719
01:02:20,449 --> 01:02:23,076
I'm past them, as musicians, but...

720
01:02:23,285 --> 01:02:26,622
...the more popular we get,
the bigger their houses get...

721
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:29,124
...the more responsibilities,
the pressure.

722
01:02:29,374 --> 01:02:33,170
The harder it gets
for me to walk out on them.

723
01:02:33,378 --> 01:02:35,047
Then you forget.

724
01:02:35,255 --> 01:02:39,426
Forget what it's like
to be a fan.

725
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:43,388
It doesn't sound like music anymore.

726
01:02:43,597 --> 01:02:45,057
It sounds like...

727
01:02:46,183 --> 01:02:49,228
...lifestyle maintenance,
or something.

728
01:02:49,937 --> 01:02:52,773
"Lifestyle maintenance."
That's...

729
01:02:55,776 --> 01:02:58,195
I used to be able to hear...

730
01:03:00,697 --> 01:03:02,866
...the sounds of the world.

731
01:03:03,116 --> 01:03:07,162
To me, it sounded like music.

732
01:03:08,247 --> 01:03:10,082
Now, I don't hear it...

733
01:03:10,999 --> 01:03:12,584
...anymore.

734
01:03:21,176 --> 01:03:23,554
Do you understand what I'm saying?

735
01:03:23,804 --> 01:03:26,265
Yeah.

736
01:03:30,185 --> 01:03:32,312
What am I doing?

737
01:03:32,646 --> 01:03:38,068
I'm telling secrets to the one guy
you don't tell secrets to.

738
01:03:40,487 --> 01:03:41,530
No.

739
01:03:43,699 --> 01:03:45,492
We'll do the interview tomorrow.

740
01:03:47,536 --> 01:03:49,037
- Okay.
- Okay.

741
01:03:49,955 --> 01:03:52,040
So tonight it's...

742
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:53,834
Well, friends.

743
01:03:54,042 --> 01:03:56,628
- Yeah, right.
- We trust you.

744
01:03:56,962 --> 01:03:58,672
Larry Fellows...

745
01:03:58,922 --> 01:04:01,925
What is your role in Stillwater?

746
01:04:02,176 --> 01:04:06,180
What is the chemical
you add to the chemistry?

747
01:04:09,224 --> 01:04:11,185
I'm the bass player.

748
01:04:12,478 --> 01:04:13,896
Right.

749
01:04:14,396 --> 01:04:17,232
And when you take that away...

750
01:04:17,441 --> 01:04:20,569
...what would be missing,
stylistically?

751
01:04:20,819 --> 01:04:23,071
What chemical?

752
01:04:26,366 --> 01:04:28,285
A bass?

753
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:31,413
Okay.

754
01:05:18,502 --> 01:05:21,755
- What's going on?
- Russell got electrocuted!

755
01:05:25,634 --> 01:05:27,719
Okay, everybody be cool!

756
01:05:28,595 --> 01:05:32,141
Come on! Let's get on the bus!
Let's go!

757
01:05:32,391 --> 01:05:35,644
Who's taking care of us?
What about the gear?

758
01:05:35,853 --> 01:05:37,646
I'll deal with it. Get on the bus!

759
01:05:37,896 --> 01:05:40,482
- Come on! Let's go!
- Hey, cowboy.

760
01:05:40,691 --> 01:05:42,651
- You the manager?
- That and more.

761
01:05:42,901 --> 01:05:44,695
You didn't finish your full set, man.

762
01:05:44,945 --> 01:05:48,615
Listen, pal. Your shoddy stage setup
almost killed my guitarist!

763
01:05:48,866 --> 01:05:52,035
You trashed my dressing room
and didn't do 25 minutes!

764
01:05:52,286 --> 01:05:55,038
- Don't fuck with my band's safety!
- Fuck you, man!

765
01:05:55,247 --> 01:05:57,457
I'm gonna report you
to every promoter in this country!

766
01:05:57,708 --> 01:06:01,128
- I'll call Frank Barcelona!
- You don't know him!

767
01:06:01,336 --> 01:06:03,088
You're all amateurs!

768
01:06:03,922 --> 01:06:05,507
- Come on!
- You want it?

769
01:06:05,757 --> 01:06:07,759
What do you got?

770
01:06:10,888 --> 01:06:12,556
Watch the shirt, fuck!

771
01:06:12,764 --> 01:06:14,975
I'm gonna kick your ass.

772
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:17,060
Take it easy, man.

773
01:06:17,269 --> 01:06:19,313
I hope you got a lawyer.

774
01:06:20,063 --> 01:06:23,192
Make a live album!
This is your last tour!

775
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,987
What? What? What is that?
What are you, Bruce Lee?

776
01:06:27,196 --> 01:06:28,822
Come on.

777
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,701
Take it easy.

778
01:06:33,452 --> 01:06:34,953
Lock the gates!

779
01:06:36,038 --> 01:06:39,291
Go through the fucking gate.

780
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,585
Lock the gates on these fuckheads!

781
01:06:41,793 --> 01:06:44,254
- Where's my goddamn cart?
- William?

782
01:06:48,258 --> 01:06:50,928
I forgot to tell you.
Your mom called.

783
01:06:51,136 --> 01:06:53,472
She says you gotta
call home immediately.

784
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:57,184
And she says to tell you,
"I know what's going on."

785
01:06:57,392 --> 01:07:00,562
So I'll see you guys in Topeka, okay?

786
01:07:05,275 --> 01:07:08,695
Amateurs! You don't know
who you're dealing with!

787
01:07:08,904 --> 01:07:09,947
Lock the gates!

788
01:07:16,203 --> 01:07:18,664
- You want to buy a gate?
- Yeah!

789
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:24,795
You just bought a gate!

790
01:07:46,608 --> 01:07:49,069
Hey. Give that to me, William.

791
01:07:53,574 --> 01:07:56,201
Give me that.

792
01:08:04,668 --> 01:08:05,711
Russell, wake up.

793
01:08:06,712 --> 01:08:09,882
Wake up. It's a girls' running team.

794
01:08:10,883 --> 01:08:12,467
Goddamn!

795
01:08:12,801 --> 01:08:15,179
Let it go, fellas. Let it go, buddy.

796
01:08:15,387 --> 01:08:17,431
When are we getting to Topeka, man?

797
01:08:17,639 --> 01:08:20,684
- Larry, you're a sick individual.
- Wake up, man.

798
01:08:21,185 --> 01:08:24,188
Look at all the tasty-looking
high school girls.

799
01:08:24,396 --> 01:08:27,858
We can't stop the bus
for every girl in shorts.

800
01:08:28,066 --> 01:08:30,486
Hey, when we go to Morocco...

801
01:08:30,694 --> 01:08:33,155
...we should wear
completely different clothes...

802
01:08:33,363 --> 01:08:35,491
...and be completely different people.

803
01:08:36,033 --> 01:08:37,993
What will our names be?

804
01:08:47,419 --> 01:08:49,213
What do you think of Russell?

805
01:08:52,007 --> 01:08:53,383
I like him.

806
01:08:53,717 --> 01:08:57,137
But that's between us.
Because I am a professional.

807
01:08:57,805 --> 01:09:01,475
Give them a break.
There are problems in the band.

808
01:09:01,725 --> 01:09:05,437
- Off the record.
- What problems?

809
01:09:06,271 --> 01:09:07,898
Okay, I got it.

810
01:09:08,148 --> 01:09:12,736
Your name should be Spencer,
and mine will be Jane.

811
01:09:14,696 --> 01:09:19,409
- I can't keep up with you.
- Oh, no one can.

812
01:09:23,413 --> 01:09:26,291
You're coming to Cleveland, right?

813
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:31,088
Cleveland, Ohio?
Oh, no, no, no.

814
01:09:31,296 --> 01:09:34,800
I have to get my interview
with Russell before Greenville.

815
01:09:35,217 --> 01:09:40,180
- You've got to help me, okay?
- Here's the thing about Russell.

816
01:09:40,389 --> 01:09:41,723
He's my last project.

817
01:09:41,932 --> 01:09:46,436
I only do this for a very few people,
and I think we should do it together.

818
01:09:46,645 --> 01:09:50,357
Because all the guys are good,
but he could be great.

819
01:09:54,153 --> 01:09:55,571
What's your real name?

820
01:10:01,285 --> 01:10:03,287
All right, let's go.

821
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,170
Oh, it's okay. I'm easy to forget.

822
01:10:11,378 --> 01:10:12,921
Just leave me behind!

823
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:16,925
I'm only the fucking lead singer!

824
01:10:19,678 --> 01:10:24,475
So, Ed Vallencourt,
what do you love about music?

825
01:10:39,823 --> 01:10:42,451
You said you'd tell me where you were.

826
01:10:42,701 --> 01:10:44,870
- And call twice a day.
- I know!

827
01:10:45,704 --> 01:10:48,665
- You said you wouldn't miss any tests.
- I'll be home for graduation.

828
01:10:48,874 --> 01:10:50,542
- Mom...
- Where are you?

829
01:10:50,751 --> 01:10:53,670
Right now, Topeka,
then Greenville, then home.

830
01:10:53,879 --> 01:10:56,757
What about graduation?
We had an agreement.

831
01:10:56,965 --> 01:10:59,301
I'm sorry I didn't call
you yesterday.

832
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:03,430
I miss you and I don't understand
why I've driven my kids so far away.

833
01:11:03,639 --> 01:11:06,433
By all rules, don't I
get you for another three years?

834
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:09,812
Was I not fun?

835
01:11:10,229 --> 01:11:11,438
Yes.

836
01:11:12,397 --> 01:11:14,233
This is Beth from Denver.

837
01:11:14,441 --> 01:11:17,319
She's one of the legendary
original Band Aids.

838
01:11:17,528 --> 01:11:20,739
- She's clairvoyant!
- I can't read your mind or anything.

839
01:11:20,948 --> 01:11:23,826
I mean, I pick up things
here and there.

840
01:11:24,034 --> 01:11:25,369
Estrella says hi.

841
01:11:25,577 --> 01:11:29,456
- She says I can stay in your room.
- Sure.

842
01:11:29,748 --> 01:11:31,917
Great! I've got some...

843
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:34,294
...hydroponic pot!

844
01:11:34,503 --> 01:11:37,756
Wow, your aura is really fantastic!

845
01:11:37,965 --> 01:11:41,009
- It's this beautiful purple colour.
- I love you.

846
01:11:41,218 --> 01:11:43,178
I missed the last thing you said.

847
01:11:43,387 --> 01:11:45,806
- Your aura is purple!
- I love you.

848
01:11:46,014 --> 01:11:48,392
- What?
- Purple! It's purple!

849
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,562
- Mom, what?
- Your aura is purple!

850
01:11:51,770 --> 01:11:54,189
I miss you and I love you!

851
01:11:54,398 --> 01:11:56,358
I love you.

852
01:12:26,138 --> 01:12:27,181
All right.

853
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:29,975
Fire away. I'm ready.

854
01:12:30,184 --> 01:12:32,561
Do you have to be sad
to write a sad song...

855
01:12:32,769 --> 01:12:34,646
...and in love to write a love song?

856
01:12:35,105 --> 01:12:38,025
Is a song better
if it really happened to you?

857
01:12:38,233 --> 01:12:42,905
Like "Love Thing." Where did you
write that? Who is it about?

858
01:12:44,531 --> 01:12:46,450
When did you get so professional?

859
01:12:48,744 --> 01:12:53,248
Gentlemen, your first
T-shirts have arrived.

860
01:13:13,268 --> 01:13:17,272
It's the record company's mistake,
and they will pay.

861
01:13:18,774 --> 01:13:22,027
T-shirts are gone... band happy.
All right?

862
01:13:24,363 --> 01:13:28,408
Can we just skip the vibe and go
straight to us laughing about this?

863
01:13:28,617 --> 01:13:29,660
Yeah, okay.

864
01:13:29,993 --> 01:13:32,246
I can see you want to get into it.

865
01:13:32,454 --> 01:13:36,542
How can you tell?
I'm just one of the out-of-focus guys.

866
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:38,502
Here.

867
01:13:39,795 --> 01:13:42,172
Let's take a good look at it,
all right?

868
01:13:43,841 --> 01:13:45,968
See, you love this T-shirt.

869
01:13:46,176 --> 01:13:48,345
It lets you say
everything you want.

870
01:13:49,012 --> 01:13:51,181
Well, it speaks pretty loudly to me.

871
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:54,059
It's a T-shirt.

872
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:57,354
Do you give a shit about a T-shirt?

873
01:13:57,563 --> 01:14:01,191
I'm just hungry. Let's just go
find some barbecue or something.

874
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,026
I'll always tell you the truth.

875
01:14:03,235 --> 01:14:04,778
You doing coke again?

876
01:14:05,529 --> 01:14:07,364
Oh, yeah, all the time.

877
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:09,950
This is big stuff, man.

878
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:13,036
From the very beginning,
we said I'm the front man...

879
01:14:13,245 --> 01:14:15,622
...and you're the guitarist
with mystique.

880
01:14:15,831 --> 01:14:17,875
That's the dynamic we agreed on.

881
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:21,378
Page, Plant. Mick, Keith.

882
01:14:22,171 --> 01:14:23,839
Blackmore, Gillan.

883
01:14:24,089 --> 01:14:26,258
But somehow it's all turning around.

884
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:28,969
We have got to control
what's happening!

885
01:14:29,344 --> 01:14:32,347
- There's a responsibility here.
- Excuse me.

886
01:14:32,556 --> 01:14:36,018
Didn't we all get into this
to avoid responsibility?

887
01:14:36,226 --> 01:14:38,979
I can't say any more
with the writer here.

888
01:14:39,771 --> 01:14:42,733
Trust him. Say what you want.

889
01:14:42,941 --> 01:14:47,571
I work as hard, or harder,
than anybody on that stage.

890
01:14:48,363 --> 01:14:51,283
You know what I do? I connect.

891
01:14:51,992 --> 01:14:53,911
I get people off!

892
01:14:54,161 --> 01:14:57,080
I look for the one guy
who isn't getting off...

893
01:14:57,289 --> 01:14:59,625
...and I make him get off.

894
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:01,668
Actually, that you can print!

895
01:15:03,587 --> 01:15:07,591
And yet, why do I always end up
feeling like I'm a joke to you?

896
01:15:08,592 --> 01:15:12,387
You want to pretend this won't be
a very big band? Well, it is!

897
01:15:12,596 --> 01:15:14,807
You call yourself
a leader of this band...

898
01:15:15,349 --> 01:15:17,601
...but your direction
allowed this T-shirt...

899
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:22,523
...when you allowed Dick to manage us.
Because he's your friend!

900
01:15:22,731 --> 01:15:25,984
Don't you see, man?
The T-shirt is everything.

901
01:15:26,401 --> 01:15:30,739
Is it my turn now? I think we should,
for once, say what we really mean.

902
01:15:30,948 --> 01:15:34,618
- This is the part where you quit!
- Right, I'm so predictable.

903
01:15:34,827 --> 01:15:36,328
Deal with it.

904
01:15:36,537 --> 01:15:39,039
- I'll say what nobody else will say.
- What?!

905
01:15:39,248 --> 01:15:41,959
Your looks have become a problem!

906
01:15:42,501 --> 01:15:44,753
All right, okay, enough! Break it up.

907
01:15:44,962 --> 01:15:47,589
Everyone out of the room
for five minutes.

908
01:15:51,093 --> 01:15:52,136
Hey!

909
01:15:52,344 --> 01:15:54,263
Yeah. William. Sorry.

910
01:15:56,515 --> 01:15:58,517
Come on, man. Come on.

911
01:15:58,725 --> 01:16:01,770
Let's go find something real.

912
01:16:08,318 --> 01:16:11,071
From here on out, I'm only
interested in what is real.

913
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,990
Real people, real feelings.

914
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:16,034
That's all I'm interested in
from here on out.

915
01:16:17,703 --> 01:16:19,163
You're real.

916
01:16:20,664 --> 01:16:22,499
- Thanks.
- You know...

917
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:26,044
...you know all about us,
and I don't know shit about you.

918
01:16:28,714 --> 01:16:30,674
Tell me, what's your family like?

919
01:16:33,469 --> 01:16:35,429
My dad died of a heart attack.

920
01:16:35,637 --> 01:16:38,182
My sister believes
that my mom is so intense...

921
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:40,517
...that she had to escape our family.

922
01:16:40,726 --> 01:16:43,437
They can't find a way
to get through it.

923
01:16:43,645 --> 01:16:45,481
They don't even speak anymore.

924
01:16:45,689 --> 01:16:49,693
Plus, she gave me all her albums,
and now she's a stewardess.

925
01:16:53,697 --> 01:16:55,365
It's good to talk about.

926
01:16:56,575 --> 01:16:59,828
Really good.
But here I am telling secrets...

927
01:17:00,037 --> 01:17:03,415
...to the one guy you're not supposed
to tell your secrets to.

928
01:17:07,586 --> 01:17:09,379
You're Russell from Stillwater.

929
01:17:10,964 --> 01:17:14,551
Well, yeah, on my better days
I am Russell from Stillwater.

930
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,970
Want to go to my friend Aaron's party?

931
01:17:17,179 --> 01:17:19,014
I know you're
a big rock star and all...

932
01:17:19,306 --> 01:17:22,559
...but want to hang with good people
and have a good time?

933
01:17:23,811 --> 01:17:27,481
We're just real Topeka people, man.

934
01:17:49,419 --> 01:17:52,840
Oh, my God. Holy shit. Fuck!

935
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:55,300
I grew up with that lampshade.

936
01:17:56,051 --> 01:17:59,346
I love this kitchen.
I fucking love this kitchen!

937
01:18:07,062 --> 01:18:09,648
That's William over there.
Hey, William!

938
01:18:12,109 --> 01:18:16,196
You, Aaron, are what it's all about.

939
01:18:17,072 --> 01:18:18,532
You're real.

940
01:18:19,158 --> 01:18:20,659
Your room is real.

941
01:18:20,909 --> 01:18:23,245
Your friends are real.

942
01:18:23,453 --> 01:18:27,291
Real, man, real. You know? Real.

943
01:18:30,711 --> 01:18:32,504
Real, you know?

944
01:18:36,133 --> 01:18:41,263
You're more important
than all the silly machinery.

945
01:18:42,264 --> 01:18:44,266
Silly machinery. And you know it!

946
01:18:45,601 --> 01:18:49,229
In 11 years, it's gonna be 1984, man.
Think about that.

947
01:18:50,522 --> 01:18:52,649
Want to see me feed
a mouse to my snake?

948
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,109
Yes.

949
01:18:54,318 --> 01:18:56,570
Can I have that bitchin' belt?

950
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:58,447
Take it.

951
01:18:59,907 --> 01:19:03,744
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you, brother.

952
01:19:10,459 --> 01:19:13,086
We should probably get back
with the others.

953
01:19:13,337 --> 01:19:15,380
- Oh, it's over.
- Hey...

954
01:19:16,089 --> 01:19:19,551
...there's acid in the beer
that's in the red cups.

955
01:19:22,095 --> 01:19:23,514
That's mine.

956
01:19:25,682 --> 01:19:27,476
Topeka. Check it out.

957
01:19:27,684 --> 01:19:32,022
Please, don't give him
any more acid. Thank you.

958
01:19:40,697 --> 01:19:42,741
Dick? Dick, I got him.

959
01:19:43,534 --> 01:19:44,952
He's okay.

960
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:46,954
He is on acid, though.

961
01:19:47,496 --> 01:19:52,334
I can't really tell.
How do you know when it's kicked in?

962
01:19:52,835 --> 01:19:55,921
I am a golden god!

963
01:19:56,922 --> 01:19:58,173
Yes, you are!

964
01:19:59,258 --> 01:20:02,177
I am a golden god!

965
01:20:02,386 --> 01:20:03,428
Hey, Russell.

966
01:20:04,179 --> 01:20:05,305
Don't jump.

967
01:20:06,974 --> 01:20:09,393
And you can tell
Rolling Stone magazine...

968
01:20:09,893 --> 01:20:12,604
...that my last words...

969
01:20:13,355 --> 01:20:14,398
...were:

970
01:20:19,194 --> 01:20:20,487
"I'm on drugs."

971
01:20:30,664 --> 01:20:33,417
I think we should work
on those last words!

972
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:35,836
Oh, I got it, I got it, I got it.

973
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:39,548
I got it. I got it. This is better.

974
01:20:39,798 --> 01:20:41,800
Last words:

975
01:20:43,093 --> 01:20:44,928
"I dig music."

976
01:20:48,223 --> 01:20:49,683
"I'm on drugs!"

977
01:20:54,521 --> 01:20:55,814
Just come on down...

978
01:20:56,023 --> 01:20:58,692
...and we'll go back to the hotel.

979
01:20:59,109 --> 01:21:00,194
Okay.

980
01:21:00,402 --> 01:21:01,820
- Jump.
- Jump!

981
01:21:17,711 --> 01:21:19,129
Somebody help him.

982
01:21:19,338 --> 01:21:21,089
I'll save you, Russell!

983
01:21:27,513 --> 01:21:31,767
They've been crying for you
like a bunch of whimpering pussies.

984
01:21:31,975 --> 01:21:33,268
Oh, the band's over.

985
01:21:33,519 --> 01:21:36,188
- This is my family now.
- That's right.

986
01:21:36,396 --> 01:21:38,315
- Right.
- Definitely. It's over.

987
01:21:38,524 --> 01:21:41,819
- He's staying with us.
- Let's just go to Greenville.

988
01:21:42,027 --> 01:21:45,364
We'll listen to some great music,
we'll finish the tour...

989
01:21:45,572 --> 01:21:48,450
...and then we'll leave
those ungrateful fools behind.

990
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:51,286
Then we'll come back here,
where you'll live.

991
01:21:51,495 --> 01:21:54,331
- That sounds good.
- He can stay in our basement.

992
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:58,377
- I see what you're doing. I like it.
- Okay, good.

993
01:21:59,127 --> 01:22:00,295
Come on.

994
01:22:01,004 --> 01:22:03,632
I got it, man, I got it.

995
01:22:03,882 --> 01:22:05,926
That felt kind of good, though.

996
01:22:06,844 --> 01:22:08,720
Excuse me, kids.

997
01:22:09,304 --> 01:22:12,391
Look at him.
He's taking notes with his eyes.

998
01:22:12,599 --> 01:22:15,018
How do we know you're not a cop? Huh?

999
01:22:15,227 --> 01:22:18,480
The Enemy?
Stop fucking looking at me!

1000
01:22:18,689 --> 01:22:20,482
He's your guardian angel.

1001
01:22:20,691 --> 01:22:23,986
Don't worry.
He only means half of what he says.

1002
01:22:24,194 --> 01:22:25,320
Which half?

1003
01:22:25,529 --> 01:22:27,447
Just help me get my interview.

1004
01:22:27,656 --> 01:22:30,242
- I have to go home, Dick.
- Okay, okay.

1005
01:22:30,492 --> 01:22:32,286
- I have to go home.
- Look.

1006
01:22:32,494 --> 01:22:35,956
You saved the tour.
That's good enough for now, okay?

1007
01:22:36,832 --> 01:22:39,585
- Come on, big fella, let's go.
- I hurt the flower.

1008
01:22:39,793 --> 01:22:44,298
Did you, man? You hurt the flower?
That's nice. Come on, on the bus.

1009
01:22:50,012 --> 01:22:53,557
Ladies and gentlemen,
the evening is over!

1010
01:22:54,099 --> 01:22:59,521
We hope you all enjoyed yourselves,
and we'll see you all again in 1974.

1011
01:22:59,771 --> 01:23:01,398
Good evening!

1012
01:24:51,758 --> 01:24:53,594
I have to go home.

1013
01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:00,058
You are home.

1014
01:25:15,324 --> 01:25:17,367
In Carl Jung's opinion...

1015
01:25:17,576 --> 01:25:20,496
...we all have
a sixth sense, intuition.

1016
01:25:20,704 --> 01:25:23,707
When you feel you can't live
without someone you just met...

1017
01:25:23,916 --> 01:25:28,212
...this could be the memory of a past
love from the collective unconscious.

1018
01:25:30,088 --> 01:25:31,965
Or it could just be hormones.

1019
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:36,970
I'm sorry, I can't concentrate.

1020
01:25:38,096 --> 01:25:41,183
Rock stars have kidnapped my son.

1021
01:25:49,358 --> 01:25:52,611
Most of the fuckups in the world...

1022
01:25:52,861 --> 01:25:55,948
... come from the brain,
not the instincts.

1023
01:25:56,532 --> 01:25:58,951
My whole thing is to try and...

1024
01:25:59,201 --> 01:26:02,037
My thing is to make
my brain go away.

1025
01:26:02,287 --> 01:26:04,998
But I can't, except on stage.

1026
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:09,419
The brain should be a softening
influence on the instincts...

1027
01:26:09,628 --> 01:26:12,631
...but the instincts should drive.

1028
01:26:12,881 --> 01:26:17,719
Trying to reconcile the brain
with ancient urges.

1029
01:26:17,970 --> 01:26:21,014
The way the brain interprets
these instincts...

1030
01:26:21,265 --> 01:26:22,724
...is a heavy trip.

1031
01:26:22,933 --> 01:26:26,395
Vallencourt, are you getting
on the bus or what?

1032
01:26:28,397 --> 01:26:31,608
Come on, let's get on the bus.

1033
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:38,782
U sually I'm brain...

1034
01:26:39,283 --> 01:26:41,827
... and Russell is instinct.

1035
01:26:43,912 --> 01:26:46,623
But when we're both instinct...

1036
01:26:46,874 --> 01:26:50,752
... that's when we make
the most memorable music...

1037
01:26:51,003 --> 01:26:52,754
... because it's the best.

1038
01:26:57,509 --> 01:27:01,221
Show me any guy who said
he didn't want popularity...

1039
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:06,268
...and I'll show you a scared guy.
I've studied the history of music.

1040
01:27:06,477 --> 01:27:09,980
Most of the time, the best stuff
is the popular stuff.

1041
01:27:10,564 --> 01:27:13,525
It's safe to say popularity sucks.

1042
01:27:13,775 --> 01:27:17,571
It allows you to forgive yourself
if you suck.

1043
01:27:17,863 --> 01:27:21,450
And I don't forgive myself.
Do you?

1044
01:27:24,036 --> 01:27:26,413
Lester, Rolling Stone
is calling me.

1045
01:27:26,622 --> 01:27:28,373
I don't have my key interview.

1046
01:27:30,042 --> 01:27:32,294
- Days are going by.
- You're flipping.

1047
01:27:32,503 --> 01:27:34,838
That's good. All right.

1048
01:27:35,714 --> 01:27:38,550
This is how you blow their minds.
He'll ask you...

1049
01:27:38,759 --> 01:27:41,261
- This is Ben Fong-Torres, right?
- Yeah.

1050
01:27:41,470 --> 01:27:45,057
He'll ask you how the story's going,
and this is what you do.

1051
01:27:45,349 --> 01:27:46,725
Tell him...

1052
01:27:47,976 --> 01:27:50,896
...you know, it's a...
It's a "think piece"...

1053
01:27:51,522 --> 01:27:53,607
Think piece.

1054
01:27:54,233 --> 01:27:56,652
... about a mid-level band...

1055
01:27:56,860 --> 01:28:00,781
...struggling with their own
limitations in the, you know...

1056
01:28:00,989 --> 01:28:02,282
...harsh face of stardom.

1057
01:28:02,491 --> 01:28:04,827
Harsh face.

1058
01:28:05,035 --> 01:28:07,162
Yeah, he'll wet himself.

1059
01:28:12,543 --> 01:28:15,504
All dressed up and no place to go.

1060
01:28:15,712 --> 01:28:16,922
Greenville.

1061
01:28:17,131 --> 01:28:18,799
I'm bored.

1062
01:28:24,888 --> 01:28:27,766
Who hid the Quaaludes from me?

1063
01:28:28,725 --> 01:28:30,018
I have to pee.

1064
01:28:30,936 --> 01:28:33,188
Wow! Cute.

1065
01:28:35,357 --> 01:28:37,568
Let's deflower the kid.

1066
01:28:45,993 --> 01:28:48,829
Whoa. Hold on, hold on.

1067
01:28:49,037 --> 01:28:51,123
Wait. I should leave.

1068
01:28:51,331 --> 01:28:53,876
I think things are going
backwards for me.

1069
01:28:54,084 --> 01:28:56,670
- Backwards?
- Well, I don't know. I just...

1070
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:01,383
I thought maybe we could hang out.
You know, do some stuff back home...

1071
01:29:01,592 --> 01:29:03,218
...like regular stuff.

1072
01:29:03,427 --> 01:29:07,431
Get to know each other a little
bit better, and then I'd see you pee.

1073
01:29:07,639 --> 01:29:11,226
I mean, you know, that's just
the way I usually do it.

1074
01:29:11,435 --> 01:29:13,353
You're one of us.

1075
01:29:13,729 --> 01:29:15,189
If you come to Cleveland...

1076
01:29:15,439 --> 01:29:18,025
...Bowie will be at Swingo's,
America's greatest hotel.

1077
01:29:18,233 --> 01:29:22,112
I'll introduce you to him,
and his security guard, Dennis.

1078
01:29:22,321 --> 01:29:24,948
Don't you have any regular friends?

1079
01:29:25,449 --> 01:29:28,118
Famous people are
just more interesting.

1080
01:29:29,203 --> 01:29:32,206
Well, I would be worried
that they were using me.

1081
01:29:34,082 --> 01:29:36,585
Boy, if this was the real world...

1082
01:29:36,793 --> 01:29:38,754
Not that anybody's using you!

1083
01:29:38,962 --> 01:29:40,422
No. Hold on.

1084
01:29:43,175 --> 01:29:45,803
I'm not famous. But...

1085
01:29:46,929 --> 01:29:49,681
- Your time has come.
- Did Russell call?

1086
01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:51,975
- Deflower.
- Opie must die.

1087
01:29:53,811 --> 01:29:56,647
- Pants him, girls.
- Stop. We're talking.

1088
01:29:56,855 --> 01:29:58,482
Opie must die.

1089
01:29:59,233 --> 01:30:03,195
- No. Okay, this isn't funny.
- No, come on!

1090
01:30:05,864 --> 01:30:07,366
- Up!
- Please.

1091
01:30:08,325 --> 01:30:10,619
Guys, come on. I have to write.

1092
01:30:36,895 --> 01:30:39,231
Come on, Penny, join us.

1093
01:30:57,791 --> 01:31:01,378
Take a vacation from yourself.
Leave this up to professionals.

1094
01:31:01,587 --> 01:31:03,005
Don't worry, William.

1095
01:31:03,213 --> 01:31:07,759
I've seen the future, and this
all works out reasonably well.

1096
01:31:08,343 --> 01:31:09,970
Reasonably?

1097
01:31:16,059 --> 01:31:17,769
Hello?

1098
01:31:18,687 --> 01:31:22,608
Hello. This is Ben Fong-Torres
calling from Rolling Stone.

1099
01:31:22,858 --> 01:31:25,277
Hi, Ben Fong-Torres
from Rolling Stone.

1100
01:31:25,527 --> 01:31:27,905
Hello, hello.

1101
01:31:29,948 --> 01:31:30,991
Hello, Ben.

1102
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:36,288
William Miller, this is your editor
at Rolling Stone. How's the story?

1103
01:31:36,955 --> 01:31:38,916
I'm getting good stuff out here.

1104
01:31:39,124 --> 01:31:41,084
Yeah, it sounds like it.

1105
01:31:42,294 --> 01:31:43,545
Man, I need some...

1106
01:31:47,382 --> 01:31:50,427
Now, listen. Get it together, man.

1107
01:31:50,636 --> 01:31:53,555
We're professionals.
I don't need to tell you this.

1108
01:31:53,764 --> 01:31:57,142
You're not there to party.
We already have Hunter Thompson.

1109
01:31:57,351 --> 01:31:59,978
You're out there
to interview and to report.

1110
01:32:00,187 --> 01:32:02,898
Now, this isn't Creem.
This is Rolling Stone.

1111
01:32:03,106 --> 01:32:06,360
This story is due in four days.
How is it shaping up?

1112
01:32:11,323 --> 01:32:13,951
It's a think-piece
about a mid-level band...

1113
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:18,247
...struggling with their limitations
in the harsh face of stardom.

1114
01:32:18,664 --> 01:32:19,706
That's great.

1115
01:32:22,167 --> 01:32:26,672
I like what we're saying. Let me try
and get you 1000 more words.

1116
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:29,383
Now, it's in consideration
for the cover...

1117
01:32:29,591 --> 01:32:32,010
... but don't tell the band.

1118
01:32:33,053 --> 01:32:34,972
The cover.

1119
01:32:35,222 --> 01:32:36,765
Crazy.

1120
01:32:36,974 --> 01:32:38,475
Crazy.

1121
01:32:39,476 --> 01:32:40,769
Some coffee.

1122
01:32:40,978 --> 01:32:42,437
Me too.

1123
01:32:42,938 --> 01:32:45,023
Greenville is so boring.

1124
01:32:45,232 --> 01:32:49,820
You know, any other city in the world,
and you'd still be a virgin.

1125
01:32:50,445 --> 01:32:53,323
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- What?

1126
01:32:53,532 --> 01:32:57,411
I've never written anything more
than a few pages in my whole life.

1127
01:32:57,619 --> 01:33:01,039
- Don't worry, baby, you will.
- I gotta find Russell.

1128
01:33:01,248 --> 01:33:04,668
- I gotta find Russell.
- Oh, will you take the laundry?

1129
01:33:06,295 --> 01:33:07,504
Take the laundry?

1130
01:33:08,839 --> 01:33:11,550
What am I to you? Huh? Tell me.

1131
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:13,343
Tell me right now.

1132
01:33:13,552 --> 01:33:16,430
What am I to you?

1133
01:33:26,690 --> 01:33:28,567
Excuse me, sir,
will you sign for this?

1134
01:33:28,817 --> 01:33:31,153
Good morning.

1135
01:33:45,417 --> 01:33:47,503
Please go the fuck away!

1136
01:34:42,599 --> 01:34:45,644
We'll do the interview in Cleveland.

1137
01:34:46,478 --> 01:34:49,439
No, I can't go to Cleveland.

1138
01:34:49,690 --> 01:34:53,152
Come on, man, we'll have
more time there.

1139
01:34:53,527 --> 01:34:54,778
Don't be tense.

1140
01:34:57,531 --> 01:34:58,907
Come to Cleveland.

1141
01:34:59,158 --> 01:35:00,868
- Come to Cleveland.
- Come to Cleveland.

1142
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:05,873
- Come to Cleveland.
- I can't go to Cleveland.

1143
01:35:06,123 --> 01:35:08,876
Can we help it if we like
having you around?

1144
01:35:09,126 --> 01:35:11,336
Come to Cleveland.

1145
01:35:12,713 --> 01:35:15,674
I don't want to go to Cleveland, okay?

1146
01:35:15,966 --> 01:35:19,011
I want to go home.

1147
01:35:20,554 --> 01:35:22,890
I like it when you yell.

1148
01:35:23,098 --> 01:35:27,978
I'm not gonna let you miss out
on the rock mecca of the Midwest.

1149
01:35:28,228 --> 01:35:29,688
You're with us.

1150
01:35:30,189 --> 01:35:34,902
- Rock'n'roll.
- Rock'n'roll.

1151
01:35:36,361 --> 01:35:40,407
I know, I know.
"It's all happening."

1152
01:35:54,755 --> 01:35:56,757
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hi.

1153
01:35:58,926 --> 01:36:00,761
- It's Stillwater!
- Oh, my God!

1154
01:36:00,969 --> 01:36:03,722
Hi, welcome to Swingo's.
You must be Stillwater.

1155
01:36:03,931 --> 01:36:08,227
"Memory of a Free Festival,"
that's vintage Bowie.

1156
01:36:08,477 --> 01:36:13,899
Ziggy Stardust is mass media.
It's hamburgers for the apocalypse.

1157
01:36:16,819 --> 01:36:18,195
It's Bowie!

1158
01:36:52,563 --> 01:36:55,983
Jeff and Russell are
the band's figureheads...

1159
01:36:56,191 --> 01:36:59,403
...but the true Stillwater fan...

1160
01:36:59,653 --> 01:37:05,075
...knows that the purity, the core of
Stillwater, comes from Ed Vallencourt.

1161
01:37:05,659 --> 01:37:09,121
Hi, Mom. I'm gonna
fly back Monday morning.

1162
01:37:10,455 --> 01:37:13,876
No, I'll only miss one test.
I'll make graduation.

1163
01:37:14,084 --> 01:37:16,795
Tell her you're a slave
to the groove.

1164
01:37:22,843 --> 01:37:26,346
Hey, Mom, it's Russell Hammond.
I play guitar in Stillwater.

1165
01:37:26,555 --> 01:37:31,101
How does it feel to be the mother
of the best rock journalist we've met?

1166
01:37:33,395 --> 01:37:34,646
Hello?

1167
01:37:37,774 --> 01:37:40,319
You got a great kid here.
Don't worry.

1168
01:37:40,569 --> 01:37:44,281
We're taking good care of him.
You should come to the show...

1169
01:37:44,531 --> 01:37:46,825
...and join the circus.
- Listen, mister.

1170
01:37:47,451 --> 01:37:49,995
Your charm doesn't work on me.
I'm onto you.

1171
01:37:50,204 --> 01:37:52,080
Oh, of course you like him.

1172
01:37:52,831 --> 01:37:54,249
Well, yeah.

1173
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:59,171
He worships you people. That's fine
as long as he helps make you rich.

1174
01:37:59,755 --> 01:38:03,467
- Rich? I don't think so. We sit...
- Listen to me.

1175
01:38:03,675 --> 01:38:06,762
He's a smart, goodhearted
15-year-old kid...

1176
01:38:06,970 --> 01:38:08,347
... with infinite potential.

1177
01:38:09,932 --> 01:38:12,518
You're not talking
to some apron-wearing mom.

1178
01:38:12,726 --> 01:38:15,771
I know about your decadence.
I shouldn't have let him go.

1179
01:38:16,313 --> 01:38:21,235
He's not ready for your world of
compromise and diminished brain cells.

1180
01:38:21,443 --> 01:38:22,611
Am I clear?

1181
01:38:23,111 --> 01:38:25,280
- Yes, ma'am.
- lf you break his spirit...

1182
01:38:25,489 --> 01:38:27,074
... harm him in any way...

1183
01:38:27,282 --> 01:38:31,119
...keep him from his chosen profession,
which is law, something I value...

1184
01:38:32,079 --> 01:38:34,081
... you'll meet this voice in person...

1185
01:38:34,289 --> 01:38:37,835
...and it will not be pretty.
Do we understand each other?

1186
01:38:38,544 --> 01:38:40,879
- Yes, ma'am.
- I didn't ask for this role...

1187
01:38:41,088 --> 01:38:42,631
...but I'll play it.

1188
01:38:44,466 --> 01:38:46,343
Now go do your best.

1189
01:38:46,802 --> 01:38:49,763
"Be bold, and mighty forces
will come to your aid."

1190
01:38:49,972 --> 01:38:51,598
Goethe said that.

1191
01:38:53,517 --> 01:38:57,104
It's not too late for you
to become a person of substance.

1192
01:38:57,521 --> 01:39:00,357
Please get my son home safely.

1193
01:39:01,191 --> 01:39:03,485
You know, I'm glad we spoke.

1194
01:39:23,297 --> 01:39:25,215
- All right, boys.
- All right.

1195
01:39:29,386 --> 01:39:31,889
Your mom kind of freaked me out.

1196
01:39:33,515 --> 01:39:35,225
She means well.

1197
01:39:39,062 --> 01:39:42,733
From Troy, Michigan...

1198
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:47,321
... would you please
welcome to Cleveland...

1199
01:39:48,447 --> 01:39:50,574
...Stillwater!

1200
01:41:23,834 --> 01:41:26,795
When you play a great show
like tonight...

1201
01:41:27,004 --> 01:41:29,298
I need everyone's attention, please.

1202
01:41:29,506 --> 01:41:32,551
Girls, I need five minutes
with the band alone.

1203
01:41:32,801 --> 01:41:36,722
Right. Well, it seems
the rumours are true.

1204
01:41:37,639 --> 01:41:40,559
The record company's sent
a big-time manager here...

1205
01:41:40,767 --> 01:41:43,437
...to try and talk you
into replacing me.

1206
01:41:43,645 --> 01:41:46,064
It's Dennis Hope.
You've all heard of him.

1207
01:41:46,273 --> 01:41:49,860
He has all the big bands,
and he wants five minutes with you.

1208
01:41:51,195 --> 01:41:53,363
Well, I think we've gotta do this.

1209
01:41:55,741 --> 01:41:57,159
- Send him in.
- Bring him in.

1210
01:41:57,367 --> 01:42:00,579
- We'll send him out on a rail!
- All right.

1211
01:42:00,829 --> 01:42:05,000
We'll do the interview in Maryland.
You can fly home from there.

1212
01:42:09,463 --> 01:42:12,174
We got a manager
who's been with us all along.

1213
01:42:12,382 --> 01:42:14,510
Respectfully. We all have our roots.

1214
01:42:14,718 --> 01:42:16,804
Bands should hold on to their roots.

1215
01:42:17,137 --> 01:42:19,807
Those roots need to be augmented.

1216
01:42:20,015 --> 01:42:22,976
I'll tell you the truth.
I may enrage some...

1217
01:42:23,811 --> 01:42:27,356
...and enthral others.
I don't give a fuck.

1218
01:42:27,564 --> 01:42:30,734
Your manager here
needs a manager.

1219
01:42:30,943 --> 01:42:34,071
Example: If you hadn't
run out in Phoenix...

1220
01:42:34,279 --> 01:42:36,657
...we could have sued
over Russell's hand.

1221
01:42:36,865 --> 01:42:40,410
But you left, negating the contract,
forfeiting the deposit.

1222
01:42:40,619 --> 01:42:45,332
You travelled a long way to pay
that promoter to electrocute you.

1223
01:42:45,541 --> 01:42:47,918
Your damages have put you in the hole.

1224
01:42:48,127 --> 01:42:50,754
You owe the record company
more than you got.

1225
01:42:51,046 --> 01:42:53,006
But there's money to be made.

1226
01:42:53,215 --> 01:42:56,468
I brought a plane.
More shows to make up the difference.

1227
01:42:56,677 --> 01:42:59,221
- Respectfully.
- We travel by bus.

1228
01:42:59,471 --> 01:43:02,099
Doris is the soul of this band.

1229
01:43:02,307 --> 01:43:05,853
That bus has been our home
since we were the Jeff Bebe band.

1230
01:43:06,061 --> 01:43:09,148
I'd travel on a pogo stick
to make more money.

1231
01:43:09,356 --> 01:43:10,941
You could play more dates.

1232
01:43:11,150 --> 01:43:14,987
It's not about money. It's about
the music and turning people on.

1233
01:43:15,195 --> 01:43:16,572
Clearly. Respectfully.

1234
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:19,449
But on the distasteful
subject of money...

1235
01:43:19,658 --> 01:43:23,871
...just know that you're all
making it, right now...

1236
01:43:24,288 --> 01:43:26,165
...and it's all out there.

1237
01:43:26,415 --> 01:43:30,043
I'm just talking about
bringing it back here.

1238
01:43:31,086 --> 01:43:33,797
Why pay for something we can do?

1239
01:43:34,006 --> 01:43:38,260
You know how not to get charged
for the ice below Chicago Stadium?

1240
01:43:39,178 --> 01:43:40,929
You know how to do a headlining tour?

1241
01:43:41,180 --> 01:43:46,393
Do you know Claire Rothman in L.A?
Know Bobby Cowan, Danny Marcus...

1242
01:43:46,602 --> 01:43:48,479
...Lisa Robinson?

1243
01:43:48,729 --> 01:43:50,564
Know Frank Barcelona?

1244
01:43:51,190 --> 01:43:54,568
This is Cleveland!
Where's Kid Leo? Where is he?

1245
01:43:54,776 --> 01:43:57,863
You know how to get a record
not pressed, but played?

1246
01:43:58,113 --> 01:44:02,576
I didn't invent the rainy day, man.
I just own the best umbrella.

1247
01:44:02,784 --> 01:44:06,622
You may believe this will
last forever. It does not.

1248
01:44:06,872 --> 01:44:10,667
Your biggest fan right now...
Your biggest fan...

1249
01:44:10,876 --> 01:44:16,298
...is gonna go to college, buy
clothes, spend that money elsewhere.

1250
01:44:17,591 --> 01:44:22,387
And you know what? They'll tape
your record from a friend.

1251
01:44:22,679 --> 01:44:26,391
You gotta take what you can,
when you can, while you can...

1252
01:44:26,642 --> 01:44:28,393
...and you gotta do it now.

1253
01:44:28,602 --> 01:44:30,187
That's what the big boys do.

1254
01:44:30,395 --> 01:44:32,564
If you think Mick Jagger'll
still be there...

1255
01:44:32,815 --> 01:44:37,236
...trying to be a rock star at age 50,
you're sadly mistaken.

1256
01:44:38,362 --> 01:44:40,989
Well, thank you, Dennis.

1257
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:45,285
- We'll think about what you said.
- Oh, no...

1258
01:44:46,286 --> 01:44:50,290
...l'll think about it.
I'm not auditioning.

1259
01:44:50,499 --> 01:44:54,336
I came here to decide
if I want to represent you.

1260
01:44:54,545 --> 01:44:59,967
So I'll stand outside and think
about whether I wanna stay.

1261
01:45:01,635 --> 01:45:03,387
It was a good show.

1262
01:45:15,149 --> 01:45:17,609
I miss him already.

1263
01:45:18,652 --> 01:45:22,656
You're coming along at a very
dangerous time for rock'n'roll.

1264
01:45:22,865 --> 01:45:25,033
The war is over. They won.

1265
01:45:25,284 --> 01:45:27,244
They will ruin rock'n'roll...

1266
01:45:27,452 --> 01:45:31,165
... and strangle everything
we love about it.

1267
01:46:51,286 --> 01:46:54,206
- Put them up.
- I don't know what that was.

1268
01:46:54,414 --> 01:46:56,708
Donkey dick, man!

1269
01:46:56,959 --> 01:46:59,920
A donkey dick is funny everywhere.

1270
01:47:02,256 --> 01:47:03,590
Is Russell here?

1271
01:47:03,841 --> 01:47:06,969
Hey, the Enemy! Come on in, son.

1272
01:47:09,471 --> 01:47:12,015
Welcome to the road manager
poker party.

1273
01:47:12,266 --> 01:47:16,145
This game's been going on for
two years. Come on, find a spot.

1274
01:47:16,854 --> 01:47:18,939
- Mick's with The Who.
- How you doing?

1275
01:47:19,148 --> 01:47:22,484
Raymond's with the Eagles.
Reg is with Humble Pie.

1276
01:47:22,693 --> 01:47:24,903
- I think you know Red Dog.
- Hey, brother!

1277
01:47:25,112 --> 01:47:27,614
We developed this system
of poker over time...

1278
01:47:27,823 --> 01:47:30,701
...to play in any condition,
which helps.

1279
01:47:30,951 --> 01:47:33,704
We let Russell in because
he brought hash.

1280
01:47:33,912 --> 01:47:37,749
- The press is here.
- Don't mention me, or The Eagles.

1281
01:47:38,834 --> 01:47:41,128
- I'm done.
- I'm out.

1282
01:47:42,379 --> 01:47:44,256
- I'm in.
- All right.

1283
01:47:44,465 --> 01:47:49,678
Side proposition to the winner:
For 50 bucks and a case of Heineken...

1284
01:47:49,887 --> 01:47:51,805
...l'll throw in three ladies...

1285
01:47:52,055 --> 01:47:54,933
...including Miss Penny Lane
and the famous Band Aids...

1286
01:47:55,142 --> 01:47:58,896
...who have to leave the tour
before New York.

1287
01:47:59,980 --> 01:48:02,608
- Okay with you?
- Russ is getting soft.

1288
01:48:04,776 --> 01:48:07,529
- Is that okay?
- Okay.

1289
01:48:07,779 --> 01:48:09,156
It's a deal.

1290
01:48:09,448 --> 01:48:10,824
Show them.

1291
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:14,495
Three lovely ladies
in the custody of Humble Pie.

1292
01:48:14,786 --> 01:48:19,041
- Be good to them, Reg.
- We owe you $50 and a case of Heineken.

1293
01:48:19,249 --> 01:48:20,375
All right.

1294
01:48:21,084 --> 01:48:23,837
- Joint?
- Know how I know this is good stuff?

1295
01:48:24,046 --> 01:48:25,339
- How?
- It's from Crosby.

1296
01:48:25,547 --> 01:48:28,008
- Is that the Crosby weed?
- It's from Crosby.

1297
01:48:28,217 --> 01:48:31,261
- Oh, I'm in.
- I'm in.

1298
01:48:33,305 --> 01:48:35,057
Give me a light. I want fire.

1299
01:48:35,265 --> 01:48:38,644
Look, nobody's feelings
are getting hurt here.

1300
01:48:38,852 --> 01:48:42,940
She knows Leslie's coming to New York
tomorrow. Everyone understands.

1301
01:48:43,315 --> 01:48:46,276
It's the circus.
Everyone's trying not to go home.

1302
01:48:46,693 --> 01:48:48,779
Nobody's saying goodbye.

1303
01:48:51,365 --> 01:48:54,535
Quit looking at me like that.

1304
01:49:31,530 --> 01:49:33,282
I'm making a wish.

1305
01:49:42,124 --> 01:49:43,709
So...

1306
01:49:44,626 --> 01:49:47,671
Penny, our friend
Has gained another year

1307
01:49:47,921 --> 01:49:50,591
But long ago she threw it in gear

1308
01:49:50,841 --> 01:49:55,471
She rocked the south
The east, the west

1309
01:49:56,180 --> 01:49:57,890
Could we get off this tour

1310
01:49:58,140 --> 01:50:00,726
As Black Sabbath's special guests

1311
01:50:02,978 --> 01:50:07,566
She says she's retired
But we've heard that before

1312
01:50:07,774 --> 01:50:12,529
She chose us
In Penny Lane we trust

1313
01:50:12,779 --> 01:50:16,241
She is a fan of this band

1314
01:50:17,367 --> 01:50:19,578
Much more so than us

1315
01:50:47,397 --> 01:50:49,191
Thank you, baby.

1316
01:50:55,656 --> 01:50:58,075
Who wants the "P" in Penny?

1317
01:50:58,450 --> 01:51:00,744
Happy birthday.

1318
01:51:00,994 --> 01:51:03,997
- Thank you.
- Sorry the plane isn't bigger.

1319
01:51:06,667 --> 01:51:08,544
I'll take a piece.

1320
01:51:35,362 --> 01:51:37,573
Who didn't get cake?

1321
01:51:47,666 --> 01:51:50,085
Any extra plates?

1322
01:51:51,253 --> 01:51:52,546
Anybody?

1323
01:51:55,174 --> 01:51:57,217
You think you can fool me.

1324
01:51:57,593 --> 01:52:00,679
I can read you.
I know what you're thinking.

1325
01:52:01,638 --> 01:52:05,726
- What's that?
- You're worried about me and Russell.

1326
01:52:08,729 --> 01:52:11,148
Yeah, I gotta work on that.

1327
01:52:11,648 --> 01:52:13,442
You're so sweet.

1328
01:52:14,067 --> 01:52:17,821
God, if there was more of you in him.

1329
01:52:18,030 --> 01:52:21,825
Don't tell me this stuff.
I want to like him.

1330
01:52:24,953 --> 01:52:26,997
Did you miss a test or something?

1331
01:52:28,415 --> 01:52:32,419
- You have no idea.
- I know I'm not on the plane.

1332
01:52:32,628 --> 01:52:34,338
I won't go with another band.

1333
01:52:34,546 --> 01:52:37,382
I could go with the crew,
but that'd be pathetic...

1334
01:52:37,591 --> 01:52:40,135
...and the girls are all
going with Humble Pie.

1335
01:52:40,552 --> 01:52:44,097
So if you could find out
from Russell...

1336
01:52:44,598 --> 01:52:47,976
Forget it, I'll fly myself.
I have lots of partial tickets.

1337
01:52:48,185 --> 01:52:51,063
I know his ex-wife-
current-girlfriend thing will be...

1338
01:52:51,271 --> 01:52:52,898
That's not a good idea.

1339
01:52:53,106 --> 01:52:56,735
What are you saying?
Did Russell say something?

1340
01:52:58,237 --> 01:53:01,323
- I don't know anything.
- I know he wants me there.

1341
01:53:01,782 --> 01:53:03,617
Wake up!

1342
01:53:03,909 --> 01:53:05,327
Don't go to New York.

1343
01:53:06,245 --> 01:53:09,456
- Why are you yelling?
- I thought we were going to Morocco.

1344
01:53:09,665 --> 01:53:12,668
There is no Morocco.
There's never been a Morocco.

1345
01:53:12,876 --> 01:53:15,212
There's not even a Penny Lane.

1346
01:53:15,546 --> 01:53:17,881
I don't even know your real name.

1347
01:53:18,632 --> 01:53:22,344
If I met a man in the real world
who looked at me the way you...

1348
01:53:22,553 --> 01:53:26,306
When and where
does this "real world" occur?

1349
01:53:26,515 --> 01:53:30,519
I mean, I am really confused here.
All these rules...

1350
01:53:30,727 --> 01:53:32,855
...and all these sayings
and nicknames.

1351
01:53:33,063 --> 01:53:37,192
Honey, you're too sweet
for rock'n'roll.

1352
01:53:37,651 --> 01:53:39,278
Sweet?

1353
01:53:39,945 --> 01:53:41,738
Where do you get off?

1354
01:53:41,947 --> 01:53:43,532
Where do you get "sweet"?

1355
01:53:43,740 --> 01:53:46,326
I am dark and mysterious
and pissed off!

1356
01:53:46,535 --> 01:53:49,204
And I could be very dangerous
to all of you.

1357
01:53:49,413 --> 01:53:51,415
I am not sweet.

1358
01:53:51,623 --> 01:53:55,752
And you should know that about me.
I am the Enemy!

1359
01:53:55,961 --> 01:53:57,838
You should be happy for me.

1360
01:53:58,046 --> 01:54:00,716
You don't know
what he says to me in private.

1361
01:54:00,924 --> 01:54:04,052
Maybe it is love,
as much as it can be for somebody...

1362
01:54:04,261 --> 01:54:07,890
Who sold you to Humble Pie
for 50 bucks and a case of beer?

1363
01:54:08,932 --> 01:54:10,559
I was there.

1364
01:54:11,351 --> 01:54:13,270
I was there!

1365
01:54:20,027 --> 01:54:21,195
Oh, God.

1366
01:54:26,492 --> 01:54:28,368
I'm sorry.

1367
01:54:41,381 --> 01:54:43,509
What kind of beer?

1368
01:55:00,734 --> 01:55:03,070
Welcome to New York!
You can be nervous.

1369
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:08,450
You should be. Just be yourself and
leave a pint of blood on the stage.

1370
01:55:08,659 --> 01:55:09,868
Hey, William.

1371
01:55:10,077 --> 01:55:13,247
We showed you America.
We did everything but get you laid.

1372
01:55:26,510 --> 01:55:27,928
No. Yeah?

1373
01:55:47,281 --> 01:55:50,951
I'm from the Church of Lenny.
We bow to his will.

1374
01:55:51,201 --> 01:55:53,704
He is the king of kings.

1375
01:55:53,954 --> 01:55:56,915
- Can I get an autograph?
- Made out to who?

1376
01:55:57,124 --> 01:55:59,084
- She's here.
- To Lenny.

1377
01:56:03,505 --> 01:56:05,716
- Can I have your autograph?
- Yeah.

1378
01:56:06,842 --> 01:56:07,885
Leslie!

1379
01:56:11,138 --> 01:56:13,724
Room's fully stocked.
Air conditioning's on.

1380
01:56:13,974 --> 01:56:16,310
- You look stunning.
- Thanks. See you later.

1381
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:18,520
All right, bags in five!

1382
01:56:18,896 --> 01:56:21,106
Cars leave for the party at 6.

1383
01:56:21,565 --> 01:56:23,275
Oh, God.

1384
01:56:27,321 --> 01:56:30,407
There are lighter souvenirs,
you know.

1385
01:56:30,657 --> 01:56:34,578
I kept thinking I was gonna
go home the next day.

1386
01:56:34,828 --> 01:56:37,372
So did I, 15 years ago.

1387
01:56:37,998 --> 01:56:40,584
That's the wrong bag, you idiot!

1388
01:56:40,793 --> 01:56:42,044
William?

1389
01:56:42,377 --> 01:56:43,420
Vic!

1390
01:56:43,629 --> 01:56:46,673
It's all happening.
They're here.

1391
01:56:46,882 --> 01:56:50,677
Zeppelin are here. They are here.
They're at the Plaza.

1392
01:56:50,928 --> 01:56:55,599
Sapphire and Miss Penny Lane
are there too.

1393
01:56:55,849 --> 01:56:59,478
They're all staying under the name
"Emily Rugburn."

1394
01:56:59,978 --> 01:57:03,065
- Wait. Penny Lane is here?
- Emily Rugburn.

1395
01:57:03,732 --> 01:57:04,775
William Miller?

1396
01:57:05,234 --> 01:57:07,194
Sir, you have an urgent call.

1397
01:57:09,321 --> 01:57:10,364
Hello?

1398
01:57:10,572 --> 01:57:13,408
This is Jann Wenner,
publisher of Rolling Stone.

1399
01:57:13,659 --> 01:57:15,410
Congratulations, it's a cover.

1400
01:57:16,245 --> 01:57:18,122
Leibovitz will shoot them in L.A...

1401
01:57:18,372 --> 01:57:20,290
...but we need you
in San Francisco...

1402
01:57:20,541 --> 01:57:24,044
... tomorrow. You can finish
the story here. Talk to Ben.

1403
01:57:24,711 --> 01:57:28,006
You can tell the band. Alison, our
fact-checker, needs you...

1404
01:57:28,257 --> 01:57:31,426
... to transmit whatever you have
of the story tonight.

1405
01:57:31,718 --> 01:57:34,096
There's a mojo at the Daily News
you can use.

1406
01:57:34,429 --> 01:57:35,472
A mojo?

1407
01:57:35,722 --> 01:57:40,477
A mojo. It's a modern machine that
transmits pages over the telephone.

1408
01:57:40,727 --> 01:57:43,272
It only takes 18 minutes a page.

1409
01:57:44,731 --> 01:57:47,526
As soon as people leave,
I'll fit you in.

1410
01:57:47,734 --> 01:57:50,863
- Excuse me. Got an I. D?
- No.

1411
01:57:51,530 --> 01:57:53,157
Hey, man, he's cool.

1412
01:57:53,365 --> 01:57:56,201
- Dennis, how's it going?
- Great.

1413
01:57:56,452 --> 01:57:58,120
Well, enjoy.

1414
01:58:14,303 --> 01:58:15,888
Opie.

1415
01:58:16,305 --> 01:58:19,933
I'm going to England with Deep Purple
in an hour.

1416
01:58:22,769 --> 01:58:24,855
Don't forget me, okay?

1417
01:58:27,441 --> 01:58:31,069
It's all happening.
I must vamoosh.

1418
01:58:51,423 --> 01:58:52,883
Hey, the Enemy.

1419
01:58:53,133 --> 01:58:57,387
We got a table back there.
They're all looking for you.

1420
01:59:01,433 --> 01:59:02,476
Guys.

1421
01:59:04,269 --> 01:59:05,813
Guys!

1422
01:59:08,899 --> 01:59:11,860
You're gonna be on the cover
of Rolling Stone.

1423
01:59:14,822 --> 01:59:16,573
Are you serious?

1424
01:59:17,074 --> 01:59:19,785
The cover of Rolling Stone.

1425
01:59:20,786 --> 01:59:22,538
And we made it together.

1426
01:59:24,123 --> 01:59:26,375
And they don't just put somebody...

1427
01:59:26,625 --> 01:59:30,587
...with one little hit on
the cover of Rolling Stone...

1428
01:59:30,963 --> 01:59:33,590
...fucking magazine, man!

1429
01:59:33,841 --> 01:59:36,093
Damn it, I'm gonna enjoy this.

1430
01:59:36,301 --> 01:59:38,762
When I first bought the magazine...

1431
01:59:39,012 --> 01:59:41,431
...The Beatles were on the cover.

1432
01:59:41,682 --> 01:59:42,724
The Beatles.

1433
01:59:42,933 --> 01:59:46,145
Four of them, four of us.

1434
02:00:16,383 --> 02:00:17,634
Thank you!

1435
02:00:20,721 --> 02:00:22,181
Who is that girl?

1436
02:00:22,431 --> 02:00:24,349
She's creeping me out.

1437
02:00:24,683 --> 02:00:26,268
She's not with any of you, is she?

1438
02:00:26,518 --> 02:00:28,270
Yeah, she's with me.

1439
02:00:38,864 --> 02:00:41,074
So, who's gonna shoot it?

1440
02:00:42,701 --> 02:00:44,620
I want Annie Leibovitz.

1441
02:00:44,870 --> 02:00:47,122
I love Annie's stuff.
She does great stuff.

1442
02:02:28,599 --> 02:02:31,727
I am no good at goodbyes.

1443
02:02:33,061 --> 02:02:34,104
And you...

1444
02:02:34,938 --> 02:02:36,982
...are the last...

1445
02:02:37,232 --> 02:02:41,528
...of my old-time friends.

1446
02:02:43,238 --> 02:02:45,073
Polexia...

1447
02:02:45,282 --> 02:02:48,827
Polexia went to England
with Deep Purple.

1448
02:02:49,286 --> 02:02:51,330
Can you believe that?

1449
02:02:51,622 --> 02:02:54,500
Even Sapphire went someplace else.

1450
02:02:54,750 --> 02:02:57,836
All she left was her Quaaludes.

1451
02:02:59,880 --> 02:03:01,507
Oh, wonderful.

1452
02:03:02,174 --> 02:03:03,675
Where's Beth?

1453
02:03:03,884 --> 02:03:08,263
Where's my friends?
Where are all my friends?

1454
02:03:08,514 --> 02:03:12,184
Front desk?
Could you please send a doctor?

1455
02:03:12,893 --> 02:03:14,353
Room 537.

1456
02:03:14,603 --> 02:03:16,188
Penny, get up!

1457
02:03:16,772 --> 02:03:17,815
I'm up.

1458
02:03:18,524 --> 02:03:22,236
My wife's had an accident
with some Quaaludes.

1459
02:03:22,486 --> 02:03:26,198
- So tired.
- You gotta get up, Penny.

1460
02:03:26,740 --> 02:03:29,201
Penny, get up. Get up.

1461
02:03:29,451 --> 02:03:32,871
You know that.
You know that I'm retired.

1462
02:03:34,540 --> 02:03:39,795
I've always been.
I'm retired, and I'm tired.

1463
02:03:40,045 --> 02:03:43,924
- Jane Abbott.
- Miss Jane Abbott.

1464
02:03:50,013 --> 02:03:52,224
Miss Judy Stanton.

1465
02:03:57,062 --> 02:04:00,983
- Raymond Sanchez.
- Mr. Raymond Sanchez.

1466
02:04:02,276 --> 02:04:03,527
Seats and tray tables.

1467
02:04:03,777 --> 02:04:07,364
Seat back and tables locked.

1468
02:04:07,614 --> 02:04:08,991
And our pending graduate...

1469
02:04:09,825 --> 02:04:12,953
...William Miller, not present.

1470
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:23,297
Why doesn't he love me?

1471
02:04:33,223 --> 02:04:36,018
And to the class of 1973...

1472
02:04:36,226 --> 02:04:41,607
... we say, don't forget to remember
yourselves as you are today:

1473
02:04:41,857 --> 02:04:46,904
Full of hope, and the dream that
everything is possible.

1474
02:04:47,154 --> 02:04:49,948
And remember this,
20 years from now...

1475
02:04:50,199 --> 02:04:52,659
...when we all own home computers...

1476
02:04:52,910 --> 02:04:55,913
...and we all travel
in electrical cars...

1477
02:04:56,163 --> 02:04:59,416
...that move swiftly,
high above our city...

1478
02:04:59,666 --> 02:05:04,421
...that the key to the future,
is keeping today alive...

1479
02:05:04,671 --> 02:05:06,089
...forever!

1480
02:05:06,799 --> 02:05:09,009
Forever! Forever!

1481
02:05:09,218 --> 02:05:12,596
Penny, no! Wake up!

1482
02:05:16,308 --> 02:05:17,351
Well...

1483
02:05:18,060 --> 02:05:20,604
...now that I have your attention...

1484
02:05:22,064 --> 02:05:26,276
...I know you've heard this before,
and I've never said this to anybody.

1485
02:05:27,110 --> 02:05:31,240
Nobody who didn't legally
have to say it back to me.

1486
02:05:31,740 --> 02:05:32,950
But...

1487
02:05:33,700 --> 02:05:35,869
Oh, God, why am I so nervous?

1488
02:05:36,120 --> 02:05:38,163
You'll never remember this.

1489
02:05:39,123 --> 02:05:40,457
I love you.

1490
02:05:41,875 --> 02:05:45,212
And I'm about to boldly go where...

1491
02:05:46,338 --> 02:05:49,174
...many men have gone before.

1492
02:05:58,600 --> 02:05:59,768
Who do we got here?

1493
02:05:59,977 --> 02:06:01,186
- What's her name?
- Emily.

1494
02:06:01,436 --> 02:06:03,272
Okay, sweetheart,
sit up, sit up, sit up.

1495
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:05,983
- Good girl. What'd you take?
- I'll get her legs.

1496
02:06:06,191 --> 02:06:07,693
- What did you take?
- Okay.

1497
02:06:07,943 --> 02:06:10,112
- What did you take?
- I don't know.

1498
02:06:10,362 --> 02:06:12,656
Yes, you do.
Tell us what you took.

1499
02:06:13,532 --> 02:06:15,826
Emily, we have
to pump your stomach, okay?

1500
02:06:16,076 --> 02:06:20,873
- Emily, wake up.
- Got the tubes. Here we go. Water.

1501
02:06:21,123 --> 02:06:23,542
All right, you'll
have to swallow this tube.

1502
02:06:23,792 --> 02:06:26,044
All right? Open, open, open.

1503
02:06:26,295 --> 02:06:28,922
- Come on.
- Don't fight us, we're trying to help.

1504
02:06:29,173 --> 02:06:32,426
- Relax.
- Come on, swallow. Swallow.

1505
02:06:32,634 --> 02:06:33,719
I know. I know.

1506
02:06:33,969 --> 02:06:36,096
Swallow this now.
No, don't bite on it.

1507
02:06:36,346 --> 02:06:38,432
Swallow. Emily, come on, swallow.

1508
02:06:38,682 --> 02:06:41,268
- Just relax. Got it.
- Very good.

1509
02:06:41,518 --> 02:06:43,479
There we go.
All done. All done.

1510
02:06:47,107 --> 02:06:49,735
Feed some liquid into your stomach.

1511
02:07:20,182 --> 02:07:22,559
You never did half
of what you said.

1512
02:07:24,019 --> 02:07:27,064
It was in the middle of
"Midnight Rambler."

1513
02:07:27,314 --> 02:07:31,068
Keith Richards saw me...

1514
02:07:31,318 --> 02:07:35,614
...and came to the front
of the stage. He pulled me out...

1515
02:07:35,864 --> 02:07:38,826
...and he took me backstage...

1516
02:07:39,076 --> 02:07:42,830
...and gave me a Coke, ice...

1517
02:07:43,080 --> 02:07:45,207
...and a lemon.

1518
02:07:46,250 --> 02:07:48,961
And I never went home.

1519
02:07:49,586 --> 02:07:53,173
I've done twice the things
I said I did.

1520
02:07:54,299 --> 02:07:56,301
What about your mom?

1521
02:07:58,971 --> 02:08:01,723
She always said, "Marry up.

1522
02:08:01,932 --> 02:08:04,601
Marry someone grand."

1523
02:08:04,810 --> 02:08:07,563
And that's why she named me "Lady."

1524
02:08:09,731 --> 02:08:12,151
She named you "Lady"?

1525
02:08:13,277 --> 02:08:15,112
Lady Goodman.

1526
02:08:16,947 --> 02:08:18,657
Lady Goodman.

1527
02:08:18,991 --> 02:08:20,325
That's great.

1528
02:08:20,534 --> 02:08:22,619
Now you know all my secrets.

1529
02:08:23,078 --> 02:08:24,705
You've got me.

1530
02:08:27,749 --> 02:08:29,626
See you back in the real world.

1531
02:08:30,919 --> 02:08:32,379
Thank you...

1532
02:08:33,297 --> 02:08:35,132
...William Miller.

1533
02:09:05,788 --> 02:09:07,998
Hey, Lady!

1534
02:09:11,293 --> 02:09:14,880
Welcome to Eastern Airlines
nonstop...

1535
02:09:15,130 --> 02:09:16,673
... to San Diego.

1536
02:09:16,924 --> 02:09:19,176
In preparation
for our departure today...

1537
02:09:19,426 --> 02:09:23,555
... we'd like to ask, please, that
you extinguish all flammable items...

1538
02:09:23,806 --> 02:09:26,475
... and return all seats
and tray tables to their full...

1539
02:09:33,649 --> 02:09:36,068
- that your seat belts
are securely fastened.

1540
02:09:36,318 --> 02:09:39,947
And do make note
of the emergency exits.

1541
02:10:36,545 --> 02:10:39,715
Why didn't you come to the party?
Bob Dylan came.

1542
02:10:39,965 --> 02:10:42,593
He was at our table for
an hour or so, right?

1543
02:10:42,843 --> 02:10:44,052
- Yeah.
- Just rapping.

1544
02:10:44,344 --> 02:10:48,891
Bob Dylan at our fucking table. I was
looking for you to introduce you.

1545
02:10:49,141 --> 02:10:51,143
What happened to you last night?

1546
02:10:51,393 --> 02:10:53,187
It's a long story.

1547
02:11:03,906 --> 02:11:05,741
Hi, this is Craig, your pilot.

1548
02:11:05,991 --> 02:11:08,076
We've caught the edge of
an electrical storm.

1549
02:11:08,285 --> 02:11:09,328
Oh, my God.

1550
02:11:09,536 --> 02:11:11,580
- Electrical storm?
- Buckle up tight.

1551
02:11:12,289 --> 02:11:15,042
- Rock and roll.
- We shouldn't be here.

1552
02:11:16,251 --> 02:11:18,629
- My God!
- Whoa, baby!

1553
02:11:22,466 --> 02:11:24,009
Doris, we miss you!

1554
02:11:26,678 --> 02:11:30,015
All right, listen.
We're gonna try and land in Tupelo.

1555
02:11:30,265 --> 02:11:32,976
- We found a field to land in.
- A field?

1556
02:11:33,227 --> 02:11:34,436
I can't breathe, man.

1557
02:11:34,686 --> 02:11:37,523
It'll be a rough set-down,
but we should be fine.

1558
02:11:37,940 --> 02:11:40,692
Just hang in there,
and we'll get you out of this.

1559
02:11:45,656 --> 02:11:48,784
Everyone says
it's so glamorous out here.

1560
02:11:49,034 --> 02:11:51,662
He just said we're gonna die.

1561
02:11:57,167 --> 02:11:58,210
Oh, my God!

1562
02:12:00,838 --> 02:12:05,300
If something should happen...
Maybe I never said this enough.

1563
02:12:06,885 --> 02:12:08,137
I love all of you.

1564
02:12:15,060 --> 02:12:18,814
I once hit a man in Dearborn,
Michigan. A hit-and-run.

1565
02:12:19,064 --> 02:12:23,819
I hit him and just kept on going.
I don't know if he's alive or dead...

1566
02:12:24,069 --> 02:12:25,487
...but I'm sorry.

1567
02:12:25,737 --> 02:12:28,407
Not a day goes by
I don't see his face.

1568
02:12:28,615 --> 02:12:31,201
Oh, my God!

1569
02:12:31,952 --> 02:12:35,205
Look, I love you all too.
You're like family to me!

1570
02:12:35,456 --> 02:12:37,082
Especially since Marna left me.

1571
02:12:37,332 --> 02:12:41,086
I want you to know, if I took
an extra dollar here and there...

1572
02:12:41,336 --> 02:12:43,338
...it's because I knew I'd earned it.

1573
02:12:43,547 --> 02:12:45,924
- I slept with Marna, Dick.
- I did too.

1574
02:12:46,925 --> 02:12:49,720
I waited until you broke up with her,
but me too.

1575
02:12:52,306 --> 02:12:55,225
I also slept with Leslie,
when you were fighting.

1576
02:12:56,310 --> 02:12:58,896
- You slept with Jeff?
- Yeah, but it didn't count.

1577
02:12:59,146 --> 02:13:01,732
It was the summer we were
free of all rules.

1578
02:13:02,900 --> 02:13:06,612
- And you say you love me!
- I don't love you, man. I never did.

1579
02:13:07,279 --> 02:13:08,906
None of us love you.

1580
02:13:09,156 --> 02:13:13,327
- You act above us. You always have.
- Finally, the truth.

1581
02:13:13,577 --> 02:13:16,371
You just held it over us,
like you might leave.

1582
02:13:16,622 --> 02:13:20,334
Like we're lucky to be with you.
And we had to live with it, man.

1583
02:13:20,918 --> 02:13:22,419
I had to live with you...

1584
02:13:22,669 --> 02:13:26,298
...and now I might die with you,
and it's not fucking fair!

1585
02:13:26,507 --> 02:13:27,674
Please, enough!

1586
02:13:31,887 --> 02:13:33,639
I'm still in love with you, Leslie.

1587
02:13:33,889 --> 02:13:36,558
I don't want to hear any more.
Shut up, Jeffrey!

1588
02:13:37,726 --> 02:13:39,061
- It's all happening.
- What the fuck!

1589
02:13:39,311 --> 02:13:43,315
- Whatever happens, you're dead!
- Don't be self-righteous.

1590
02:13:43,565 --> 02:13:44,817
Not now, man.

1591
02:13:45,067 --> 02:13:48,320
You were sleeping with Penny,
that fucking groupie...

1592
02:13:48,570 --> 02:13:50,114
...last summer up until yesterday.

1593
02:13:50,364 --> 02:13:51,782
Tell Leslie that!

1594
02:13:52,032 --> 02:13:53,450
- Shut up!
- I quit!

1595
02:13:53,617 --> 02:13:56,203
- I'm gonna kill you!
- I quit!

1596
02:13:56,411 --> 02:13:57,955
"That groupie"?!

1597
02:13:58,705 --> 02:14:02,584
She was a Band Aid.
All she did was love your band.

1598
02:14:03,168 --> 02:14:04,628
And you all used her.

1599
02:14:04,878 --> 02:14:08,090
All of you.
You used her and threw her away!

1600
02:14:08,340 --> 02:14:12,344
She almost died last night
while you were with Bob Dylan.

1601
02:14:12,594 --> 02:14:16,265
You're always talking
about the fans, the fans, the fans.

1602
02:14:16,515 --> 02:14:20,602
She was your biggest fan,
and you threw her away!

1603
02:14:20,853 --> 02:14:25,190
And if you can't see that,
that's your biggest problem.

1604
02:14:25,440 --> 02:14:27,734
And I love her! I love her!

1605
02:14:37,411 --> 02:14:38,954
Fuck it!

1606
02:14:39,955 --> 02:14:42,791
I'm... I'm gay!

1607
02:14:57,389 --> 02:15:01,226
Thank God, we're alive!
We're alive! We're gonna make it!

1608
02:16:14,258 --> 02:16:15,843
Write what you want.

1609
02:16:51,211 --> 02:16:53,630
Leave your package on the desk.

1610
02:16:53,881 --> 02:16:57,176
I'm not a messenger,
I'm one of your writers...

1611
02:16:57,384 --> 02:16:59,511
...William H. Miller.

1612
02:17:06,852 --> 02:17:08,854
He's just a kid.

1613
02:17:12,232 --> 02:17:14,026
Go right on in.

1614
02:17:38,175 --> 02:17:40,093
You're William Miller?

1615
02:17:41,970 --> 02:17:46,308
- Yep.
- Oh, baby.

1616
02:17:46,558 --> 02:17:50,395
Did anything happen?
After $600 in room-service bills?

1617
02:17:50,646 --> 02:17:52,439
Did you tape Hammond?

1618
02:17:52,689 --> 02:17:54,942
Where were you?
What did you want to write?

1619
02:17:55,192 --> 02:17:56,860
This reads like their version.

1620
02:17:57,111 --> 02:17:58,821
You obviously saw more
than you wrote about.

1621
02:17:59,071 --> 02:18:02,157
- Something must've happened.
- Push up Flippo's Who cover.

1622
02:18:02,407 --> 02:18:05,119
Good. It'll take me three
days to do this.

1623
02:18:05,369 --> 02:18:06,870
It's all handwritten...

1624
02:18:07,079 --> 02:18:08,789
...on little bits of paper.

1625
02:18:08,997 --> 02:18:11,625
- It's a puff piece.
- They call women "chicks."

1626
02:18:11,875 --> 02:18:14,920
- I have a problem with that.
- You want them to like you.

1627
02:18:15,420 --> 02:18:19,258
Ben, you told me to send what I had!

1628
02:18:19,508 --> 02:18:22,719
It's not finished.
Give me tonight to work on it.

1629
02:18:57,004 --> 02:18:58,922
Oh, man.

1630
02:18:59,798 --> 02:19:01,341
You made friends with them.

1631
02:19:02,843 --> 02:19:05,429
See, friendship is the booze
they feed you...

1632
02:19:06,013 --> 02:19:08,765
...to get you drunk
and feel like you belong.

1633
02:19:09,016 --> 02:19:11,643
Well, it was fun.

1634
02:19:12,019 --> 02:19:14,188
Because they make you feel cool.

1635
02:19:15,063 --> 02:19:20,110
- Hey, I met you. You are not cool.
- I know.

1636
02:19:21,278 --> 02:19:23,614
Even when I thought I was,
I knew I wasn't.

1637
02:19:23,864 --> 02:19:26,241
Because we are uncool.

1638
02:19:27,159 --> 02:19:30,829
While women will always be
a problem for guys like us...

1639
02:19:31,079 --> 02:19:34,583
...most of the great art in the world
is about that very problem.

1640
02:19:35,584 --> 02:19:38,545
Good-looking people,
they got no spine.

1641
02:19:39,213 --> 02:19:41,673
Their art never lasts.

1642
02:19:42,299 --> 02:19:44,426
They get the girls, but we're smarter.

1643
02:19:46,428 --> 02:19:50,516
- Yeah, I can really see that now.
- Because great art is about...

1644
02:19:50,766 --> 02:19:53,811
...guilt and longing...

1645
02:19:54,061 --> 02:19:57,689
...and love disguised as sex,
and sex disguised as love.

1646
02:19:57,940 --> 02:20:02,111
Hey, let's face it,
you got a big head start.

1647
02:20:02,319 --> 02:20:03,570
I'm glad you were home.

1648
02:20:03,821 --> 02:20:06,532
I'm always home. I'm uncool.

1649
02:20:07,199 --> 02:20:09,868
- Me too.
- You're doing great, you know?

1650
02:20:10,494 --> 02:20:12,871
The only true currency in
this bankrupt world...

1651
02:20:13,122 --> 02:20:16,333
...is what you share with someone else
when you're uncool.

1652
02:20:17,543 --> 02:20:19,711
Listen, my advice to you...

1653
02:20:19,962 --> 02:20:22,548
... I know you think
these guys are your friends...

1654
02:20:23,423 --> 02:20:27,594
...if you want to be a true friend to
them, be honest...

1655
02:20:27,845 --> 02:20:30,472
...and unmerciful.

1656
02:20:31,765 --> 02:20:36,520
"I'm flying over Tupelo, Mississippi,
with America's hottest band...

1657
02:20:36,770 --> 02:20:39,356
...and we're all about to die."

1658
02:20:40,274 --> 02:20:43,485
- Dark, lively.
- Yeah, yeah, and it gets better.

1659
02:20:43,694 --> 02:20:47,990
- Did this all really happen?
- I'll check the quotes.

1660
02:20:51,660 --> 02:20:54,830
I just got off the phone
with Rolling Stone.

1661
02:20:55,038 --> 02:20:58,500
- Me too. What's he using?
- He's using it all.

1662
02:20:58,709 --> 02:21:00,544
This according to the fact checker.

1663
02:21:00,752 --> 02:21:03,338
- So what.
- "So what"?

1664
02:21:03,547 --> 02:21:05,549
We come off like amateurs.

1665
02:21:05,757 --> 02:21:09,970
Some average band trying to
come to grips with success.

1666
02:21:10,179 --> 02:21:12,639
Jealous and fighting
and breaking up.

1667
02:21:12,848 --> 02:21:17,561
We're buffoons!
"Rock'n'roll can save the world"?

1668
02:21:17,769 --> 02:21:21,148
"The chicks are great"?
I sound like a dick.

1669
02:21:21,398 --> 02:21:23,525
- You are a dick.
- I never said that.

1670
02:21:23,776 --> 02:21:26,361
Maybe we don't see ourselves
the way we really are.

1671
02:21:26,945 --> 02:21:30,073
Is it that hard
to make us look cool?

1672
02:21:30,908 --> 02:21:34,495
He has you on acid, screaming,
"I'm a golden god."

1673
02:21:34,745 --> 02:21:38,832
They used him to fuck us. They'll
probably just put you on the cover.

1674
02:21:39,082 --> 02:21:41,293
Wait. I never said,
"I'm a golden god."

1675
02:21:44,004 --> 02:21:45,339
Or did I?

1676
02:21:45,589 --> 02:21:48,217
We never took him seriously.
Now it's serious.

1677
02:21:48,634 --> 02:21:50,093
I liked him as a person.

1678
02:21:50,302 --> 02:21:54,223
He was never a person.
He was a journalist!

1679
02:21:54,556 --> 02:21:58,227
You had the right idea
all along.

1680
02:21:58,811 --> 02:22:01,730
- How about the flight?
- It's all there.

1681
02:22:02,022 --> 02:22:04,358
It's unspecific who says what.

1682
02:22:04,608 --> 02:22:07,611
No names are noted in
the embarrassing sequences.

1683
02:22:07,820 --> 02:22:10,614
It's just obvious who's who
and we're fucked!

1684
02:22:10,823 --> 02:22:14,618
I told him he could write
what he wanted.

1685
02:22:18,038 --> 02:22:20,040
They haven't talked to Russell.

1686
02:22:20,290 --> 02:22:25,045
Deny it to the fact checker.
One call. Then they can't print it.

1687
02:22:25,295 --> 02:22:28,257
- Is that true?
- This is war, my friend.

1688
02:22:28,465 --> 02:22:31,760
If you'd met me earlier,
he'd have never been here.

1689
02:22:31,969 --> 02:22:35,639
He'll live.
Let's identify the goals here:

1690
02:22:36,390 --> 02:22:40,602
T-shirts, foreign markets, your
contract, merchandising...

1691
02:22:40,811 --> 02:22:42,771
...happiness...

1692
02:22:42,980 --> 02:22:46,775
...realizing your dreams,
money, cool...

1693
02:22:47,067 --> 02:22:49,027
...meeting the Beatles.

1694
02:22:49,236 --> 02:22:54,783
Let's put all of it in the pot.
It all depends on mystique.

1695
02:22:55,242 --> 02:22:57,995
Not giving too much away.

1696
02:22:58,370 --> 02:23:00,664
I'm going to L.A.
Call if you need me.

1697
02:23:00,873 --> 02:23:05,169
Before I go,
let me give you a lesson in mystique.

1698
02:23:05,377 --> 02:23:09,006
You can only have one.
Which one do you want?

1699
02:23:09,214 --> 02:23:11,800
Which one are you gonna choose?

1700
02:23:13,427 --> 02:23:16,305
As long as you can't see
what's in this hand...

1701
02:23:17,806 --> 02:23:20,392
...you'll always want it more.

1702
02:23:24,104 --> 02:23:26,064
It's phenomenal,
to be honest with you.

1703
02:23:26,315 --> 02:23:29,443
Sophisticated, intelligent.
We only cut out a couple of graphs.

1704
02:23:29,693 --> 02:23:32,696
Jeff Bebe's mom sent over
a shoebox full of childhood photos.

1705
02:23:32,946 --> 02:23:34,907
- She did?
- It's gonna look fantastic.

1706
02:23:35,157 --> 02:23:39,453
The band just denied 90 percent
of the story. It's a fabrication.

1707
02:23:40,329 --> 02:23:43,749
You weren't honest.
And worse, you wasted our time.

1708
02:23:45,375 --> 02:23:47,753
Did you talk to Russell Hammond?

1709
02:23:48,128 --> 02:23:49,963
He's the one who denied it.

1710
02:23:50,214 --> 02:23:52,174
- Now wait a second.
- Denied it.

1711
02:23:53,759 --> 02:23:56,970
We're going with The Who.
Manuscript's in my office.

1712
02:23:57,179 --> 02:23:59,932
He's just some fan.
What do you expect?

1713
02:24:01,642 --> 02:24:03,310
Ben! Wait!

1714
02:24:28,085 --> 02:24:30,045
You guys, this is my brother.

1715
02:24:30,629 --> 02:24:33,674
- Nice to finally meet you.
- You have a good day.

1716
02:24:35,008 --> 02:24:36,844
You guys, I'll deadhead back later.

1717
02:24:37,553 --> 02:24:39,012
I think I'm needed.

1718
02:24:41,223 --> 02:24:42,516
See you.

1719
02:24:49,148 --> 02:24:51,233
You look awful.

1720
02:24:52,484 --> 02:24:53,777
But it's great.

1721
02:24:53,986 --> 02:24:55,904
You're living your life.

1722
02:24:56,155 --> 02:24:58,574
You're free of Mom.

1723
02:25:02,536 --> 02:25:05,873
Hey, I'll take off work.

1724
02:25:06,123 --> 02:25:09,793
Let's have an adventure together.
You and me, finally.

1725
02:25:10,502 --> 02:25:15,424
Anywhere you want to go.
Anywhere in the world.

1726
02:25:17,050 --> 02:25:19,178
This isn't my idea of a good time.

1727
02:25:20,471 --> 02:25:22,723
- Just get me to my bed.
- I'll deal with her.

1728
02:26:07,226 --> 02:26:09,019
I forgive you.

1729
02:26:11,313 --> 02:26:13,398
I didn't apologize.

1730
02:26:46,765 --> 02:26:48,016
Hey, Sapphire.

1731
02:26:48,225 --> 02:26:49,726
Hey, boy.

1732
02:26:51,228 --> 02:26:54,481
- I hate goodbyes.
- Me too.

1733
02:26:55,941 --> 02:26:58,360
All right, so I didn't like you much.

1734
02:26:58,569 --> 02:27:00,863
Do we have to like each other?

1735
02:27:01,572 --> 02:27:04,616
I sort of thought so.

1736
02:27:04,908 --> 02:27:08,829
I think it would've worked
against us, I really do.

1737
02:27:09,037 --> 02:27:13,333
You know what they say: All the
great partnerships hated each other.

1738
02:27:14,042 --> 02:27:16,336
We didn't hate
each other that much, did we?

1739
02:27:16,545 --> 02:27:18,255
No, maybe not.

1740
02:27:18,714 --> 02:27:21,175
I could work on it, though.

1741
02:27:27,389 --> 02:27:30,601
I just can't picture you
with Leslie.

1742
02:27:31,435 --> 02:27:35,522
I'm the you they get,
when they can't get you.

1743
02:27:48,786 --> 02:27:51,163
- Sorry.
- Forget it. It's cool.

1744
02:27:51,371 --> 02:27:54,792
- I'll see you later on.
- All right. See you.

1745
02:28:05,636 --> 02:28:07,429
Is Penny okay?

1746
02:28:08,597 --> 02:28:10,265
The Quaaludes incident?

1747
02:28:11,016 --> 02:28:13,101
Well, it wasn't pretty.

1748
02:28:13,352 --> 02:28:15,062
She could've died.

1749
02:28:16,396 --> 02:28:20,609
I always told her not to let
too many guys fall in love with her.

1750
02:28:20,818 --> 02:28:23,612
Guess I was wrong.
One of them saved her life.

1751
02:28:25,364 --> 02:28:26,406
William?

1752
02:28:26,657 --> 02:28:30,369
What do you care? I mean,
we all know what you did to him.

1753
02:28:30,619 --> 02:28:33,205
I mean, everybody knows.

1754
02:28:34,873 --> 02:28:36,750
Even Penny Lane.

1755
02:28:43,090 --> 02:28:46,135
Something tells me,
20 years from now...

1756
02:28:46,677 --> 02:28:49,304
...we'll remember her.

1757
02:28:49,847 --> 02:28:52,683
And not much else.

1758
02:28:59,565 --> 02:29:01,525
Can you believe these girls?

1759
02:29:01,817 --> 02:29:05,195
None of them use birth control,
and they eat all the steak.

1760
02:29:06,196 --> 02:29:10,117
I mean, they don't even know
what it is to be a fan.

1761
02:29:10,826 --> 02:29:14,997
You know, to truly love some
silly little piece of music...

1762
02:29:15,247 --> 02:29:19,209
...or some band so much...

1763
02:29:19,418 --> 02:29:20,878
...that it hurts.

1764
02:29:28,135 --> 02:29:29,178
Hello, Penny?

1765
02:29:29,428 --> 02:29:31,472
It's Russell. Don't hang up.

1766
02:29:31,722 --> 02:29:34,808
I can't really talk now.
I'm in a roomful of people.

1767
02:29:43,317 --> 02:29:45,194
Actually, I'm alone.

1768
02:29:47,738 --> 02:29:49,156
I won't call again, I promise.

1769
02:29:50,365 --> 02:29:54,119
But I need to see you face to face...

1770
02:29:54,328 --> 02:29:57,539
... because I'm never
as good as when you're there...

1771
02:29:57,748 --> 02:30:02,252
... and I can see myself
the way you look at me.

1772
02:30:02,461 --> 02:30:06,965
And I'm sorry. If we could
just get together and talk...

1773
02:30:12,554 --> 02:30:14,640
Let's say all the things
we never said.

1774
02:30:19,019 --> 02:30:20,270
Give me your address.

1775
02:30:22,898 --> 02:30:24,691
I'm coming to you...

1776
02:30:25,609 --> 02:30:27,194
...this time.

1777
02:30:41,542 --> 02:30:43,377
Got a pen?

1778
02:31:02,271 --> 02:31:03,772
Hello, Penny.

1779
02:31:04,022 --> 02:31:05,816
Hello, Penny.

1780
02:31:17,744 --> 02:31:19,580
I'm Russell Hammond.

1781
02:31:20,998 --> 02:31:24,793
So this is the famous Russell Hammond.

1782
02:31:30,883 --> 02:31:32,092
Come in.

1783
02:31:38,182 --> 02:31:41,894
- Is she home?
- Who? Anita?

1784
02:31:50,068 --> 02:31:51,445
- Where am I?
- Hello?

1785
02:31:52,279 --> 02:31:53,322
Hi.

1786
02:31:53,989 --> 02:31:57,451
You know, when we spoke,
I felt that we connected.

1787
02:32:20,682 --> 02:32:22,976
Oh, man...

1788
02:32:30,776 --> 02:32:33,320
My son is very important to me too.

1789
02:32:33,570 --> 02:32:36,198
And I do think you owe him
an apology.

1790
02:32:37,324 --> 02:32:40,494
- I appreciate you showing up.
- No, no, I agree.

1791
02:32:45,499 --> 02:32:48,627
There's hope for you yet, Russell.

1792
02:33:03,684 --> 02:33:04,893
Well...

1793
02:33:11,024 --> 02:33:12,151
Hi.

1794
02:33:13,485 --> 02:33:15,320
So this is...

1795
02:33:17,281 --> 02:33:18,991
...where the Enemy sleeps.

1796
02:33:25,414 --> 02:33:28,876
You know, I think we both
wanted to be with her.

1797
02:33:33,755 --> 02:33:36,175
And she wanted us to be together.

1798
02:33:51,482 --> 02:33:53,358
You should give her a call.

1799
02:33:54,193 --> 02:33:55,903
You both live in the same city.

1800
02:34:01,241 --> 02:34:03,535
- You really think I should?
- Yeah.

1801
02:34:06,872 --> 02:34:09,333
That girl really cares about you.

1802
02:34:12,252 --> 02:34:14,129
Man, I never even knew her real name.

1803
02:34:21,220 --> 02:34:24,348
Oh, I called your magazine...

1804
02:34:25,057 --> 02:34:27,059
...and told them the truth.

1805
02:34:29,394 --> 02:34:33,315
I don't know what they'll do, but I
said every word you wrote was true.

1806
02:34:40,697 --> 02:34:44,785
We are gonna do this one more time.

1807
02:34:56,880 --> 02:34:57,923
So, Russell...

1808
02:35:00,926 --> 02:35:03,345
...what do you love about music?

1809
02:35:13,814 --> 02:35:15,649
To begin with...

1810
02:35:17,067 --> 02:35:18,360
...everything.

1811
02:35:26,743 --> 02:35:28,787
- Tickets!
- How much?

1812
02:35:45,220 --> 02:35:47,431
Morocco.
Seat by the window, please.

1813
02:35:55,981 --> 02:35:57,441
Thank you.

1814
