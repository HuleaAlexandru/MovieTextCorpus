1
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:52,594
- Is everything in place?
- You're not to relieve me.

2
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,472
I know, but I felt like taking a shift.

3
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:58,391
You like him, don't you?
You like watching him.

4
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,644
- Don't be ridiculous.
- We're going to kill him.

5
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:04,355
Morpheus believes he is the One.

6
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:05,565
Do you?

7
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,567
It doesn't matter what I believe.

8
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,444
You don't, do you?

9
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,780
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

10
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,615
Are you sure this line is clean?

11
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,867
Yeah, of course I'm sure.

12
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:17,660
I better go.

13
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,408
- Freeze! Police!
- Hands on your head!

14
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:59,035
Do it! Do it now!

15
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,059
- Lieutenant.
- Oh, shit.

16
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:27,105
Lieutenant, you were given
specific orders.

17
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,065
I'm just doing my job.

18
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:34,112
You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion"
crap, you can cram it up your ass.

19
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:37,073
The orders were for your protection.

20
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:40,785
I think we can handle one little girl.

21
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,667
I sent two units!

22
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,502
They're bringing her down now!

23
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,881
No, lieutenant, your men
are already dead.

24
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,036
Shit.

25
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,041
Morpheus, the line was traced.
I don't know how.

26
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:29,918
I know. They cut the hard line.

27
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,295
There's no time.
Get to another exit.

28
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,964
- Are there any agents?
- Yes.

29
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:36,341
Goddamn it.

30
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:38,134
You have to focus, Trinity.

31
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,762
There's a phone at Wells and Lake.

32
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,805
You can make it.

33
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:44,724
- All right.
- Go.

34
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,912
That's impossible.

35
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,907
Get up, Trinity. Just get up.

36
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:26,784
Get up.

37
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,165
She got out.

38
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,750
It doesn't matter.

39
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:19,170
- The informant is real.
- Yes.

40
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,089
We have the name of their next target.

41
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,007
The name is Neo.

42
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,804
We'll need a search running.

43
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:30,014
It has already begun.

44
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,987
What?

45
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,244
What the hell?

46
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:42,837
"Follow the white rabbit. "

47
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:55,850
Who is it?

48
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,393
It's Choi.

49
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,358
Yeah. Yeah.

50
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,074
You're two hours late.

51
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,410
I know. It's her fault.

52
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:15,661
You got the money?

53
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:18,956
Two grand.

54
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,958
Hold on.

55
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,019
Hallelujah.

56
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,147
You're my savior.
My own personal Jesus Christ.

57
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,274
You get caught using that....

58
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,652
I know. This never happened.
You don't exist.

59
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,863
- Right.
- Something wrong, man?

60
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,157
You look a little whiter than usual.

61
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,452
My computer, it....

62
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:04,001
Ever have that feeling where you're
not sure if you're awake or dreaming?

63
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:07,547
All the time.
It's called mescaline.

64
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,174
It's the only way to fly.

65
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,553
It just sounds like you
need to unplug.

66
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,305
Get some R and R?

67
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:20,476
What do you think, Dujour?
Should we take him with us?

68
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,688
Definitely.

69
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:27,024
No, I can't. I have work tomorrow.

70
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:28,776
Come on.

71
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,654
It'll be fun. I promise.

72
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,662
Yeah.

73
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,331
Sure. I'll go.

74
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,027
Hello, Neo.

75
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,529
How do you know that name?

76
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,073
I know a lot about you.

77
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,035
- Who are you?
- My name is Trinity.

78
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,203
Trinity.

79
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:23,998
The Trinity?

80
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,167
That cracked the IRS D-base?

81
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:27,877
That was a long time ago.

82
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,046
- Jesus.
- What?

83
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,298
I just thought...

84
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,217
...you were a guy.

85
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:36,927
Most guys do.

86
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,348
That was you on my computer.

87
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,058
How did you do that?

88
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:45,436
Right now, all I can tell you...

89
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:47,605
...is that you're in danger.

90
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,483
- I brought you here to warn you.
- Of what?

91
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,735
They're watching you, Neo.

92
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,738
- Who is?
- Please just listen.

93
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,077
I know why you're here, Neo.

94
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,829
I know what you've been doing.

95
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,956
I know why you hardly sleep...

96
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:09,377
...why you live alone and why,
night after night...

97
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,962
...you sit at your computer.

98
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,674
You're looking for him.

99
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,469
I know, because I was once
looking for the same thing.

100
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,097
And when he found me...

101
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,809
...he told me I wasn't really
looking for him...

102
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,478
...I was looking for an answer.

103
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:31,232
It's the question that drives us, Neo.

104
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,568
It's the question
that brought you here.

105
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:38,030
You know the question...

106
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,782
...just as I did.

107
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,952
What is the Matrix?

108
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,663
The answer is out there, Neo.

109
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,332
It's looking for you.

110
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,793
And it will find you...

111
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:53,087
...if you want it to.

112
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:00,845
Shit.

113
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,221
Shit, shit.

114
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,317
You have a problem with authority,
Mr. Anderson.

115
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:19,613
You believe that you are special,
that the rules do not apply to you.

116
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,324
Obviously, you are mistaken.

117
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:28,164
This is one of the top
software companies in the world...

118
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,792
...because employees understand
they are part of a whole.

119
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:36,672
Thus, if an employee has a problem,
the company has a problem.

120
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:42,136
The time has come to make
a choice, Mr. Anderson.

121
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:46,891
Either you choose to be at your desk
on time from this day forth...

122
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,102
...or you choose to find another job.

123
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,313
Do I make myself clear?

124
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,982
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.
Perfectly clear.

125
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,325
Thomas Anderson?

126
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:07,995
Yeah, that's me.

127
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:09,997
Okay.

128
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,171
Great.

129
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,757
Have a nice day.

130
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,273
Hello?

131
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,902
Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?

132
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,906
- Morpheus.
- Yes.

133
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,158
I've been looking for you.

134
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,578
I don't know if you're ready to see
what I want to show you.

135
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,998
But unfortunately, you and I
have run out of time.

136
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,961
They're coming for you, and I don't know
what they're going to do.

137
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:58,546
Who's coming for me?

138
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,881
Stand up and see for yourself.

139
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,633
What? Right now?

140
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,427
Yes. Now.

141
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,180
Do it slowly.

142
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:09,807
The elevator.

143
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,480
- Oh, shit!
- Yes.

144
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,236
What do they want?

145
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:25,739
I don't know. If you don't want
to find out, get out of there.

146
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:26,949
How?

147
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:30,327
I can guide you,
but you must do exactly as I say.

148
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,205
- Okay.
- The cubicle across from you is empty.

149
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,460
- But what if the y-
- Go. Now.

150
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,595
Stay here for just a moment.

151
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,563
When I tell you,
go to the end of the row...

152
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,773
...to the office
at the end of the hall.

153
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:02,401
Stay as low as you can.

154
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:05,821
Go. Now.

155
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:23,756
Good. Now, outside
there is a scaffold.

156
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,802
- How do you know this?
- We don't have time.

157
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:31,889
To your left there's a window.
Go to it.

158
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,684
Open it.

159
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,312
Take the scaffold to the roof.

160
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:41,148
No way! No way!
This is crazy!

161
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,776
There are two ways
out of this building.

162
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:47,821
One is that scaffold.
The other is in their custody.

163
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:51,283
You take a chance either way.
I leave it to you.

164
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,622
This is insane!

165
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,667
Why is this happening to me?

166
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,585
What'd I do?

167
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:04,713
I'm nobody.
I didn't do anything.

168
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,757
I'm gonna die.

169
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,601
Shit!

170
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:38,998
Oh, shit!

171
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,754
I can't do this.

172
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,435
Shit.

173
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:53,530
As you can see, we've had our eye on
you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

174
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,493
It seems that you've been living...

175
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,870
...two lives.

176
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,791
In one life,
you're Thomas A. Anderson...

177
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:07,377
...program writer for
a respectable software company.

178
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,715
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.

179
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:13,425
And you...

180
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:18,639
...help your landlady
carry out her garbage.

181
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:24,269
The other life is lived in computers...

182
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:27,523
...where you go by
the hacker alias "Neo"...

183
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:32,569
...and are guilty of virtually every
computer crime we have a law for.

184
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,823
One of these lives...

185
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:37,908
...has a future.

186
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:40,244
And one of them does not.

187
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:47,793
I'm going to be as forthcoming
as I can be, Mr. Anderson.

188
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,129
You're here...

189
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,714
...because we need your help.

190
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:59,346
We know that you've been contacted
by a certain...

191
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,390
...individual.

192
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:06,353
A man who calls himself "Morpheus. "

193
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:11,358
Whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant.

194
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,027
He is considered by many authorities...

195
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:17,322
...to be the most dangerous man alive.

196
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,243
My colleagues...

197
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:24,621
...believe that I am wasting
my time with you.

198
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:28,333
But I believe you wish
to do the right thing.

199
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:32,129
We're willing to wipe the slate clean...

200
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,631
...give you a fresh start.

201
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:38,051
All we're asking in return
is your cooperation...

202
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:41,805
...in bringing
a known terrorist to justice.

203
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,433
Yeah.

204
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,811
That sounds like a really good deal.

205
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,190
But I got a better one.

206
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:52,941
How about...

207
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,360
...I give you the finger...

208
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,948
...and you give me my phone call.

209
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,994
Mr. Anderson...

210
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,208
...you disappoint me.

211
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:12,085
You can't scare me
with this Gestapo crap.

212
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:13,712
I know my rights.

213
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,464
I want my phone call.

214
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,217
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...

215
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,510
...what good is a phone call...

216
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:24,348
...if you're unable to speak?

217
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:00,342
You're going to help us,
Mr. Anderson...

218
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,011
...whether you want to or not.

219
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:04,698
This line is tapped,
so I must be brief.

220
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:09,244
They got to you first, but they've
underestimated how important you are.

221
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,330
If they knew what I know...

222
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:13,582
...you would probably be dead.

223
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:18,295
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?

224
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:23,383
You are the One, Neo. You may have
spent the last few years...

225
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:26,595
...looking for me, but I've spent
my entire life...

226
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,347
...looking for you.

227
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:32,059
Now, do you still want to meet?

228
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,896
- Yes.
- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.

229
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,324
Get in.

230
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,420
What's this?

231
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:03,215
It's necessary, Neo.
For our protection.

232
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,634
- From what?
- From you.

233
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:08,637
- Take off your shirt.
- What?

234
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:09,971
Stop the car.

235
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,727
Listen, coppertop.

236
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:17,979
We don't have time for 20 Questions.

237
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,857
Right now, there's only one rule:

238
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,484
Our way...

239
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:23,902
...or the highway.

240
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:31,535
Fine.

241
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,872
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.

242
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:39,084
- Why?
- Because you have been down there.

243
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:41,044
You know that road.

244
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,672
You know exactly where it ends.

245
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:48,135
And I know that's
not where you want to be.

246
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,859
Apoc, lights.

247
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,530
Lie back.
Lift up your shirt.

248
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,701
- What's that?
- You're bugged.

249
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,918
Try and relax.

250
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:31,470
Come on.

251
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,222
It's on the move.

252
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:37,225
Come on, you shit.

253
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,313
- You're gonna lose it.
- No, I'm not.

254
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:42,564
Clear!

255
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,283
Jesus Christ!
That thing's real!?

256
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,360
This is it.

257
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,157
Let me give you one piece of advice.

258
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:36,785
Be honest.

259
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:40,580
He knows more than you can imagine.

260
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:50,632
At last.

261
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,260
Welcome, Neo.

262
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,388
As you no doubt have guessed...

263
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:57,889
...I am Morpheus.

264
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,517
It's an honor to meet you.

265
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:02,018
No...

266
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:03,895
...the honor is mine.

267
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:07,315
Please, come. Sit.

268
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:24,040
I imagine...

269
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,210
...that right now you're feeling
a bit like Alice...

270
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,339
...tumbling down the rabbit hole?

271
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:33,258
You could say that.

272
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,803
I can see it in your eyes.

273
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:40,682
You have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees...

274
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,184
...because he's expecting to wake up.

275
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:47,188
Ironically, this is not
far from the truth.

276
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:50,275
Do you believe in fate, Neo?

277
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:51,526
No.

278
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:52,986
Why not?

279
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:56,031
I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.

280
00:26:57,116 --> 00:27:00,452
I know exactly what you mean.

281
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:07,125
Let me tell you why you're here.

282
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:09,711
You know something.

283
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,880
What you know,
you can't explain.

284
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,965
But you feel it.

285
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,468
You felt it your entire life:

286
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:21,222
Something's wrong with the world.
You don't know what, but it's there.

287
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:23,933
Like a splinter in your mind...

288
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:26,061
...driving you mad.

289
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,731
It is this feeling
that has brought you to me.

290
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:34,110
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

291
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,280
The Matrix?

292
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:41,451
Do you want to know...

293
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:43,912
...what it is?

294
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,166
The Matrix is everywhere.

295
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,126
It is all around us.

296
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:52,337
Even now, in this very room.

297
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,382
You can see it when you
look out your window...

298
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,967
...or when you turn on your television.

299
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:00,929
You can feel it when you go to work...

300
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,140
...when you go to church...

301
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,643
...when you pay your taxes.

302
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,689
It is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes...

303
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,524
...to blind you from the truth.

304
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:15,985
What truth?

305
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:21,783
That you are a slave.

306
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,578
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage...

307
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:30,500
...born into a prison that you cannot
smell or taste or touch.

308
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:32,085
A prison...

309
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:33,461
...for your mind.

310
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,804
Unfortunately, no one can be...

311
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:45,515
...told what the Matrix is.

312
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:50,854
You have to see it for yourself.

313
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,657
This is your last chance.

314
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,243
After this, there is no turning back.

315
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:07,162
You take the blue pill...

316
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:10,540
...the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe...

317
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,584
...whatever you want to believe.

318
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,169
You take the red pill...

319
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,379
...you stay in Wonderland...

320
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:19,591
...and I show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.

321
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:30,685
Remember...

322
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,564
...all I'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.

323
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:50,205
Follow me.

324
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,417
Apoc, are we on-line?

325
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,044
Almost.

326
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,424
Time is always against us.

327
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:03,301
Please take a seat there.

328
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,196
- You did all this?
- Mm-hm.

329
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,327
The pill you took is
part of a trace program.

330
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:34,707
It disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.

331
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:36,292
What does that mean?

332
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:39,045
It means buckle your
seat belt, Dorothy...

333
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,713
...because Kansas...

334
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:42,006
...is going bye-bye.

335
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,296
Did you...?

336
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:36,394
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?

337
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:40,440
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?

338
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:43,192
How would you know the difference
between the dream world...

339
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,236
...and the real world?

340
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:48,031
This can't be.

341
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:49,240
Be what?

342
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,451
Be real?

343
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,831
- Going into replication.
- Apoc?

344
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,041
Still nothing.

345
00:31:58,626 --> 00:31:59,834
It's cold.

346
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,461
It's cold!

347
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:07,008
Tank, we'll need a signal soon.

348
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,179
- I got a fibrillation.
- Apoc, location.

349
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,889
Targeting almost there.

350
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:17,602
He's going into arrest.

351
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,355
- Lock. I got him!
- Now, Tank, now!

352
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:18,699
Welcome...

353
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,952
...to the real world.

354
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:24,205
We've done it, Trinity.

355
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:25,998
We found him.

356
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:29,043
- I hope you're right.
- I don't have to hope.

357
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,212
I know it.

358
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:37,426
Am I dead?

359
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:40,096
Far from it.

360
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,486
He still needs a lot of work.

361
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,114
What are you doing?

362
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:00,575
Your muscles atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.

363
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,702
Why do my eyes hurt?

364
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:05,288
You've never used them before.

365
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,084
Rest, Neo.

366
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,003
The answers are coming.

367
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,162
Morpheus, what's happened to me?

368
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:29,872
What is this place?

369
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:32,792
More important than "what" is "when. "

370
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:34,335
"When"?

371
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,587
You believe it's the year 1999...

372
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,090
...when in fact, it's closer to 2199.

373
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:42,969
I can't tell you exactly
what year it is...

374
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,845
...because we honestly don't know.

375
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:48,182
There's nothing I can say
that will explain it for you.

376
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:51,185
Come with me.
See for yourself.

377
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:53,479
This is my ship.

378
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,691
The Nebuchadnezzar.
It's a hovercraft.

379
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:01,279
This is the main deck.

380
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,286
This is the core...

381
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:14,542
...where we broadcast our pirate signal
and hack into the Matrix.

382
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:21,090
Most of my crew you already know.

383
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:27,513
This is Apoc...

384
00:38:28,307 --> 00:38:29,640
...Switch...

385
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,393
...and Cypher.
- Hi.

386
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:36,355
The ones you don't know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

387
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:39,650
The little one behind you is Mouse.

388
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:47,241
You wanted to know
what the Matrix is?

389
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:49,493
Trinity.

390
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,099
Try to relax.

391
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,814
This will feel a little weird.

392
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:32,161
This...

393
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:34,038
...is the Construct.

394
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,582
It's our loading program.

395
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,293
We can load anything, from clothing...

396
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:40,920
...to equipment...

397
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,546
...weapons...

398
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:45,007
...training simulations...

399
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:47,927
...anything we need.

400
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:53,140
Right now we're inside
a computer program?

401
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,351
Is it really so hard to believe?

402
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:58,479
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your body are gone.

403
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,774
Your hair has changed.

404
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,486
Your appearance now is what we call
"residual self-image. "

405
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:08,823
It is the mental projection
of your digital self.

406
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:15,830
This isn't real?

407
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:17,623
What is "real"?

408
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,251
How do you define "real"?

409
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:22,461
If you're talking about
what you can feel...

410
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:25,131
...what you can smell, taste and see...

411
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:29,260
...then "real" is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.

412
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:35,850
This is the world that you know.

413
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:40,312
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.

414
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:47,027
It exists now only as part of
a neural-interactive simulation...

415
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,529
...that we call the Matrix.

416
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:55,870
You've been living
in a dream world, Neo.

417
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:57,997
This is the world...

418
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,040
...as it exists today.

419
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:16,056
Welcome to "the desert...

420
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:18,517
...of the real. "

421
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:24,273
We have only bits and pieces
of information.

422
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:28,319
But what we know for certain
is that in the early 21st century...

423
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:31,822
...all of mankind was united
in celebration.

424
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:36,827
We marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to Al.

425
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:38,746
Al.

426
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,165
You mean artificial intelligence.

427
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:45,836
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.

428
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:50,132
We don't know who struck first,
us or them.

429
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,761
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.

430
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,598
They were dependent on solar power...

431
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:01,185
...and it was believed that
they would be unable to survive...

432
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,022
...without an energy source
as abundant as the sun.

433
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:10,152
Throughout human history, we have
been dependent on machines to survive.

434
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:15,824
Fate, it seems, is not
without a sense of irony.

435
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:23,457
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.

436
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:27,836
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

437
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:31,924
Combined with a form of fusion...

438
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:37,096
...the machines had found all the energy
they would ever need.

439
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:44,895
There are fields, Neo,
endless fields...

440
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:48,399
...where human beings
are no longer born.

441
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:50,943
We are grown.

442
00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:59,577
For the longest time,
I wouldn't believe it.

443
00:42:59,828 --> 00:43:02,496
And then I saw the fields
with my own eyes...

444
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:05,457
...watched them liquefy the dead...

445
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:09,044
...so they could be fed intravenously
to the living.

446
00:43:09,588 --> 00:43:13,841
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision...

447
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:17,011
...I came to realize
the obviousness of the truth.

448
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,432
What is the Matrix?

449
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:23,684
Control.

450
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:28,439
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world...

451
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:32,318
...built to keep us under control...

452
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:36,655
...in order to change a human being...

453
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:38,449
...into this.

454
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:40,951
No.

455
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:44,163
I don't believe it.

456
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:45,748
It's not possible.

457
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:50,919
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.

458
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:52,463
Stop!

459
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:54,214
Let me out!

460
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:56,842
Let me out! I want out!

461
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:01,472
- Easy, Neo. Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.

462
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:03,390
Get this thing out of me!

463
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:06,685
Don't touch me!

464
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:08,562
Stay away from me!

465
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:14,151
I don't believe it.

466
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,445
- He's gonna pop.
- Breathe, Neo.

467
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:17,905
Just breathe.

468
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:38,092
I can't go back, can I?

469
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:40,344
No.

470
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,388
But if you could...

471
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:44,723
...would you really want to?

472
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:48,602
I owe you an apology.

473
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:50,562
We have a rule.

474
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:54,274
We never free a mind
once it's reached a certain age.

475
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:55,526
It's dangerous.

476
00:44:56,236 --> 00:44:57,945
The mind has trouble letting go.

477
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,489
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.

478
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:03,617
I did what I did because...

479
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:05,786
...I had to.

480
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:18,298
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside...

481
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,594
...who had the ability
to change whatever he wanted...

482
00:45:22,971 --> 00:45:25,889
...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

483
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:31,103
It was he who freed the first of us...

484
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,605
...taught us the truth.

485
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:38,152
As long as the Matrix exists...

486
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40,571
...the human race will never be free.

487
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:46,326
After he died...

488
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:49,788
...the Oracle prophesied his return...

489
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:53,542
...and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the Matrix...

490
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:55,461
...end the war...

491
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:57,045
...bring freedom to our people.

492
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:03,010
That is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the Matrix...

493
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:04,928
...looking for him.

494
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:09,433
I did what I did because...

495
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,187
...I believe that search is over.

496
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:19,693
Get some rest.

497
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,112
You're going to need it.

498
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:25,866
For what?

499
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:30,120
Your training.

500
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:50,140
Morning. Did you sleep?

501
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:52,226
You will tonight.

502
00:46:52,602 --> 00:46:54,144
I guarantee it.

503
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:57,564
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.

504
00:46:58,024 --> 00:47:00,442
- You don't have any -
- Holes? Nope.

505
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:06,073
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100%
pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.

506
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:07,533
Born free right here...

507
00:47:08,076 --> 00:47:09,409
...in the real world.

508
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:11,328
Genuine child of Zion.

509
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:14,623
- Zion?
- If the war was over tomorrow...

510
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,375
...Zion's where the party would be.

511
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:18,085
It's a city?

512
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:21,505
The last human city.
The only place we have left.

513
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:24,341
Where is it?

514
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:29,513
Deep underground near the Earth's core,
where it's still warm.

515
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,016
You live long enough,
you might see it.

516
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:40,107
Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited
to see what you're capable of...

517
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,109
...if Morpheus is right and all.

518
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:45,362
We're not supposed to
talk about this, but...

519
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,030
...if you are...

520
00:47:48,116 --> 00:47:50,117
...it's a very exciting time.

521
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,871
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.

522
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,711
We're supposed to start
with these programs first.

523
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:05,173
That's major boring shit.
Let's do something more fun.

524
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:06,967
How about...

525
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:10,304
...combat training?

526
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:17,811
"Jujitsu"?

527
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:20,355
I'm going to learn jujitsu?

528
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:32,910
Holy shit!

529
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:35,495
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it. "

530
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,122
How about some more?

531
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:38,665
Hell, yes.

532
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:41,793
Hell, yeah.

533
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,057
How is he?

534
00:48:55,308 --> 00:48:57,476
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.

535
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:10,072
I know kung fu.

536
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:12,741
Show me.

537
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:16,286
This is a sparring program...

538
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:19,331
...similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix.

539
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:21,917
It has the same basic rules.
Like gravity.

540
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:25,629
These rules are no different
than those of a computer system.

541
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,673
Some of them can be bent.

542
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:30,342
Others can be broken.

543
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:31,969
Understand?

544
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:34,096
Then hit me...

545
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:35,806
...if you can.

546
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:15,846
Good!

547
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:17,764
Adaptation.

548
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:19,266
Improvisation.

549
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:20,892
But your weakness...

550
00:50:21,144 --> 00:50:22,519
...is not your technique.

551
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:31,570
Morpheus is fighting Neo.

552
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:45,018
How did I beat you?

553
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:52,692
You're too fast.

554
00:51:53,236 --> 00:51:54,569
Do you believe that...

555
00:51:54,946 --> 00:51:57,447
...my being stronger or faster...

556
00:51:57,698 --> 00:52:01,368
...has anything to do
with my muscles in this place?

557
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:07,207
You think you're breathing air?

558
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:21,930
Again!

559
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:35,819
Jesus Christ, he's fast!

560
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:38,280
His neuro-kinetics
are way above normal.

561
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:45,203
What are you waiting for?

562
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:47,414
You're faster than this.

563
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:51,835
Don't think you are.

564
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:53,753
Know you are.

565
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,933
Come on! Stop trying to hit me,
and hit me!

566
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:18,612
I don't believe it.

567
00:53:20,156 --> 00:53:22,282
I know what you're trying to do.

568
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:26,119
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.

569
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:28,538
But I can only show you the door.

570
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:30,957
You have to walk through it.

571
00:53:33,336 --> 00:53:35,462
Tank, load the jump program.

572
00:53:47,058 --> 00:53:49,768
You have to let it all go, Neo.
Fear...

573
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:52,479
...doubt and disbelief.

574
00:53:53,648 --> 00:53:56,358
Free your mind.

575
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:05,742
Whoa.

576
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:14,251
Okey-dokey.

577
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:17,504
Free my mind.

578
00:54:17,964 --> 00:54:19,089
What if he makes it?

579
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:22,050
- No one's ever made their first jump.
- I know.

580
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:25,845
- But what if he does?
- He won't.

581
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,514
Come on.

582
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:28,932
All right.

583
00:54:29,392 --> 00:54:31,434
No problem. Free my mind.

584
00:54:32,228 --> 00:54:35,021
Free my mind. No problem. Right.

585
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:56,084
What does that mean?

586
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,295
It doesn't mean anything.

587
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:01,464
Everybody falls the first time.

588
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:03,216
Right, Trin?

589
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:26,531
- I thought it wasn't real.
- Your mind makes it real.

590
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:32,037
If you're killed in the Matrix...

591
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:33,246
...you die here?

592
00:55:33,873 --> 00:55:36,333
The body cannot live without the mind.

593
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:10,200
I don't remember you ever
bringing me dinner.

594
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:16,122
There is something about him,
isn't there?

595
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:18,375
You're a believer now?

596
00:56:19,377 --> 00:56:20,585
I keep wondering...

597
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:24,506
...if Morpheus is so sure,
why not take him to see the Oracle?

598
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:28,343
Morpheus will take him
when he's ready.

599
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:39,687
The Matrix is a system, Neo.

600
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,732
That system is our enemy.

601
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,693
But when you're inside,
what do you see?

602
00:56:45,945 --> 00:56:49,739
Businessmen, teachers,
lawyers, carpenters.

603
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:52,784
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.

604
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:55,995
But until we do, these people are
a part of that system...

605
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:58,164
...and that makes them our enemy.

606
00:56:58,332 --> 00:56:59,541
You have to understand...

607
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:03,128
...most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged.

608
00:57:03,379 --> 00:57:04,963
And many of them are so inert...

609
00:57:05,214 --> 00:57:07,632
...so hopelessly dependent
on the system...

610
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:10,593
...that they will fight to protect it.

611
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:15,849
Were you listening to me or looking
at the woman in the red dress?

612
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:17,767
- I was -
- Look again.

613
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,103
Freeze it.

614
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:28,361
- This isn't the Matrix?
- No.

615
00:57:30,156 --> 00:57:33,992
It's another training program
designed to teach you one thing:

616
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:37,036
If you are not one of us,
you are one of them.

617
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:40,373
- What are they?
- Sentient programs.

618
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:45,420
They can move in and out of any
software still hardwired to their system.

619
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:49,174
That means that anyone
we haven't unplugged...

620
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:50,842
...is potentially an agent.

621
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:53,636
Inside the Matrix...

622
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:55,930
...they are everyone...

623
00:57:56,265 --> 00:57:57,974
...and they are no one.

624
00:57:58,225 --> 00:58:01,352
We have survived by hiding
and running from them...

625
00:58:01,604 --> 00:58:03,229
...but they are the gatekeepers.

626
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:06,441
They're guarding all the doors
and holding all the keys.

627
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:09,527
Sooner or later, someone will
have to fight them.

628
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:10,904
Someone?

629
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:12,655
I won't lie to you, Neo.

630
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:17,952
Every single man or woman who
has fought an agent, has died.

631
00:58:18,204 --> 00:58:20,580
But where they have failed,
you will succeed.

632
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:21,831
Why?

633
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:24,375
I've seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall.

634
00:58:24,627 --> 00:58:28,213
Men have emptied entire clips at them
and hit nothing but air.

635
00:58:28,464 --> 00:58:33,092
Yet their strength and speed are still
based in a world built on rules.

636
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:34,469
Because of that...

637
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,097
...they will never be as strong
or as fast as you can be.

638
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:44,270
What are you telling me?

639
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,439
That I can dodge bullets?

640
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:49,817
No, Neo.

641
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:53,238
I'm trying to tell you
that when you're ready...

642
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,448
...you won't have to.

643
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:00,787
We got trouble.

644
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:22,183
- Did Zion send the warning?
- No, another ship.

645
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:26,729
Shit.

646
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:29,857
- Squiddy's sweeping in quick.
- Squiddy?

647
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:33,278
A sentinel. A killing machine
designed for one thing.

648
00:59:33,529 --> 00:59:34,737
Search and destroy.

649
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:37,240
Set her down there.

650
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:00,013
How are we doing, Tank?

651
01:00:08,731 --> 01:00:09,897
Power off-line.

652
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:12,358
EMP armed...

653
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:14,444
...and ready.
- EMP?

654
01:00:14,737 --> 01:00:16,613
Electromagnetic pulse.

655
01:00:16,864 --> 01:00:19,741
Disables any electrical system
in the blast radius.

656
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:22,201
It's the only weapon we have
against the machines.

657
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,127
- Where are we?
- Their old service and waste systems.

658
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:33,504
Sewers.

659
01:00:33,714 --> 01:00:36,424
There used to be cities
that spanned hundreds of miles.

660
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:38,843
Now these sewers are
all that's left.

661
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:40,428
Quiet.

662
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:22,470
Whoa! Neo.

663
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:26,474
You scared the bejesus out of me.

664
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:29,477
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

665
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,231
Is that...?

666
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:35,066
The Matrix?

667
01:01:35,234 --> 01:01:36,442
Yeah.

668
01:01:38,237 --> 01:01:41,406
- Do you always look at it encoded?
- Well, you have to.

669
01:01:41,657 --> 01:01:44,742
The image translators work
for the construct program.

670
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:48,413
But there's way too much information
to decode the Matrix.

671
01:01:48,664 --> 01:01:51,624
You get used to it.
I don't even see the code.

672
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:55,294
All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.

673
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:57,839
Do you...

674
01:01:58,132 --> 01:01:59,215
...want a drink?

675
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:00,508
Sure.

676
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:05,513
You know...

677
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:07,974
...I know what you're thinking.

678
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:10,309
Because right now I'm thinking
the same thing.

679
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:13,980
Actually, I've been thinking it
ever since I got here.

680
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:18,901
Why, oh, why didn't I take
the blue pill?

681
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:33,207
Good shit, huh?

682
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:34,751
Dozer makes it.

683
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,377
It's good for two things:

684
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:39,714
Degreasing engines and
killing brain cells.

685
01:02:40,716 --> 01:02:42,925
So can I ask you something?

686
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:47,555
Did he tell you why he did it?

687
01:02:50,184 --> 01:02:52,018
Why you're here?

688
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:57,440
Jesus!

689
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:00,568
What a mind job.

690
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:04,781
So you're here to save the world.

691
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:08,367
What do you say
to something like that?

692
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,916
A little piece of advice.

693
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:18,127
You see an agent...

694
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:20,755
...you do what we do:

695
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:22,632
Run.

696
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:24,717
You run your ass off.

697
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:33,684
Thanks for the drink.

698
01:03:38,398 --> 01:03:39,565
Sweet dreams.

699
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:46,989
- Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

700
01:03:47,658 --> 01:03:48,783
You know...

701
01:03:50,202 --> 01:03:52,662
...I know this steak doesn't exist.

702
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:56,415
I know that when I put it
in my mouth...

703
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:59,752
...the Matrix is telling my brain
that it is...

704
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:01,170
...juicy...

705
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:03,172
...and delicious.

706
01:04:06,093 --> 01:04:07,343
After nine years...

707
01:04:08,387 --> 01:04:09,929
...you know what I realize?

708
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:18,980
Ignorance is bliss.

709
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:25,862
Then we have a deal.

710
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:30,283
I don't want to remember nothing.

711
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:33,035
Nothing. You understand?

712
01:04:36,915 --> 01:04:38,916
And I want to be rich.

713
01:04:40,252 --> 01:04:42,962
You know, someone important.

714
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:45,590
Like an actor.

715
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,927
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

716
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:53,639
Okay.

717
01:04:54,016 --> 01:04:56,434
You get my body
back in a power plant...

718
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,561
...reinsert me into the Matrix...

719
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:00,313
...I'll get you what you want.

720
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:02,565
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.

721
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:04,984
No. I told you, I don't know them.

722
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:09,947
I can get you the man who does.

723
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:12,491
Morpheus.

724
01:05:22,586 --> 01:05:26,047
Here you go, buddy.
Breakfast of champions.

725
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:30,176
Close your eyes, it feels
like you're eating runny eggs.

726
01:05:30,385 --> 01:05:32,094
Or a bowl of snot.

727
01:05:32,638 --> 01:05:34,221
You know what it reminds me of?

728
01:05:36,058 --> 01:05:38,392
Tastee Wheat. Did you
ever eat Tastee Wheat?

729
01:05:39,019 --> 01:05:40,728
No, but technically,
neither did you.

730
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:43,022
That's exactly my point. Exactly.

731
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:44,649
Because you have to wonder...

732
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:48,152
...how do the machines really know
what Tastee Wheat tasted like?

733
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:49,820
Maybe they got it wrong.

734
01:05:50,072 --> 01:05:53,282
Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat
tasted like, actually tasted like...

735
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:55,576
...oatmeal or tuna fish.

736
01:05:55,953 --> 01:05:58,788
That makes you wonder.
Take chicken, for example.

737
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,040
Maybe they didn't know
what to make it taste like...

738
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,334
...which is why it tastes
like everything.

739
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:05,378
- And maybe they -
- Shut up.

740
01:06:07,005 --> 01:06:08,464
It's a single-celled protein...

741
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:11,759
...combined with synthetic aminos,
vitamins and minerals.

742
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:13,260
Everything the body needs.

743
01:06:13,512 --> 01:06:16,389
It doesn't have everything
the body needs.

744
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:22,228
I understand you've run through
the agent training program.

745
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:25,314
You know, I wrote that program.

746
01:06:25,607 --> 01:06:26,899
Here it comes.

747
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:29,110
- What did you think of her?
- Of who?

748
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:32,530
The woman in the red dress.
I designed her.

749
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:35,616
She doesn't talk very much...

750
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:39,829
...but if you'd like to meet her,
I can arrange a more personal milieu.

751
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,455
The digital pimp hard at work.

752
01:06:41,707 --> 01:06:43,958
Pay no attention to
these hypocrites, Neo.

753
01:06:45,252 --> 01:06:47,086
To deny our own impulses...

754
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:50,464
...is to deny the very thing
that makes us human.

755
01:06:52,384 --> 01:06:53,759
Dozer, when you're done...

756
01:06:53,969 --> 01:06:55,553
...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.

757
01:06:56,138 --> 01:06:57,471
We're going in.

758
01:06:58,181 --> 01:06:59,598
I'm taking Neo to see her.

759
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,770
See who?

760
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:07,023
The Oracle.

761
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:14,071
Everyone please observe...

762
01:07:14,406 --> 01:07:17,116
...the "fasten seat belt"
and "no smoking" signs are on.

763
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:20,995
Sit back and enjoy your flight.

764
01:07:45,437 --> 01:07:46,437
We're in.

765
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:03,245
We'll be back in an hour.

766
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:20,012
Unbelievable...

767
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:21,597
...isn't it?

768
01:08:25,185 --> 01:08:27,019
- God!
- What?

769
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:29,063
I used to eat there.

770
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:32,942
Really good noodles.

771
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:40,241
I have these memories from my life.

772
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:44,370
None of them happened.

773
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,330
What does that mean?

774
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:48,791
That the Matrix cannot tell you
who you are.

775
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:50,918
But an oracle can?

776
01:08:51,378 --> 01:08:52,586
That's different.

777
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,551
Did you go to her?

778
01:09:00,095 --> 01:09:01,262
Yes.

779
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:03,139
What did she tell you?

780
01:09:06,393 --> 01:09:07,893
She told me....

781
01:09:08,937 --> 01:09:10,104
What?

782
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,234
We're here.

783
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:17,903
Neo, come with me.

784
01:09:37,883 --> 01:09:40,301
So is this the same oracle
that made...

785
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:41,719
...the prophecy?

786
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:46,307
Yes. She's very old. She's been
with us since the beginning.

787
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:48,767
- The beginning?
- Of the Resistance.

788
01:09:51,021 --> 01:09:53,397
And she knows what? Everything?

789
01:09:55,442 --> 01:09:57,359
She would say she knows enough.

790
01:09:58,486 --> 01:10:00,279
And she's never wrong.

791
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:05,659
Try not to think of it
in terms of right and wrong.

792
01:10:05,994 --> 01:10:07,578
She is a guide, Neo.

793
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:09,830
She can help you to find the path.

794
01:10:10,332 --> 01:10:11,582
She helped you?

795
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:13,334
Yes.

796
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:15,419
What did she tell you?

797
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:20,090
That I would find the One.

798
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,356
I told you I can only
show you the door.

799
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:38,150
You have to walk through it.

800
01:10:41,947 --> 01:10:43,030
Hello, Neo.

801
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:44,949
You're right on time.

802
01:10:52,874 --> 01:10:56,669
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.

803
01:11:02,342 --> 01:11:03,926
These are the other Potentials.

804
01:11:04,177 --> 01:11:05,719
You can wait here.

805
01:11:46,553 --> 01:11:49,096
Do not try and bend the spoon.

806
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:51,598
That's impossible.

807
01:11:52,434 --> 01:11:56,437
Instead, only try
to realize the truth.

808
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:58,355
What truth?

809
01:11:58,606 --> 01:12:00,274
There is no spoon.

810
01:12:02,861 --> 01:12:04,194
There is no spoon?

811
01:12:04,446 --> 01:12:08,907
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon
that bends. It is only yourself.

812
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:26,425
The Oracle will you see now.

813
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:38,687
I know you're Neo.

814
01:12:39,314 --> 01:12:40,481
Be right with you.

815
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:43,901
- You're the Oracle?
- Bingo.

816
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:49,490
Not quite what you
were expecting, right?

817
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:52,701
Almost done.

818
01:12:55,205 --> 01:12:56,830
Smell good, don't they?

819
01:12:58,083 --> 01:12:59,333
Yeah.

820
01:12:59,584 --> 01:13:01,418
I'd ask you to sit down...

821
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:04,046
...but you're not going to anyway.

822
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:07,424
- And don't worry about the vase.
- What vase?

823
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:11,720
That vase.

824
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:13,722
I'm sorry.

825
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:15,849
I said, don't worry about it.

826
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:18,977
I'll get one of my kids to fix it.

827
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:20,813
How did you know?

828
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:26,652
What's really going to bake
your noodle later on is...

829
01:13:26,986 --> 01:13:29,947
...would you still have broken it
if I hadn't said anything?

830
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,662
You're cuter than I thought.

831
01:13:39,707 --> 01:13:41,959
I can see why she likes you.

832
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:43,919
Who?

833
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:46,004
Not too bright, though.

834
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:52,386
You know why Morpheus
brought you to see me.

835
01:13:54,514 --> 01:13:55,681
So...

836
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:58,016
...what do you think?

837
01:13:59,853 --> 01:14:01,603
Do you think you are the One?

838
01:14:03,565 --> 01:14:04,606
I don't know.

839
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:09,445
You know what that means?

840
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,447
It's Latin.

841
01:14:11,823 --> 01:14:14,032
Means, "Know thyself. "

842
01:14:15,493 --> 01:14:17,453
I'll let you in on a little secret.

843
01:14:19,706 --> 01:14:23,542
Being the One is just
like being in love.

844
01:14:24,252 --> 01:14:27,129
No one can tell you you're in love.
You just know it...

845
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:28,505
...through and through.

846
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,883
Balls to bones.

847
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:34,261
Well...

848
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:38,307
...I'd better have a look at you.

849
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:41,143
Open your mouth. Say, "Ah. "

850
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:57,201
Okay....

851
01:14:57,827 --> 01:15:02,789
Now I'm supposed to say,
"Hmm, that's interesting, but...."

852
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:04,416
Then you say:

853
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:06,293
But what?

854
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:10,506
But you already know
what I'm going to tell you.

855
01:15:11,925 --> 01:15:14,885
- I'm not the One.
- Sorry, kid.

856
01:15:16,513 --> 01:15:18,514
You got the gift...

857
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:21,725
...but it looks like
you're waiting for something.

858
01:15:26,397 --> 01:15:27,439
What?

859
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:30,567
Your next life, maybe. Who knows?

860
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:33,403
That's the way these things go.

861
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,865
- What's funny?
- Morpheus.

862
01:15:40,328 --> 01:15:42,037
He almost had me convinced.

863
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:43,413
I know.

864
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:47,084
Poor Morpheus.

865
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:52,589
Without him, we're lost.

866
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:56,301
What do you mean, "without him"?

867
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:02,224
Are you sure you want
to hear this?

868
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:07,187
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.

869
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:11,066
And no one, not you, not even me...

870
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:13,569
...can convince him otherwise.

871
01:16:13,945 --> 01:16:16,321
He believes it so blindly...

872
01:16:16,614 --> 01:16:20,951
...that he's going to sacrifice
his life to save yours.

873
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,327
What?

874
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:25,163
You're going to
have to make a choice.

875
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:29,376
In the one hand,
you'll have Morpheus' life.

876
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:32,754
And in the other hand,
you'll have your own.

877
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:36,466
One of you is going to die.

878
01:16:38,553 --> 01:16:41,847
Which one will be up to you.

879
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:45,142
I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.

880
01:16:45,393 --> 01:16:47,060
You have a good soul.

881
01:16:48,146 --> 01:16:50,856
And I hate giving
good people bad news.

882
01:16:53,985 --> 01:16:55,444
Don't worry about it.

883
01:16:55,695 --> 01:16:58,113
As soon as you
step outside that door...

884
01:16:58,364 --> 01:17:00,490
...you'll start feeling better.

885
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:04,995
You'll remember you don't believe
in any of this fate crap.

886
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:08,582
You're in control of your own life.

887
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:10,709
Remember?

888
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:13,587
Here...

889
01:17:15,465 --> 01:17:17,007
...take a cookie.

890
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:20,886
I promise, by the time
you're done eating it...

891
01:17:21,846 --> 01:17:24,222
...you'll feel right as rain.

892
01:17:33,441 --> 01:17:34,775
What was said...

893
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:36,860
...was for you...

894
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:39,237
...and for you alone.

895
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:03,261
They're on the way.

896
01:18:33,084 --> 01:18:34,126
What is that?

897
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:50,308
Oh, deja vu.

898
01:18:53,813 --> 01:18:54,896
What did you just say?

899
01:18:55,148 --> 01:18:56,648
Nothing.
Just deja vu.

900
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:58,525
- What did you see?
- What happened?

901
01:18:59,944 --> 01:19:02,112
A black cat went past us...

902
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:03,989
...then another just like it.

903
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,782
Was it the same cat?

904
01:19:06,743 --> 01:19:09,578
- I'm not sure.
- Switch, Apoc.

905
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:14,875
What is it?

906
01:19:15,126 --> 01:19:19,546
A deja vu is usually a glitch in the
Matrix when they change something.

907
01:19:22,508 --> 01:19:23,759
Oh, my God.

908
01:19:25,553 --> 01:19:26,553
Let's go.

909
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:33,602
They cut the hard line.
It's a trap! Get out!

910
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:40,317
Oh, no.

911
01:20:20,608 --> 01:20:23,068
That's what they changed.
We're trapped.

912
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:25,195
Be calm. Give me your phone.

913
01:20:25,446 --> 01:20:26,988
They'll be able to track it.

914
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:28,657
We have no choice.

915
01:20:30,076 --> 01:20:31,284
Operator.

916
01:20:31,619 --> 01:20:34,454
Find a structural drawing of
this building. Find it fast.

917
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:44,881
- Got it!
- I need the main wet-wall.

918
01:20:47,718 --> 01:20:48,969
Eighth floor.

919
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:50,762
They're on the eighth floor.

920
01:20:51,055 --> 01:20:52,514
Switch, straight ahead.

921
01:20:53,266 --> 01:20:54,432
Neo....

922
01:21:00,565 --> 01:21:02,691
I hope the Oracle
gave you some good news.

923
01:21:10,992 --> 01:21:12,492
Now left. That's it.

924
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:13,827
Good.

925
01:21:23,546 --> 01:21:24,838
Where are they?

926
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:26,441
They're in the walls.

927
01:22:27,902 --> 01:22:29,069
In the walls!

928
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:52,133
It's an agent!

929
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:00,767
Morpheus!

930
01:23:00,935 --> 01:23:02,185
You must get Neo out!

931
01:23:02,436 --> 01:23:04,270
He's all that matters!

932
01:23:04,563 --> 01:23:06,773
- No, Morpheus! Don't!
- Trinity, go!

933
01:23:07,733 --> 01:23:09,067
Go!

934
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:17,242
- We can't leave him!
- We have to!

935
01:23:41,559 --> 01:23:43,351
Cypher, come on!

936
01:23:48,274 --> 01:23:52,110
The great Morpheus.
We meet at last.

937
01:23:52,653 --> 01:23:53,778
And you are?

938
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:55,780
A Smith.

939
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,323
Agent Smith.

940
01:23:57,908 --> 01:23:59,951
You all look the same to me.

941
01:24:55,591 --> 01:24:56,883
Take him.

942
01:25:03,516 --> 01:25:04,974
No!

943
01:25:10,106 --> 01:25:11,940
- Operator.
- I need an exit, fast.

944
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:16,945
There was an accident.
Goddamn car accident.

945
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:19,072
All of a sudden, boom.

946
01:25:19,323 --> 01:25:20,698
Somebody up there still likes me.

947
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:22,200
I got you.

948
01:25:22,701 --> 01:25:24,619
Just get me out of here fast.

949
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:27,539
Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.
An old TV repair shop.

950
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:28,832
Right.

951
01:25:31,961 --> 01:25:33,545
- Operator.
- Tank, it's me.

952
01:25:33,796 --> 01:25:34,963
Is Morpheus alive?

953
01:25:35,339 --> 01:25:36,631
Is Morpheus alive, Tank?

954
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:38,967
Yes. They're moving him.
I don't know where.

955
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:41,469
He's alive. We need an exit.

956
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:42,804
You're not far from Cypher.

957
01:25:42,972 --> 01:25:44,222
- Cypher?
- I know.

958
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:46,558
- I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
- Got it.

959
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:56,860
Got him.

960
01:26:07,788 --> 01:26:08,830
Where are they?

961
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:10,331
Making the call.

962
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,167
Good.

963
01:26:25,306 --> 01:26:26,556
You first.

964
01:26:29,768 --> 01:26:30,977
Shit!

965
01:26:34,273 --> 01:26:35,940
Tank!

966
01:26:36,108 --> 01:26:37,734
No!

967
01:26:39,653 --> 01:26:41,821
I don't know. It just went dead.

968
01:27:08,641 --> 01:27:09,849
Hello, Trinity.

969
01:27:10,267 --> 01:27:11,601
Cypher? Where's Tank?

970
01:27:17,191 --> 01:27:18,233
You know...

971
01:27:19,944 --> 01:27:22,070
...for a long time...

972
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:26,157
...I thought I was in love with you.

973
01:27:26,951 --> 01:27:28,993
I used to dream about you.

974
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:32,789
You're a beautiful woman, Trinity.

975
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:35,416
Too bad things had to
turn out this way.

976
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:37,001
You killed them.

977
01:27:37,503 --> 01:27:39,003
- What?
- Oh, God.

978
01:27:39,255 --> 01:27:40,672
I'm tired, Trinity.

979
01:27:42,091 --> 01:27:43,967
I'm tired of this war...

980
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:47,095
...tired of fighting.
I'm tired of this ship...

981
01:27:47,429 --> 01:27:52,058
...of being cold, of eating
the same goddamn goop every day.

982
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:55,395
But most of all...

983
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:59,357
...I'm tired of that jack-off
and all of his bullshit.

984
01:28:00,484 --> 01:28:01,776
Surprise, asshole!

985
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:04,529
I bet you never saw this coming...

986
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:05,822
...did you?

987
01:28:08,117 --> 01:28:10,493
God, I wish I could be there...

988
01:28:11,078 --> 01:28:12,578
...when they break you.

989
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:16,791
I wish I could walk in
just when it happens...

990
01:28:17,501 --> 01:28:19,210
...so right then...

991
01:28:19,461 --> 01:28:20,795
...you'd know it was me.

992
01:28:21,297 --> 01:28:22,463
You gave them Morpheus.

993
01:28:22,715 --> 01:28:24,173
He lied to us, Trinity.

994
01:28:24,758 --> 01:28:26,259
He tricked us!

995
01:28:26,802 --> 01:28:28,803
If you had told us the truth...

996
01:28:29,054 --> 01:28:31,931
...we would've told you to shove
that red pill up your ass!

997
01:28:32,182 --> 01:28:34,309
That is not true, Cypher.
He set us free.

998
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,437
"Free. " You call this free?

999
01:28:39,857 --> 01:28:42,358
All I do is what he tells me to do.

1000
01:28:43,944 --> 01:28:46,863
If I had to choose between
that and the Matrix...

1001
01:28:48,032 --> 01:28:49,240
...I choose the Matrix.

1002
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:51,159
The Matrix isn't real.

1003
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:52,827
I disagree, Trinity.

1004
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:55,330
I think the Matrix...

1005
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:58,249
...can be more real than this world.

1006
01:29:00,419 --> 01:29:02,920
All I do is pull the plug here.

1007
01:29:03,297 --> 01:29:04,505
But there...

1008
01:29:05,049 --> 01:29:07,342
...you have to watch Apoc die.

1009
01:29:08,344 --> 01:29:09,594
Trinity.

1010
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,061
- Welcome to the real world.
- But you're out, Cypher.

1011
01:29:18,312 --> 01:29:20,730
- You can't go back.
- That's what you think.

1012
01:29:20,981 --> 01:29:22,482
They'll reinsert my body.

1013
01:29:22,733 --> 01:29:26,361
I go back to sleep. When I wake up,
I won't remember a thing.

1014
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:27,612
By the way...

1015
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:30,823
...if you have anything important
to say to Switch...

1016
01:29:31,325 --> 01:29:32,408
...say it now.

1017
01:29:32,659 --> 01:29:35,703
- No, please don't.
- Not like this.

1018
01:29:37,414 --> 01:29:39,040
Not like this.

1019
01:29:43,504 --> 01:29:44,545
Too late.

1020
01:29:45,297 --> 01:29:46,589
Goddamn you, Cypher!

1021
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:48,716
Don't hate me, Trinity.

1022
01:29:49,093 --> 01:29:50,968
I'm just a messenger.

1023
01:29:51,387 --> 01:29:54,555
And right now,
I'm going to prove it to you.

1024
01:29:55,641 --> 01:29:57,308
If Morpheus was right...

1025
01:29:57,851 --> 01:29:59,727
...there's no way
I can pull this plug.

1026
01:30:00,312 --> 01:30:01,813
If Neo's the One...

1027
01:30:02,314 --> 01:30:04,148
...then there'd have to be...

1028
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,984
...some kind of a miracle to stop me.

1029
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:08,361
Right?

1030
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:11,072
I mean, how can he be the One...

1031
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:12,323
...if he's dead?

1032
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:15,952
You never did answer me before...

1033
01:30:16,245 --> 01:30:18,579
...if you bought into
Morpheus' bullshit.

1034
01:30:18,956 --> 01:30:22,166
Come on. All I want
is a little yes or no.

1035
01:30:23,544 --> 01:30:25,878
Look into his eyes...

1036
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:28,131
...those big, pretty eyes...

1037
01:30:30,884 --> 01:30:32,218
...and tell me...

1038
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:34,178
...yes...

1039
01:30:34,513 --> 01:30:35,888
...or no.

1040
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:38,724
- Yes.
- No!

1041
01:30:38,892 --> 01:30:40,059
I don't believe it.

1042
01:30:41,478 --> 01:30:46,232
Believe it or not, you piece of shit,
you're still going to burn!

1043
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:05,877
You first.

1044
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:16,387
- You're hurt.
- I'll be all right.

1045
01:31:19,183 --> 01:31:20,349
Dozer?

1046
01:31:38,619 --> 01:31:40,995
Have you ever stood and stared at it?

1047
01:31:41,872 --> 01:31:44,999
Marveled at its beauty...

1048
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:47,627
...its genius?

1049
01:31:48,795 --> 01:31:50,671
Billions of people...

1050
01:31:50,923 --> 01:31:53,674
...just living out their lives.

1051
01:31:54,718 --> 01:31:56,385
Oblivious.

1052
01:32:00,974 --> 01:32:03,851
Did you know that the first Matrix...

1053
01:32:04,102 --> 01:32:08,773
...was designed to be a perfect
human world where none suffered...

1054
01:32:09,274 --> 01:32:12,193
...where everyone would be happy.

1055
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:14,237
It was a disaster.

1056
01:32:14,488 --> 01:32:18,824
No one would accept the program.
Entire crops were lost.

1057
01:32:19,701 --> 01:32:21,452
Some believe that...

1058
01:32:21,703 --> 01:32:26,082
...we lacked the programming language
to describe your perfect world.

1059
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:27,875
But I believe that...

1060
01:32:28,043 --> 01:32:29,210
...as a species...

1061
01:32:29,461 --> 01:32:33,297
...human beings define
their reality through misery...

1062
01:32:33,549 --> 01:32:34,924
...and suffering.

1063
01:32:35,175 --> 01:32:37,885
So the perfect world was a dream...

1064
01:32:38,136 --> 01:32:42,974
...that your primitive cerebrum
kept trying to wake up from.

1065
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:47,979
Which is why the Matrix was
redesigned to this.

1066
01:32:48,438 --> 01:32:49,939
The peak...

1067
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:51,607
...of your civilization.

1068
01:32:51,858 --> 01:32:54,110
I say, "your civilization"...

1069
01:32:54,361 --> 01:32:58,489
...because when we started thinking
for you, it became our civilization...

1070
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:01,826
...which is, of course,
what this is all about.

1071
01:33:03,161 --> 01:33:05,746
Evolution, Morpheus.

1072
01:33:06,039 --> 01:33:07,373
Evolution.

1073
01:33:09,668 --> 01:33:11,544
Like the dinosaur.

1074
01:33:13,714 --> 01:33:15,339
Look out that window.

1075
01:33:16,049 --> 01:33:18,175
You had your time.

1076
01:33:18,885 --> 01:33:22,805
The future is our world, Morpheus.

1077
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:25,516
The future is our time.

1078
01:33:29,771 --> 01:33:30,938
There could be a problem.

1079
01:33:31,857 --> 01:33:35,234
- What are they doing to him?
- They're breaking into his mind.

1080
01:33:35,485 --> 01:33:37,653
It's like hacking a computer.
All it takes is time.

1081
01:33:37,904 --> 01:33:39,113
How much time?

1082
01:33:39,364 --> 01:33:42,491
Depends on the mind.
But eventually, it'll crack...

1083
01:33:42,743 --> 01:33:47,163
...and his alpha patterns
will change from this to this.

1084
01:33:47,414 --> 01:33:50,374
When it does, he'll tell them
anything they want to know.

1085
01:33:50,626 --> 01:33:51,667
What do they want?

1086
01:33:51,918 --> 01:33:55,963
The leader of every ship is given
codes to Zion's mainframe computer.

1087
01:33:56,214 --> 01:33:59,133
If an agent got the codes
and got into Zion's mainframe...

1088
01:33:59,384 --> 01:34:02,470
...they could destroy us.
We can't let that happen.

1089
01:34:02,638 --> 01:34:04,889
Trinity, Zion's more important than me...

1090
01:34:05,057 --> 01:34:06,223
...or you...

1091
01:34:06,391 --> 01:34:07,683
...or even Morpheus.

1092
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:13,147
There has to be
something we can do.

1093
01:34:13,565 --> 01:34:15,566
There is. We pull the plug.

1094
01:34:18,654 --> 01:34:20,404
You're going to kill him?

1095
01:34:20,656 --> 01:34:21,822
Kill Morpheus?

1096
01:34:22,449 --> 01:34:24,075
We don't have a choice.

1097
01:34:30,874 --> 01:34:33,793
Never send a human
to do a machine's job.

1098
01:34:34,044 --> 01:34:35,795
If the insider has failed...

1099
01:34:36,046 --> 01:34:39,256
...they'll sever the connection
as soon as possible, unless -

1100
01:34:39,508 --> 01:34:41,217
They're dead. In either case -

1101
01:34:41,468 --> 01:34:45,012
We have no choice. Continue as planned.
Deploy the sentinels.

1102
01:34:45,263 --> 01:34:46,347
Immediately.

1103
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:54,271
Morpheus, you were more
than a leader to us.

1104
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:57,441
You were a father.

1105
01:34:58,985 --> 01:35:00,945
We'll miss you always.

1106
01:35:07,828 --> 01:35:09,036
Stop!

1107
01:35:10,205 --> 01:35:11,539
I don't believe this is happening.

1108
01:35:11,707 --> 01:35:13,749
- Neo, this has to be done.
- Does it?

1109
01:35:14,543 --> 01:35:15,918
I don't know.

1110
01:35:16,253 --> 01:35:18,713
- This can't be just coincidence.
- What?

1111
01:35:18,922 --> 01:35:20,172
The Oracle.

1112
01:35:20,424 --> 01:35:22,216
She told me this would happen.

1113
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:26,804
She told me that I would
have to make a choice.

1114
01:35:27,264 --> 01:35:28,472
What choice?

1115
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:33,978
- What are you doing?
- I'm going in.

1116
01:35:34,312 --> 01:35:36,647
- No, you're not.
- I have to.

1117
01:35:36,857 --> 01:35:40,484
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out.

1118
01:35:40,736 --> 01:35:42,653
There is no way
that you're going back in.

1119
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:46,490
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed I'm something I'm not.

1120
01:35:47,993 --> 01:35:49,034
What?

1121
01:35:49,745 --> 01:35:51,370
I'm not the One, Trinity.

1122
01:35:51,747 --> 01:35:54,707
- The Oracle hit me with that too.
- No, you have to be.

1123
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:57,626
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm just another guy.

1124
01:35:58,295 --> 01:35:59,545
No, Neo, that's not true.

1125
01:36:00,130 --> 01:36:02,757
- It can't be true.
- Why?

1126
01:36:07,179 --> 01:36:10,514
This is loco. They've got Morpheus
in a military-controlled building.

1127
01:36:10,766 --> 01:36:15,144
Even if you somehow got inside, those
are agents holding him. Three of them.

1128
01:36:16,438 --> 01:36:20,357
I want Morpheus back too, but
what you're talking about is suicide.

1129
01:36:20,609 --> 01:36:22,193
That's what it looks like...

1130
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:23,402
...but it's not.

1131
01:36:23,653 --> 01:36:26,030
I can't explain to you why it's not.

1132
01:36:27,115 --> 01:36:30,826
Morpheus believed something, and
he was ready to give his life for it.

1133
01:36:31,077 --> 01:36:34,079
I understand that now.
That's why I have to go.

1134
01:36:34,372 --> 01:36:36,874
- Why?
- Because I believe in something.

1135
01:36:37,042 --> 01:36:38,667
What?

1136
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:41,086
I believe I can bring him back.

1137
01:36:58,063 --> 01:36:59,980
- What are you doing?
- Going with you.

1138
01:37:00,273 --> 01:37:02,274
- No, you're not.
- "No"?

1139
01:37:03,443 --> 01:37:05,569
Let me tell you what I believe.

1140
01:37:06,071 --> 01:37:08,447
Morpheus means more to me
than he does to you.

1141
01:37:08,782 --> 01:37:13,077
I believe if you are serious about
saving him, you will need my help.

1142
01:37:13,328 --> 01:37:15,371
And since I am the ranking officer...

1143
01:37:15,622 --> 01:37:18,499
...if you don't like it,
I believe you can go to hell.

1144
01:37:19,251 --> 01:37:21,669
Because you aren't going anywhere else.

1145
01:37:22,087 --> 01:37:23,629
Tank...

1146
01:37:23,797 --> 01:37:24,922
...load us up.

1147
01:37:34,558 --> 01:37:37,852
I'd like to share
a revelation that I've had...

1148
01:37:38,270 --> 01:37:39,812
...during my time here.

1149
01:37:40,063 --> 01:37:44,066
It came to me when I tried
to classify your species...

1150
01:37:44,317 --> 01:37:46,569
...and I realized...

1151
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:49,113
...that you're not actually mammals.

1152
01:37:51,324 --> 01:37:53,784
Every mammal on this planet...

1153
01:37:54,119 --> 01:37:59,039
...instinctively develops an equilibrium
with the surrounding environment.

1154
01:37:59,291 --> 01:38:01,125
But you humans do not.

1155
01:38:01,668 --> 01:38:05,212
You move to an area
and you multiply...

1156
01:38:05,463 --> 01:38:09,967
...and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed.

1157
01:38:10,302 --> 01:38:12,386
The only way you can survive...

1158
01:38:12,679 --> 01:38:15,639
...is to spread to another area.

1159
01:38:21,062 --> 01:38:23,939
There is another organism
on this planet...

1160
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:26,150
...that follows the same pattern.

1161
01:38:26,776 --> 01:38:28,444
Do you know what it is?

1162
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:30,654
A virus.

1163
01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:35,034
Human beings are a disease.

1164
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:36,952
A cancer of this planet.

1165
01:38:37,203 --> 01:38:39,330
You are a plague.

1166
01:38:39,873 --> 01:38:41,290
And we...

1167
01:38:41,458 --> 01:38:42,833
...are the cure.

1168
01:38:43,835 --> 01:38:45,252
Okay, so what do you need?

1169
01:38:45,879 --> 01:38:47,004
Besides a miracle.

1170
01:38:47,589 --> 01:38:48,797
Guns.

1171
01:38:49,633 --> 01:38:50,841
Lots of guns.

1172
01:39:00,727 --> 01:39:01,936
Neo....

1173
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:06,231
No one has ever done
anything like this.

1174
01:39:07,442 --> 01:39:09,360
That's why it's going to work.

1175
01:39:13,448 --> 01:39:15,366
Why isn't the serum working?

1176
01:39:15,992 --> 01:39:18,285
Perhaps we're asking
the wrong questions.

1177
01:39:20,372 --> 01:39:21,622
Leave me with him.

1178
01:39:24,209 --> 01:39:25,334
Now.

1179
01:39:36,554 --> 01:39:38,138
Hold on, Morpheus.

1180
01:39:38,390 --> 01:39:41,100
They're coming for you.
They're coming.

1181
01:39:43,478 --> 01:39:45,604
Can you hear me, Morpheus?

1182
01:39:45,855 --> 01:39:48,524
I'm going to be honest...

1183
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:50,109
...with you.

1184
01:39:54,489 --> 01:39:55,906
I...

1185
01:39:56,783 --> 01:39:57,908
...hate...

1186
01:39:58,159 --> 01:40:00,119
...this place...

1187
01:40:00,453 --> 01:40:02,746
...this zoo...

1188
01:40:02,998 --> 01:40:04,123
...this prison...

1189
01:40:04,374 --> 01:40:07,543
...this reality,
whatever you want to call it.

1190
01:40:07,794 --> 01:40:10,087
I can't stand it any longer.

1191
01:40:10,839 --> 01:40:12,715
It's the smell.

1192
01:40:14,092 --> 01:40:15,968
If there is such a thing.

1193
01:40:16,302 --> 01:40:19,596
I feel saturated by it.

1194
01:40:21,099 --> 01:40:22,391
I can...

1195
01:40:22,642 --> 01:40:24,184
...taste...

1196
01:40:24,352 --> 01:40:26,395
...your stink.

1197
01:40:26,646 --> 01:40:30,274
And every time I do, I fear that
I have somehow been infected by it.

1198
01:40:30,442 --> 01:40:31,442
It's repulsive.

1199
01:40:32,444 --> 01:40:33,819
Isn't it?

1200
01:40:35,989 --> 01:40:38,282
I must get out of here.

1201
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:40,909
I must get free.

1202
01:40:41,161 --> 01:40:44,038
And in this mind is the key.

1203
01:40:44,289 --> 01:40:45,956
My key.

1204
01:40:46,207 --> 01:40:49,084
Once Zion is destroyed,
there is no need for me to be here.

1205
01:40:49,335 --> 01:40:50,961
Do you understand?

1206
01:40:51,254 --> 01:40:52,629
I need the codes.

1207
01:40:52,881 --> 01:40:55,215
I have to get inside Zion...

1208
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:58,052
...and you have to tell me how.

1209
01:40:58,470 --> 01:41:00,345
You're going to tell me...

1210
01:41:00,597 --> 01:41:02,765
...or you're going to die.

1211
01:41:22,952 --> 01:41:26,080
Please remove any metallic items
you're carrying. Keys, loose change.

1212
01:41:30,001 --> 01:41:31,043
Holy shit!

1213
01:41:43,139 --> 01:41:45,849
Backup. Send backup.

1214
01:42:09,666 --> 01:42:10,791
Freeze!

1215
01:44:25,635 --> 01:44:26,843
What were you doing?

1216
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:29,972
He doesn't know.

1217
01:44:30,223 --> 01:44:31,723
Know what?

1218
01:44:59,794 --> 01:45:02,296
I think they're trying to save him.

1219
01:45:17,145 --> 01:45:18,895
There is no spoon.

1220
01:45:48,509 --> 01:45:50,677
Find them and destroy them!

1221
01:45:52,305 --> 01:45:54,139
We're under attack!

1222
01:46:26,255 --> 01:46:27,422
Trinity!

1223
01:46:27,924 --> 01:46:29,007
Help!

1224
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:52,239
Only human.

1225
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:54,282
Dodge this.

1226
01:47:07,505 --> 01:47:09,005
- How did you do that?
- Do what?

1227
01:47:09,424 --> 01:47:13,343
You moved like they do.
I've never seen anyone move that fast.

1228
01:47:14,470 --> 01:47:15,846
It wasn't fast enough.

1229
01:47:18,599 --> 01:47:19,891
Can you fly that thing?

1230
01:47:21,018 --> 01:47:22,018
Not yet.

1231
01:47:25,314 --> 01:47:26,356
Operator.

1232
01:47:26,566 --> 01:47:29,734
I need a pilot program
for a B-212 helicopter.

1233
01:47:30,194 --> 01:47:31,486
Hurry.

1234
01:47:39,412 --> 01:47:41,037
Let's go.

1235
01:47:56,137 --> 01:47:57,220
No.

1236
01:48:48,814 --> 01:48:51,441
Morpheus, get up.
Get up, get up.

1237
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:30,522
He's not going to make it.

1238
01:49:40,324 --> 01:49:41,366
Got you.

1239
01:50:47,433 --> 01:50:48,600
Trinity!

1240
01:51:30,267 --> 01:51:31,685
I knew it.

1241
01:51:32,311 --> 01:51:33,520
He's the One.

1242
01:51:49,495 --> 01:51:51,705
Do you believe it now, Trinity?

1243
01:51:54,583 --> 01:51:55,750
Morpheus....

1244
01:51:57,420 --> 01:51:58,503
The Oracle.

1245
01:51:59,755 --> 01:52:02,132
- She told me -
- She told you...

1246
01:52:02,508 --> 01:52:04,092
...what you needed to hear.

1247
01:52:04,385 --> 01:52:05,719
That's all.

1248
01:52:06,762 --> 01:52:09,723
Sooner or later you'll realize,
just as I did...

1249
01:52:10,057 --> 01:52:12,350
...there's a difference
between knowing the path...

1250
01:52:13,102 --> 01:52:14,394
...and walking the path.

1251
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:18,648
- Operator.
- Tank.

1252
01:52:19,567 --> 01:52:22,110
- It's good to hear your voice.
- We need an exit.

1253
01:52:22,361 --> 01:52:25,155
Got one ready. Subway station,
State and Balboa.

1254
01:52:38,210 --> 01:52:40,628
- Damn it!
- The trace was completed.

1255
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:44,466
- We have their position.
- Sentinels are standing by.

1256
01:52:46,177 --> 01:52:47,677
Order the strike.

1257
01:52:54,226 --> 01:52:56,227
They're not out yet.

1258
01:53:07,406 --> 01:53:08,740
You first, Morpheus.

1259
01:53:29,428 --> 01:53:31,721
Neo, I want to tell you something...

1260
01:53:34,975 --> 01:53:38,937
...but I'm afraid of
what it could mean if I do.

1261
01:53:42,525 --> 01:53:45,819
Everything the Oracle
told me has come true.

1262
01:53:48,572 --> 01:53:50,114
Everything but this.

1263
01:53:51,617 --> 01:53:52,659
But what?

1264
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:18,726
Neo!

1265
01:54:18,978 --> 01:54:20,603
- What happened?
- An agent.

1266
01:54:20,855 --> 01:54:22,772
- Send me back.
- I can't.

1267
01:54:24,817 --> 01:54:26,776
Mr. Anderson.

1268
01:54:28,988 --> 01:54:30,363
Run, Neo. Run.

1269
01:54:35,661 --> 01:54:37,287
What is he doing?

1270
01:54:37,538 --> 01:54:38,788
He's beginning to believe.

1271
01:55:05,774 --> 01:55:07,150
You're empty.

1272
01:55:07,735 --> 01:55:09,027
So are you.

1273
01:55:42,186 --> 01:55:45,188
I'm going to enjoy watching you die...

1274
01:55:46,315 --> 01:55:47,357
...Mr. Anderson.

1275
01:56:28,315 --> 01:56:30,400
Jesus, he's killing him.

1276
01:57:56,570 --> 01:57:58,696
You hear that, Mr. Anderson?

1277
01:57:59,448 --> 01:58:02,450
That is the sound of inevitability.

1278
01:58:05,037 --> 01:58:08,372
It is the sound of your death.

1279
01:58:09,291 --> 01:58:11,626
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1280
01:58:11,877 --> 01:58:13,503
My name...

1281
01:58:16,507 --> 01:58:18,549
...is Neo.

1282
01:58:50,791 --> 01:58:53,000
- What happened?
- I don't know. I lost him.

1283
01:58:55,504 --> 01:58:56,546
Oh, shit.

1284
01:59:08,934 --> 01:59:10,393
Sentinels.

1285
01:59:11,145 --> 01:59:13,396
- How long?
- Five, maybe six minutes.

1286
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:17,608
Tank, charge the EMP.

1287
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:20,903
- We can't use that until he's out.
- I know. Don't worry.

1288
01:59:22,072 --> 01:59:23,156
He's gonna make it.

1289
01:59:23,407 --> 01:59:25,283
Flat or pumps? No, just -

1290
01:59:25,534 --> 01:59:28,411
What the shit? That's my phone!

1291
01:59:28,829 --> 01:59:30,413
That guy took my phone!

1292
01:59:32,791 --> 01:59:35,084
Got him!
He's on the run.

1293
01:59:35,335 --> 01:59:38,004
Mr. Wizard, get me out of here!

1294
01:59:38,255 --> 01:59:40,131
I got an old exit.
Wabash and Lake.

1295
01:59:44,094 --> 01:59:45,094
Oh, shit!

1296
02:00:06,658 --> 02:00:08,659
Help! Need a little help!

1297
02:00:10,287 --> 02:00:11,495
The door.

1298
02:00:27,471 --> 02:00:28,971
The door on your left.

1299
02:00:29,890 --> 02:00:31,140
Your other left!

1300
02:00:37,856 --> 02:00:39,106
The back door.

1301
02:00:59,878 --> 02:01:01,003
Oh, no.

1302
02:01:02,673 --> 02:01:04,173
Here they come.

1303
02:01:32,953 --> 02:01:34,203
He's going to make it.

1304
02:01:44,423 --> 02:01:47,550
The fire escape at the end
of the alley, room 303.

1305
02:02:22,669 --> 02:02:23,753
They're inside.

1306
02:02:26,089 --> 02:02:27,131
Hurry, Neo.

1307
02:03:23,355 --> 02:03:24,480
It can't be.

1308
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:33,656
Check him.

1309
02:03:37,661 --> 02:03:39,203
He's gone.

1310
02:03:45,919 --> 02:03:48,337
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1311
02:03:55,929 --> 02:03:56,971
Neo....

1312
02:03:58,432 --> 02:04:00,391
I'm not afraid anymore.

1313
02:04:02,018 --> 02:04:03,352
The Oracle told me...

1314
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:08,941
...I'd fall in love, and that
the man I loved would be the One.

1315
02:04:12,070 --> 02:04:14,029
So you see...

1316
02:04:14,739 --> 02:04:16,740
...you can't be dead.

1317
02:04:18,326 --> 02:04:20,161
You can't be...

1318
02:04:21,705 --> 02:04:23,873
...because I love you.

1319
02:04:25,709 --> 02:04:27,418
You hear me?

1320
02:04:28,545 --> 02:04:30,212
I love you.

1321
02:04:53,945 --> 02:04:55,237
Now, get up.

1322
02:05:03,914 --> 02:05:05,080
No.

1323
02:05:31,816 --> 02:05:32,858
How?

1324
02:05:33,735 --> 02:05:34,777
He is the One.

1325
02:07:01,531 --> 02:07:02,990
Neo!

1326
02:07:59,255 --> 02:08:00,964
I know you're out there.

1327
02:08:01,216 --> 02:08:03,050
I can feel you now.

1328
02:08:03,468 --> 02:08:07,096
I know that you're afraid.
You're afraid of us.

1329
02:08:07,430 --> 02:08:09,264
You're afraid of change.

1330
02:08:10,725 --> 02:08:12,059
I don't know the future.

1331
02:08:12,227 --> 02:08:14,812
I didn't come here to tell you
how this is going to end.

1332
02:08:15,063 --> 02:08:18,023
I came here to tell you
how it's going to begin.

1333
02:08:18,983 --> 02:08:20,567
I'll hang up this phone.

1334
02:08:20,819 --> 02:08:23,904
And then I'll show these people
what you don't want them to see.

1335
02:08:24,155 --> 02:08:26,031
I'm going to show them a world...

1336
02:08:26,282 --> 02:08:28,033
...without you.

1337
02:08:28,326 --> 02:08:31,954
A world without rules and controls,
without borders or boundaries.

1338
02:08:32,205 --> 02:08:35,916
A world where anything is possible.

1339
02:08:38,545 --> 02:08:39,878
Where we go from there...

1340
02:08:40,130 --> 02:08:42,089
...is a choice I leave to you.
