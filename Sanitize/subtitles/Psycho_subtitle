1
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,490
You never did eat your lunch,
did you?

2
00:03:15,577 --> 00:03:18,706
I better get back to the office.
These extended lunch hours...

3
00:03:18,793 --> 00:03:20,705
give my boss excess acid.

4
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:22,661
Why don't you call your boss
and tell him...

5
00:03:22,747 --> 00:03:24,964
you're taking the rest
of the afternoon off?

6
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,441
It's Friday anyway,
and hot.

7
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:32,351
What do I do with my free afternoon?
Walk you to the airport?

8
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,916
Well, we could laze
around here a while longer.

9
00:03:35,002 --> 00:03:38,870
Checking-out time is 3:00 p. m.

10
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:42,347
Hotels of this sort aren't
interested in you when you come in...

11
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:44,824
but when your time is up...

12
00:03:44,911 --> 00:03:47,648
Oh, Sam, I hate having to be with you
in a place like this.

13
00:03:47,735 --> 00:03:49,648
I've heard of married couples who
deliberately spend a night...

14
00:03:49,734 --> 00:03:51,473
in a cheap hotel.

15
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:55,471
When you're married you can do
a lot of things deliberately.

16
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:58,208
You sure talk like
a girl who's been married.

17
00:03:58,295 --> 00:04:01,337
Oh, Sam, this is
the last time.

18
00:04:01,424 --> 00:04:04,944
- Yeah? For what?
- For this.

19
00:04:05,074 --> 00:04:08,725
For meeting you in secret
so we can be secretive.

20
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:11,593
You come down here
on business trips...

21
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,983
and we steal lunch hours.

22
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,112
I wish you
wouldn't even come.

23
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,806
What do we do instead?
Write each other lurid love letters?

24
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,109
Oh, I have to go, Sam.

25
00:04:25,369 --> 00:04:28,541
- I can come down next week.
- No.

26
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:33,713
Not even just to see you?
Have lunch in public?

27
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,972
Oh, we can see each other.
We can even have dinner.

28
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:39,971
But respectably.

29
00:04:40,057 --> 00:04:42,882
In my house with my mother's
picture on the mantel and...

30
00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:46,663
my sister helping me broil
a big steak for three.

31
00:04:46,793 --> 00:04:49,053
And after the steak, do we
send sister to the movies...

32
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,052
turn Mama's picture to the wall?

33
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:53,181
Sam!

34
00:04:55,397 --> 00:04:57,527
All right.

35
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:06,218
Marion, whenever it's possible,
I want to see you.

36
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:10,825
And under any circumstances,
even respectability.

37
00:05:10,912 --> 00:05:14,215
You make respectability
sound disrespectful.

38
00:05:14,301 --> 00:05:19,604
I'm all for it. It requires patience,
temperance, a lot of sweating out.

39
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,949
Otherwise, though,
it's just hard work.

40
00:05:24,036 --> 00:05:29,077
But if I can see you and touch you
even as simply as this, I won't mind it.

41
00:05:31,424 --> 00:05:33,857
I'm tired of sweating
for people who aren't there.

42
00:05:33,945 --> 00:05:36,855
I sweat to pay off my father's
debts, and he's in his grave.

43
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:39,898
I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony,
and she's living...

44
00:05:39,984 --> 00:05:41,593
on the other side of the world somewhere.

45
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:44,505
I pay too.

46
00:05:46,156 --> 00:05:48,676
They also pay
who meet in hotel rooms.

47
00:05:50,414 --> 00:05:54,064
A couple of years and
my debts will be paid off.

48
00:05:54,152 --> 00:05:56,238
If she ever remarries,
the alimony stops.

49
00:05:56,325 --> 00:06:00,931
- I haven't even been married once yet.
- But when you do, you'll swing.

50
00:06:01,018 --> 00:06:03,973
Oh, Sam, let's get married.

51
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:12,707
And live with me in a storeroom
behind a hardware store in Fairvale?

52
00:06:12,795 --> 00:06:15,315
We'll have lots of laughs.
I'll tell you what.

53
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:19,053
When I send my ex-wife her alimony,
you can lick the stamps.

54
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,877
I'll lick the stamps.

55
00:06:29,134 --> 00:06:34,437
You want to cut this off, go out
and find yourself somebody available?

56
00:06:34,523 --> 00:06:36,914
I'm thinking of it.

57
00:06:40,043 --> 00:06:43,475
How could you even
think a thing like that?

58
00:06:43,563 --> 00:06:46,300
- Don't miss your plane.
- We can leave together, can't we?

59
00:06:46,387 --> 00:06:50,212
Mm-mm. I'm late and, uh,
you have to put your shoes on.

60
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:05,508
Isn't Mr Lowery
back from lunch?

61
00:07:05,595 --> 00:07:08,506
He's lunching with the man who's
buying the Harris Street property.

62
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:12,026
The old lease man. That's why
he's late. You got a headache?

63
00:07:12,114 --> 00:07:15,025
It'll pass.
Headaches are like resolutions...

64
00:07:15,112 --> 00:07:17,632
you forget them
as soon as they stop hurting.

65
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,631
Have you got some aspirin?
I've got something, not aspirin.

66
00:07:20,718 --> 00:07:23,543
My mother's doctor gave them to me
the day of my wedding.

67
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:26,672
Teddy was furious when he found out
I'd taken tranquillizers.

68
00:07:26,758 --> 00:07:28,844
Any calls?

69
00:07:28,932 --> 00:07:33,234
Teddy called me. My mother
called to see if Teddy called.

70
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:36,580
Oh, your sister called to say she's
going to Tucson to do some buying...

71
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,927
- and she'll be gone the whole weekend...

72
00:07:41,925 --> 00:07:46,662
Wow. It's as hot
as fresh milk.

73
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:51,398
Hey, you girls oughta get your boss
to air condition ya up.

74
00:07:51,486 --> 00:07:53,572
He can afford it today.

75
00:07:53,658 --> 00:07:56,701
Marion, will you get the copies
of that deed ready for Mr Cassidy?

76
00:07:56,787 --> 00:08:00,698
- Yes, sir.
- Tomorrow's the day, my sweet little girl.

77
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:04,132
Oh... Oh, not you.
My daughter.

78
00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:06,565
A baby.

79
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:11,519
Tomorrow she stands her sweet self
up there and gets married away from me.

80
00:08:11,606 --> 00:08:16,473
- I want you to take a look at my baby.

81
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:19,950
Eighteen years old...

82
00:08:20,037 --> 00:08:24,687
and she never had an unhappy day
in any one of those years.

83
00:08:24,817 --> 00:08:27,902
Come on, Tom.
My office is air conditioned.

84
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,510
Do you know what I do
about unhappiness?

85
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:33,117
I buy it off.

86
00:08:33,205 --> 00:08:35,594
Are, uh...
Are you unhappy?

87
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,636
Uh, not inordinately.

88
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:45,242
I'm buying this house
for my baby's wedding present.

89
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:47,937
Forty thousand
dollars cash.

90
00:08:49,501 --> 00:08:51,891
Now that's...
that's not buying happiness.

91
00:08:51,978 --> 00:08:55,411
That's just buying off unhappiness.

92
00:08:57,193 --> 00:09:00,713
I never carry more than
I can afford to lose.

93
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,146
- Count 'em!
- I declare!

94
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:06,753
I don't. That's how
I get to keep it.

95
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,012
Tom, a cash transaction
of this size is most irregular.

96
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:13,793
Ah, so what?
It's my private money.

97
00:09:13,837 --> 00:09:17,096
- Now it's yours.
- Suppose we put it in the safe...

98
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:20,572
and then Monday morning
when you're feeling good...

99
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,700
Oh, speaking of feeling good, where's
that bottle you said was in your desk?

100
00:09:25,787 --> 00:09:29,742
Uh-oh.

101
00:09:29,828 --> 00:09:34,435
You know, uh, sometimes
I can keep my mouth shut.

102
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,866
Lowery, I am dying
of "thirst-aroonie. "

103
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,211
I don't even want it in
the office over the weekend.

104
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:53,209
Put it in the safe deposit box in the
bank, and we'll get a cheque on Monday.

105
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:55,816
Yes.

106
00:09:59,727 --> 00:10:04,290
He was flirting with you. I guess
he must've noticed my wedding ring.

107
00:10:17,588 --> 00:10:19,544
Come in.

108
00:10:21,499 --> 00:10:25,324
The copies. If you don't mind,
I'd like to go home after the bank.

109
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,713
- I have a slight...
- You go right on home.

110
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:30,756
Because me and your boss are goin' out
and get ourselves...

111
00:10:30,842 --> 00:10:32,755
a little drinkin' done, right?

112
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,579
- Of course. Do you feel ill?
- Just a headache.

113
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:40,229
What you need is a weekend in Las Vegas,
the playground of the world.

114
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:42,576
I'm going to spend this weekend
in bed. Thank you.

115
00:10:45,313 --> 00:10:49,790
Aren't you going to take the pills?
They'll knock that headache out.

116
00:10:49,876 --> 00:10:53,266
Can't buy off unhappiness
with pills.

117
00:10:53,354 --> 00:10:58,220
I guess I'll go put this money in the
bank and then go home and sleep it off.

118
00:13:00,465 --> 00:13:03,767
Marion, what in
the world... What are you doing up here?

119
00:13:03,855 --> 00:13:06,593
Of course I'm glad to see you.
I always am.

120
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:10,590
What is it, Marion?

121
00:14:46,848 --> 00:14:49,803
- Uh, hold it there.

122
00:14:54,974 --> 00:14:57,408
In quite a hurry.

123
00:14:57,495 --> 00:15:02,970
I didn't intend to sleep so long. I
almost had an accident from sleepiness.

124
00:15:03,057 --> 00:15:06,707
- So, I decided to pull over.
- You slept here all night?

125
00:15:06,795 --> 00:15:10,662
Yes. As I said,
I couldn't keep my eyes open.

126
00:15:10,749 --> 00:15:14,182
There are plenty of motels
in this area. You should've...

127
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:16,442
I mean, just to be safe.

128
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:19,441
I didn't intend to sleep all night.
I just pulled over.

129
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:21,527
Have I broken any laws?

130
00:15:21,613 --> 00:15:23,830
- No, ma'am.
- Then I'm free to go?

131
00:15:25,264 --> 00:15:28,045
Is anything wrong?

132
00:15:28,132 --> 00:15:31,782
Of course not. Am I acting
as if there's something wrong?

133
00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:36,823
- Frankly, yes.
- Please, I'd like to go.

134
00:15:36,911 --> 00:15:39,605
- Well, is there?
- Is there what?

135
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:44,819
I've told you there's nothing wrong,
except I'm in a hurry...

136
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,819
and you're taking up my time.

137
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:48,817
- Now, just a moment.

138
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:52,425
- Turn your motor off, please.

139
00:15:52,511 --> 00:15:55,379
May I see your licence?

140
00:15:58,117 --> 00:16:01,029
- Why?
- Please.

141
00:18:06,576 --> 00:18:09,227
Be with you
in a second!

142
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:14,934
- I'm in no mood for trouble.
- What?

143
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:18,063
There's an old saying: "First customer
of the day is always the most trouble. "

144
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,062
But I'm in no mood for it...

145
00:19:20,148 --> 00:19:22,626
so I'm gonna treat you so fair
you won't have one reason...

146
00:19:22,713 --> 00:19:26,276
- Can I trade my car and take another?
- Do anything you have a mind to.

147
00:19:26,364 --> 00:19:29,274
Bein' a woman, you will.
That yours?

148
00:19:29,362 --> 00:19:32,100
Yes, it's, it's... There's
nothing wrong with it. I just...

149
00:19:32,186 --> 00:19:34,098
Sick of the sight of it.

150
00:19:34,186 --> 00:19:37,706
Have a look around and see if there's
something that strikes your eyes...

151
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:40,053
and I'll have my mechanic
give yours the once-over.

152
00:19:40,139 --> 00:19:41,920
- You want some coffee?
- No, thank you. I'm in a hurry...

153
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:43,746
and just wanna make a change.

154
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,614
One thing people never oughta be
when they're buyin' used cars...

155
00:19:46,701 --> 00:19:49,570
and that's in a hurry, but like I said,
it's too nice a day to argue.

156
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:52,350
I'll shoot your car
in the garage here.

157
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,253
That's the one I'd have
picked for you myself.

158
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,990
- How much?
- Go ahead.

159
00:20:17,078 --> 00:20:18,729
- Spin it around the block.
- It looks fine.

160
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,728
How much would it be
with my car?

161
00:20:20,815 --> 00:20:23,988
You mean you don't want the usual day
and a half to think it over?

162
00:20:24,074 --> 00:20:28,463
You are in a hurry, aren't you?
Somebody chasin' ya?

163
00:20:28,551 --> 00:20:30,462
Of course not.
Please.

164
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:36,416
Well, it's the first time the customer
ever high pressured the salesman.

165
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:40,979
Ah, I figure roughly...

166
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:44,065
your car plus $700.

167
00:20:44,151 --> 00:20:48,540
- Seven hundred.
- You always got time to argue money.

168
00:20:48,628 --> 00:20:50,670
All right.

169
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:57,754
I take it you can prove
that car is yours.

170
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,013
I mean, out-of-state licence.
You got your pink slip...

171
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:04,315
I believe I have the necessary papers.
Is there a ladies room?

172
00:21:04,403 --> 00:21:07,183
In the building.

173
00:21:17,657 --> 00:21:19,829
Over there.

174
00:22:16,193 --> 00:22:18,844
I think you better take it
for a trial spin.

175
00:22:18,931 --> 00:22:21,625
I don't want any bad word of mouth
about California Charlie.

176
00:22:21,713 --> 00:22:24,624
I'd really rather not.
Can't we just settle this...

177
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:29,013
I might as well be perfectly honest with
you. It's not that I don't trust you...

178
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,533
But what? Is there
anything so terribly wrong...

179
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,141
about making a decision
and wanting to hurry?

180
00:22:35,227 --> 00:22:38,530
- Do you think I've stolen my car?
- No, ma'am.

181
00:22:38,617 --> 00:22:42,137
All right,
let's go inside.

182
00:23:18,424 --> 00:23:20,336
Hey!

183
00:23:26,985 --> 00:23:29,983
Just put it in here, please.

184
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,329
Thank you.

185
00:23:41,847 --> 00:23:44,759
Heck,
Officer, that was the first time...

186
00:23:44,845 --> 00:23:47,627
I saw the customer
high pressure the salesman.

187
00:23:47,714 --> 00:23:49,625
Somebody chasin' her?

188
00:23:49,713 --> 00:23:52,624
I better have
a look at those papers, Charlie.

189
00:23:52,712 --> 00:23:56,926
- She look like a wrong one to you?
- Acted like one.

190
00:23:57,014 --> 00:24:01,186
The only funny thing,
she paid me $700 in cash.

191
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:11,441
Yes, Mr Lowery.

192
00:24:11,528 --> 00:24:13,788
Caroline. Marion still isn't in?

193
00:24:13,918 --> 00:24:17,569
No, Mr. Lowery, but then she's always
a bit late on Monday mornings.

194
00:24:17,655 --> 00:24:21,089
Buzz me the minute
she comes in.

195
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:24,478
And call her sister.
No one's answering at the house.

196
00:24:24,565 --> 00:24:28,955
I called her sister where she works...
The Music Makers Music Store...

197
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:31,779
and she doesn't know where Marion
is any more than we do.

198
00:24:31,866 --> 00:24:35,646
You better run out to the house. She may
be, well, unable to answer the phone.

199
00:24:35,734 --> 00:24:38,993
Her sister's going to do that.
She's as worried as we are.

200
00:24:42,383 --> 00:24:45,077
No, I haven't the faintest idea.

201
00:24:45,207 --> 00:24:48,162
As I said, I last saw your sister
when she left this office on Friday.

202
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,812
She said she didn't feel well and wanted
to leave early, and I said she could.

203
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,594
That was the last I saw...
Oh, wait a minute.

204
00:24:54,681 --> 00:24:57,984
I did see her
some time later driving...

205
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:02,156
Uh, I think you'd better come
over here to my office, quick.

206
00:25:02,242 --> 00:25:05,154
Caroline,
get Mr Cassidy for me.

207
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,412
After all, Cassidy,
I told you, all that cash!

208
00:25:11,498 --> 00:25:13,845
I'm not taking
the responsibility.

209
00:25:13,933 --> 00:25:18,408
Oh, for heaven's sake. A girl works
for you for ten years, you trust her.

210
00:25:18,496 --> 00:25:20,407
All right, yes,
you better come over.

211
00:25:22,493 --> 00:25:26,013
Well, I ain't
about to kiss off $40,000!

212
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,143
I'll get it back, and if any of it's
missin', I'll replace it...

213
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,141
with her fine, soft flesh!

214
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:33,184
- I'll track her, never you doubt it.
- Hold on, Cassidy.

215
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:38,485
I still can't believe... It must be
some kind of a mystery. I, I can't...

216
00:25:38,573 --> 00:25:41,832
You checked with the bank, no?
They never laid eyes on her, no?

217
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,047
You still trustin'? Hot creepers!
She sat there while I dumped it out!

218
00:25:46,134 --> 00:25:50,870
Hardly even looked at it. Plannin'.
And, and even flirtin' with me!

219
00:28:15,887 --> 00:28:21,058
Gee, I'm sorry I didn't hear you
in all this rain. Go ahead in, please.

220
00:28:25,969 --> 00:28:28,533
- Dirty night.
- Do you have a vacancy?

221
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:32,879
Oh, we have 12 vacancies.
12 cabins, 12 vacancies.

222
00:28:32,965 --> 00:28:36,269
They, uh... They moved
away the highway.

223
00:28:36,355 --> 00:28:40,180
Oh, I thought I'd gotten
off the main road.

224
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:45,437
I knew you must have. Nobody ever stops
here any more unless they've done that.

225
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:49,436
But... there's no sense
dwelling on our losses.

226
00:28:49,523 --> 00:28:53,738
We just keep on lighting the lights
and following the formalities.

227
00:28:57,171 --> 00:29:01,126
Your home address.
Oh, just the town will do.

228
00:29:03,863 --> 00:29:06,775
Los Angeles.

229
00:29:12,903 --> 00:29:17,639
Cabin one. It's closer in case you want
anything. It's right next to the office.

230
00:29:17,727 --> 00:29:20,551
I want sleep more than anything else,
except maybe food.

231
00:29:20,637 --> 00:29:24,027
There's a big diner about ten miles
up the road, just outside of Fairvale.

232
00:29:24,115 --> 00:29:28,808
- Am I that close to Fairvale?
- Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.

233
00:29:47,885 --> 00:29:50,189
Boy, it's stuffy in here.

234
00:29:55,621 --> 00:29:58,533
Well, the, uh, mattress
is soft and...

235
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:00,879
there's hangers in the closet
and stationary...

236
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,878
with "Bates Motel"
printed on it...

237
00:30:02,965 --> 00:30:06,658
in case you wanna make your
friends back home feel envious.

238
00:30:06,746 --> 00:30:08,702
And the, uh...

239
00:30:10,092 --> 00:30:12,786
- Over there.
- The bathroom.

240
00:30:12,873 --> 00:30:15,220
Yeah.

241
00:30:15,307 --> 00:30:19,609
Well, uh, i-i-if you want anything,
just... just tap on the wall.

242
00:30:19,696 --> 00:30:21,608
- I'll be in the office.
- Thank you, Mr Bates.

243
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:24,172
Norman Bates.

244
00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:30,082
You're not really gonna go out again
and drive up to the diner, are you?

245
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:32,560
- No.
- Then would you do me a favour?

246
00:30:32,646 --> 00:30:34,385
Would you have dinner with me?

247
00:30:34,471 --> 00:30:38,948
I was just about to myself. Nothing
special... just sandwiches and milk.

248
00:30:39,034 --> 00:30:42,728
But I'd like it very much
if you'd come up to the house.

249
00:30:42,859 --> 00:30:46,205
I don't set a fancy table,
but the kitchen's awful homey.

250
00:30:47,986 --> 00:30:49,942
- I'd like to.
- All right.

251
00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:52,723
You get yourself settled and,
and take off your wet shoes.

252
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:56,243
- I'll be back as soon as it's ready.
- Okay.

253
00:30:56,374 --> 00:30:59,937
- With my... With my trusty umbrella.

254
00:32:19,811 --> 00:32:22,896
No! I tell you no!

255
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:25,982
I won't have you bringing strange
young girls in for supper!

256
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:29,936
By candlelight, I suppose,
in the cheap, erotic fashion...

257
00:32:30,024 --> 00:32:33,630
- of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
- Mother, please.

258
00:32:33,717 --> 00:32:37,064
And then what, after supper?
Music? Whispers?

259
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:40,279
Mother, she's just a stranger.
She's hungry and it's raining out.

260
00:32:40,366 --> 00:32:45,841
"Mother, she's just a stranger. " As if
men don't desire strangers. As if...

261
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:50,492
Oh! I refuse to speak of disgusting
things, because they disgust me!

262
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:52,795
Do you understand, boy?
Go on.

263
00:32:52,882 --> 00:32:55,924
Go tell her she'll not be
appeasing her ugly appetite...

264
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,662
with my food or my son!

265
00:32:58,748 --> 00:33:01,704
Or do I have to tell her
'cause you don't have the guts?

266
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:06,310
- Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
- Shut up! Shut up!

267
00:33:47,637 --> 00:33:51,636
- I've caused you some trouble.
- No, uh...

268
00:33:51,723 --> 00:33:54,635
Mother...
My mother, uh...

269
00:33:54,721 --> 00:33:57,372
What is the phrase?

270
00:33:57,459 --> 00:34:00,674
She isn't quite
herself today.

271
00:34:00,762 --> 00:34:06,020
You shouldn't have bothered. I really
don't have that much of an appetite.

272
00:34:06,107 --> 00:34:08,757
Oh, I'm sorry.

273
00:34:10,496 --> 00:34:14,190
I wish you could apologize
for other people.

274
00:34:14,277 --> 00:34:16,189
Don't worry about it.

275
00:34:16,276 --> 00:34:20,187
But as long as you've fixed
the supper, we may as well eat it.

276
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:34,528
It, uh... It might be, uh, nicer
and warmer in the office.

277
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:50,259
Well, it stopped
raining.

278
00:34:50,346 --> 00:34:54,301
Uh, eating in an office
is just... just too officious.

279
00:34:54,387 --> 00:34:57,343
- I have the parlour back here.
- All right.

280
00:35:12,162 --> 00:35:15,725
- Sit down.
- Oh, thank you.

281
00:35:18,636 --> 00:35:21,939
You're very kind.

282
00:35:22,026 --> 00:35:25,764
It's all for you.
I'm not hungry. Go ahead.

283
00:35:31,152 --> 00:35:33,456
You... You eat like a bird.

284
00:35:35,063 --> 00:35:38,019
And you'd know,
of course.

285
00:35:38,105 --> 00:35:40,017
No, not really.

286
00:35:40,148 --> 00:35:43,581
Anyway, I hear the expression
"Eats like a bird"...

287
00:35:43,668 --> 00:35:48,144
is really a fal...
false... falsity.

288
00:35:48,231 --> 00:35:51,881
Because birds really
eat a tremendous lot.

289
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:58,791
But I really don't know anything about
birds. My hobby is stuffing things.

290
00:35:58,878 --> 00:36:00,790
You know, taxidermy.

291
00:36:00,877 --> 00:36:05,397
And I guess I'd just rather
stuff birds because...

292
00:36:05,483 --> 00:36:07,874
I hate the look of beasts
when they're stuffed.

293
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,960
You know,
foxes and chimps.

294
00:36:10,046 --> 00:36:14,174
Some people even stuff dogs and cats,
but, oh, I can't do that.

295
00:36:14,262 --> 00:36:17,608
I think only birds
look well stuffed because...

296
00:36:17,738 --> 00:36:21,389
Well, because they're kind
of passive to begin with.

297
00:36:21,475 --> 00:36:24,343
It's a strange hobby.
Curious.

298
00:36:24,431 --> 00:36:27,951
- Uncommon too.
- Oh, I imagine so.

299
00:36:28,081 --> 00:36:31,818
And it's... it's not as expensive
as you'd think. It's cheap, really.

300
00:36:31,905 --> 00:36:34,600
You know, needles
and thread, sawdust.

301
00:36:34,686 --> 00:36:37,163
The chemicals are the only
thing that, that cost anything.

302
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:40,206
A man should have a hobby.

303
00:36:40,292 --> 00:36:44,204
Well, it's...
it's more than a hobby.

304
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:49,549
A hobby's supposed to
pass the time, not fill it.

305
00:36:49,635 --> 00:36:52,547
Is your time so empty?

306
00:36:52,634 --> 00:36:55,241
No. Uh...

307
00:36:55,329 --> 00:36:57,458
Well, I run the office...

308
00:36:57,545 --> 00:36:59,892
and tend the cabins
and grounds...

309
00:36:59,978 --> 00:37:02,803
and do little, uh,
errands for my mother...

310
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:05,671
the ones she allows
I might be capable of doing.

311
00:37:05,759 --> 00:37:08,887
Do you go out with friends?

312
00:37:10,843 --> 00:37:13,754
Well, a boy's best friend
is his mother.

313
00:37:16,188 --> 00:37:20,707
You've never had an empty moment
in your entire life, have you?

314
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,531
- Only my share.
- Where are you going?

315
00:37:27,617 --> 00:37:30,094
I didn't mean to pry.

316
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:32,876
I'm looking for
a private island.

317
00:37:35,004 --> 00:37:37,873
What are you
running away from?

318
00:37:39,785 --> 00:37:43,739
- Why do you ask that?
- No.

319
00:37:43,827 --> 00:37:46,216
People never run away
from anything.

320
00:37:49,042 --> 00:37:52,996
The rain didn't last long,
did it? You know what I think?

321
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:55,647
I think that...

322
00:37:57,516 --> 00:37:59,645
we're all in
our private traps...

323
00:38:01,253 --> 00:38:05,034
clamped in them, and none of us
can ever get out.

324
00:38:06,859 --> 00:38:09,031
We scratch and...
and claw...

325
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,030
but only at the air,
only at each other.

326
00:38:13,117 --> 00:38:17,984
And for all of it,
we never budge an inch.

327
00:38:18,071 --> 00:38:20,548
Sometimes we deliberately
step into those traps.

328
00:38:23,763 --> 00:38:26,154
I was born in mine.
I don't mind it any more.

329
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,630
Oh, but you should.
You should mind it.

330
00:38:29,717 --> 00:38:32,151
Oh, I do, but I say I don't.

331
00:38:35,193 --> 00:38:39,408
You know, if anyone ever talked
to me the way I heard...

332
00:38:39,495 --> 00:38:43,146
the way she spoke to you...

333
00:38:43,232 --> 00:38:47,230
Sometimes when she talks
to me like that...

334
00:38:47,318 --> 00:38:51,706
I feel I'd like to go up there and
curse her and, and leave her forever.

335
00:38:51,793 --> 00:38:54,183
Or at least defy her.

336
00:38:58,963 --> 00:39:03,049
But I know I can't.
She's ill.

337
00:39:03,135 --> 00:39:07,177
She sounded strong.

338
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,784
No, I mean... ill.

339
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:15,129
She had to raise me all by herself,
after my father died.

340
00:39:15,217 --> 00:39:18,910
I was only five and it,
it must've been quite a strain for her.

341
00:39:18,998 --> 00:39:22,865
I mean, she didn't have to go to work or
anything. He left her a little money.

342
00:39:22,952 --> 00:39:27,558
Anyway, a few years ago,
Mother met this man.

343
00:39:27,645 --> 00:39:31,078
And he... he talked her
into building this motel.

344
00:39:31,165 --> 00:39:34,164
He could have talked her
into anything.

345
00:39:34,251 --> 00:39:38,335
And when he died too, it was
just too great a shock for her.

346
00:39:39,769 --> 00:39:41,769
And the way
he died...

347
00:39:43,377 --> 00:39:48,201
I guess it's nothing
to talk about while you're eating.

348
00:39:48,287 --> 00:39:52,894
Anyway, it was just too great
a loss for her. She had nothing left.

349
00:39:52,937 --> 00:39:55,327
Except you.

350
00:39:55,414 --> 00:39:58,673
Well, a son is a poor substitute
for a lover.

351
00:40:00,759 --> 00:40:03,194
Why don't you go away?

352
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,453
To a private island,
like you?

353
00:40:08,799 --> 00:40:12,406
No... not like me.

354
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:16,622
I couldn't do that.
Who'd look after her?

355
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:19,576
She'd be alone up there.

356
00:40:21,402 --> 00:40:23,748
The fire would go out.

357
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:27,659
It'd be cold and damp
like a grave.

358
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:32,136
If you love someone, you don't do that
to them, even if you hate them.

359
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:38,306
You understand, I...
I don't hate her.

360
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:42,478
I hate what she's become.
I hate the illness.

361
00:40:44,738 --> 00:40:49,692
Wouldn't it be better
if you put her... some place?

362
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:57,254
You mean an institution?
A madhouse?

363
00:40:59,644 --> 00:41:04,598
People always call
a madhouse "some place," don't they?

364
00:41:04,685 --> 00:41:06,640
Put her in "some place. "

365
00:41:08,422 --> 00:41:11,290
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to sound uncaring.

366
00:41:11,378 --> 00:41:13,767
What do you know
about caring?

367
00:41:13,897 --> 00:41:17,026
Have you ever seen the inside
of one of those places?

368
00:41:17,114 --> 00:41:20,851
The laughing and the tears...

369
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:23,284
and the cruel eyes
studying you.

370
00:41:23,372 --> 00:41:25,327
My mother there?

371
00:41:27,413 --> 00:41:30,412
But she's harmless.

372
00:41:31,976 --> 00:41:34,887
She's as harmless as one
of those stuffed birds.

373
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,755
I am sorry.

374
00:41:38,886 --> 00:41:43,014
I only felt...
It seems she's hurting you.

375
00:41:44,622 --> 00:41:48,706
- I meant well.
- People always mean well.

376
00:41:48,794 --> 00:41:52,401
They cluck their thick tongues
and shake their heads and suggest...

377
00:41:52,487 --> 00:41:54,530
oh, so very delicately...

378
00:42:01,135 --> 00:42:05,351
Of course,
I've suggested it myself.

379
00:42:05,438 --> 00:42:09,870
But I hate to even think about it.
She needs me.

380
00:42:14,477 --> 00:42:19,170
It... It's not as if she were
a... a maniac, a raving thing.

381
00:42:19,257 --> 00:42:21,778
She...

382
00:42:21,864 --> 00:42:24,950
She just goes
a little mad sometimes.

383
00:42:27,123 --> 00:42:30,382
We all go a little mad
sometimes.

384
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:34,467
Haven't you?

385
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,639
Yes.

386
00:42:38,726 --> 00:42:43,984
Sometimes just one time
can be enough. Thank you.

387
00:42:45,201 --> 00:42:47,156
Thank you, "Norman. "

388
00:42:47,243 --> 00:42:50,025
Norman.

389
00:42:50,111 --> 00:42:53,545
Oh, you're not... you're not
going back to your room already?

390
00:42:53,631 --> 00:42:56,369
I'm very tired.

391
00:42:56,457 --> 00:42:59,498
And I have a long drive tomorrow,
all the way back to Phoenix.

392
00:42:59,586 --> 00:43:01,367
Really?

393
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:04,800
I stepped into a private trap
back there...

394
00:43:04,887 --> 00:43:09,450
and I'd like to go back and try
to pull myself out of it...

395
00:43:11,101 --> 00:43:13,535
bef ore it's too late
for me too.

396
00:43:13,622 --> 00:43:17,011
Are you sure you wouldn't like
to stay a little while longer?

397
00:43:17,098 --> 00:43:20,792
- I mean, just for talk.
- Oh, I'd like to, but...

398
00:43:20,879 --> 00:43:23,269
All right. Well,
I'll see you in the morning.

399
00:43:23,356 --> 00:43:25,269
I'll bring you some breakfast,
all right?

400
00:43:25,355 --> 00:43:28,398
- What time?
- Very early. Dawn.

401
00:43:28,484 --> 00:43:30,700
All right, Miss, uh...

402
00:43:30,787 --> 00:43:32,786
- Crane.
- Crane. That's it.

403
00:43:32,873 --> 00:43:35,046
Good night.

404
00:47:42,056 --> 00:47:45,445
Ow! No!

405
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:47,879
No! Aaah!

406
00:49:50,167 --> 00:49:52,471
Mother! Oh, God, Mother!

407
00:49:52,557 --> 00:49:56,121
Blood! Blood!

408
01:00:21,814 --> 01:00:24,205
I've tried many brands.

409
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:28,072
So far, of those I've used, I haven't
had much luck with any of them.

410
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,071
Let's see what they say
about this one.

411
01:00:31,158 --> 01:00:33,548
They tell you
what its ingredients are...

412
01:00:33,678 --> 01:00:37,589
and how it's guaranteed to exterminate
every insect in the world...

413
01:00:37,677 --> 01:00:40,501
but they do not tell you
whether it's painless.

414
01:00:40,588 --> 01:00:44,412
And I say, insect or man,
death should always be painless.

415
01:00:44,499 --> 01:00:48,410
This one seems to claim more and better
qualities than lots of the others.

416
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,187
Sam?

417
01:01:02,273 --> 01:01:05,272
Sam!
Lady wants to see ya.

418
01:01:11,225 --> 01:01:13,790
- Yes, miss?
- I'm Marion's sister.

419
01:01:13,876 --> 01:01:16,570
- Oh, sure. Lila.
- Is Marion here?

420
01:01:18,353 --> 01:01:20,960
- Well, of course not. Something wrong?
- Thank you.

421
01:01:24,871 --> 01:01:26,957
- She left home on Friday.

422
01:01:27,044 --> 01:01:30,520
I was in Tucson over the weekend
and I haven't heard from her since.

423
01:01:30,607 --> 01:01:33,084
Not even
a phone call.

424
01:01:33,171 --> 01:01:36,605
If you two are in this together,
it's none of my business...

425
01:01:36,691 --> 01:01:39,820
but I want Marion to tell me it's none
of my business and then I'll go...

426
01:01:39,907 --> 01:01:43,427
Bob, run out and get yourself
some lunch, will ya?

427
01:01:43,557 --> 01:01:46,555
- That's okay. I brought it with me.
- Run out and eat it.

428
01:01:51,423 --> 01:01:55,508
Now, what thing
could we be in together?

429
01:01:55,595 --> 01:01:57,681
Sorry about the tears.

430
01:01:57,767 --> 01:02:01,027
Well, is Marion in trouble?
What is it?

431
01:02:01,114 --> 01:02:04,025
Let's all talk about
Marion, shall we?

432
01:02:07,633 --> 01:02:09,545
Who are you,
friend?

433
01:02:09,631 --> 01:02:11,891
My name is Arbogast,
friend.

434
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:14,803
I'm a private
investigator.

435
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:18,540
- Where is she, Miss Crane?
- I don't know you.

436
01:02:18,627 --> 01:02:22,625
I know you don't, because if you did
I wouldn't be able to follow you.

437
01:02:22,712 --> 01:02:25,103
What's your interest
in this?

438
01:02:25,233 --> 01:02:28,318
Well, $40,000.

439
01:02:29,666 --> 01:02:31,577
- $40,000?
- That's right.

440
01:02:34,967 --> 01:02:38,834
One of you'd better tell me what's going
on, and fast. I can take so much...

441
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:40,834
Now, take it easy,
friend.

442
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:44,701
It's just that your girlfriend
stole $40,000.

443
01:02:44,789 --> 01:02:47,178
What are you talking about?
What is this?

444
01:02:47,266 --> 01:02:51,741
She was supposed to bank it on Friday
for her boss, and she didn't.

445
01:02:51,829 --> 01:02:55,044
- No one has seen her since.
- Someone has seen her.

446
01:02:55,131 --> 01:02:57,608
Someone always sees a girl
with $40,000.

447
01:02:57,695 --> 01:03:01,085
They don't want to prosecute,
they just want the money back.

448
01:03:01,171 --> 01:03:04,083
- Sam, if she's here...
- She isn't. She isn't.

449
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:07,907
Miss Crane, can I ask you, did you come
up here on a hunch and nothing more?

450
01:03:08,037 --> 01:03:10,949
Oh, not even a hunch.
Just hope.

451
01:03:11,036 --> 01:03:14,730
Well, with a little checking
I could get to believe you.

452
01:03:14,817 --> 01:03:17,729
I don't care
if you believe me or not.

453
01:03:17,815 --> 01:03:20,944
All I want to do is see Marion
bef ore she gets in this too deeply.

454
01:03:21,032 --> 01:03:23,943
Did you check Phoenix?
Maybe she had an accident, or a hold-up.

455
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:29,157
No, she was seen leaving town in her
own car... by her employer, I might add.

456
01:03:29,245 --> 01:03:31,809
I can't believe it.
Can you?

457
01:03:33,373 --> 01:03:35,806
We're always quickest
to doubt people...

458
01:03:35,894 --> 01:03:38,327
who have a reputation
for being honest.

459
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:40,674
I think she's here,
Miss Crane.

460
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:43,195
Where there's
a boyfriend...

461
01:03:43,281 --> 01:03:48,192
She's not back there with the nuts and
bolts, but she's in this town somewhere.

462
01:03:48,279 --> 01:03:51,190
I'll find her.
I'll be seeing you.

463
01:04:27,999 --> 01:04:29,910
- Evening.
- Evening.

464
01:04:29,998 --> 01:04:31,910
I almost drove
right past.

465
01:04:31,996 --> 01:04:35,256
I'm always forgetting to turn
the sign on, but we do have a vacancy.

466
01:04:35,343 --> 01:04:38,211
Twelve, in fact.
Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.

467
01:04:38,298 --> 01:04:40,210
- Candy?
- No, thanks.

468
01:04:40,297 --> 01:04:44,208
Last two days I've been to so many
motels my eyes are bleary with neon...

469
01:04:44,295 --> 01:04:47,728
but this is the first place that looks
like it's hiding from the world.

470
01:04:47,815 --> 01:04:50,727
To tell the truth, I didn't
really forget to turn the sign on.

471
01:04:50,814 --> 01:04:53,726
- Just doesn't seem like any use any more.
- Oh?

472
01:04:53,812 --> 01:04:57,246
See, that used to be
the main highway right there.

473
01:04:57,332 --> 01:05:00,244
- Wanna register?
- Sit down. I don't wanna trouble you.

474
01:05:00,331 --> 01:05:03,243
- I just wanna ask a few questions.
- No trouble. Today's linen day.

475
01:05:03,329 --> 01:05:06,241
I always change the beds once a week
whether they've been used or not.

476
01:05:06,328 --> 01:05:10,891
Hate the smell of dampness. It's such
a, I don't know... creepy smell.

477
01:05:12,151 --> 01:05:14,150
You out to buy
a motel?

478
01:05:15,671 --> 01:05:17,583
No.

479
01:05:17,670 --> 01:05:20,364
Reason I ask, you said you'd seen
so many the past couple of days...

480
01:05:20,494 --> 01:05:22,277
I thought maybe...

481
01:05:22,363 --> 01:05:25,275
What, uh... What was it
you wanted to ask?

482
01:05:25,362 --> 01:05:27,883
I'm looking for
a missing person.

483
01:05:27,969 --> 01:05:30,924
My name's Arbogast.
I'm a private investigator.

484
01:05:31,012 --> 01:05:33,445
I've been trying
to trace a girl...

485
01:05:33,531 --> 01:05:36,965
that's been missing for,
oh, about a week now from Phoenix.

486
01:05:37,051 --> 01:05:39,833
It's a private matter.
The family wants to forgive her.

487
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,919
She's not
in any trouble.

488
01:05:42,006 --> 01:05:44,874
I didn't think the police went looking
for people who aren't in trouble.

489
01:05:44,961 --> 01:05:47,003
- I'm not the police.
- Oh, yeah.

490
01:05:47,090 --> 01:05:51,653
We have reason to believe she came
along this way. Did she stop here?

491
01:05:51,741 --> 01:05:54,652
No one's stopped here
for a couple of weeks.

492
01:05:54,739 --> 01:05:56,651
Mind looking at the picture
bef ore committing yourself?

493
01:05:56,737 --> 01:05:58,172
Commit myself?

494
01:05:58,259 --> 01:06:01,605
- You sure talk like a policeman.
- Look at the picture, please.

495
01:06:03,213 --> 01:06:05,255
- Mm-mmm. Yeah.
- Sure?

496
01:06:06,385 --> 01:06:08,254
Well, she may have
used an alias.

497
01:06:08,384 --> 01:06:10,296
Marion Crane's
her real name...

498
01:06:10,384 --> 01:06:13,773
but she could've registered
under a different one.

499
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:17,988
I tell ya, I don't even much bother
with guests registering any more.

500
01:06:18,076 --> 01:06:20,986
One by one,
you drop the formalities.

501
01:06:21,074 --> 01:06:24,985
I shouldn't even bother changing
the sheets, but old habits die hard.

502
01:06:25,116 --> 01:06:26,897
Which reminds me...

503
01:06:28,853 --> 01:06:30,722
- What's that?
- The sign.

504
01:06:30,808 --> 01:06:34,154
A couple last week said
if the thing hadn't been on...

505
01:06:34,242 --> 01:06:37,152
they would've thought
this was an old, deserted...

506
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,369
You see,
that's exactly my point.

507
01:06:39,456 --> 01:06:41,846
Nobody'd been here
for a couple weeks...

508
01:06:41,933 --> 01:06:45,845
and there's a couple came by
and didn't know that you were open.

509
01:06:45,975 --> 01:06:48,017
As you say,
old habits die hard.

510
01:06:48,104 --> 01:06:51,928
This girl could've registered
under another name. Mind if I look?

511
01:06:52,015 --> 01:06:54,231
- No.
- Thank you.

512
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:58,273
All right.

513
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:02,097
I'll get the date
somewhere. Mm-hmm.

514
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:04,661
See, there's nobody.

515
01:07:04,791 --> 01:07:08,181
Let's see, I have a sample
of her handwriting here.

516
01:07:09,528 --> 01:07:11,440
Oh, yes.

517
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,439
Here we are.

518
01:07:13,526 --> 01:07:15,439
- Marie Samuels.
- Hmm.

519
01:07:15,525 --> 01:07:17,437
That's an interesting
alias.

520
01:07:17,525 --> 01:07:19,958
- Is that her?
- Yeah, I think so.

521
01:07:20,045 --> 01:07:21,957
Marie, Marion.

522
01:07:22,044 --> 01:07:25,217
- Samuels. Her boyfriend's name is Sam.
- Mm-hmm.

523
01:07:25,303 --> 01:07:30,083
Mm-hmm. Was she
in disguise, by any chance?

524
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:33,777
- Wanna check the picture again?
- I wasn't lying to you.

525
01:07:33,864 --> 01:07:36,776
Oh, I know that.
I know you wouldn't lie.

526
01:07:36,862 --> 01:07:38,731
It's tough keeping track
of the time around here.

527
01:07:38,818 --> 01:07:40,079
I know.

528
01:07:40,209 --> 01:07:42,251
Oh, yeah.

529
01:07:42,338 --> 01:07:47,466
Well, i-i-it was raining
and, um, her hair was all wet.

530
01:07:47,553 --> 01:07:49,466
I tell ya, it's not really
a very good picture of her.

531
01:07:49,596 --> 01:07:51,247
No, I guess not.

532
01:07:51,334 --> 01:07:53,246
Tell me all about her.

533
01:07:53,333 --> 01:07:55,419
Well, um...

534
01:07:55,505 --> 01:07:59,635
she arrived, um, rather late
one night, went straight to sleep...

535
01:07:59,721 --> 01:08:02,242
and, uh, left early
the next morning.

536
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:05,457
- How early?
- Oh, ex... very early.

537
01:08:05,544 --> 01:08:08,761
Mm-hmm.
Which morning was that?

538
01:08:08,847 --> 01:08:10,759
Uh, the, um...

539
01:08:10,846 --> 01:08:14,106
Th-Th-Th-The next morning.

540
01:08:14,192 --> 01:08:16,495
- Sunday.
- I see. Mm-hmm.

541
01:08:16,583 --> 01:08:18,495
- Did anyone meet her here?
- No.

542
01:08:18,581 --> 01:08:21,276
- Did she arrive with anyone?
- No.

543
01:08:21,363 --> 01:08:24,144
- Did she make any phone calls or...
- No.

544
01:08:24,231 --> 01:08:26,143
- Locally?
- Uh-uh.

545
01:08:26,230 --> 01:08:30,141
- Did you spend the night with her?
- No.

546
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:33,487
Then how would you know
she didn't make any calls?

547
01:08:35,747 --> 01:08:37,789
Uh, w-w...

548
01:08:37,876 --> 01:08:40,136
Well, she was very tired
a- and, uh...

549
01:08:40,223 --> 01:08:42,961
See, I... N-Now I'm starting
to, um... remember.

550
01:08:43,048 --> 01:08:45,525
I- I'm making a mental picture
of it in my mind.

551
01:08:45,612 --> 01:08:48,654
- If you make a mental picturization...
- Right. Take your time.

552
01:08:48,741 --> 01:08:51,913
Um, she was...
she was sitting back there...

553
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,912
N- No, she was standing back there
with a sandwich in her hand.

554
01:08:54,998 --> 01:08:57,910
She said she had to
go to sleep early...

555
01:08:57,997 --> 01:09:02,125
because she had a long d-d-dr-drive,
uh, ahead of her.

556
01:09:02,213 --> 01:09:04,907
- Mm-hmm. Back where?
- Back where she came from.

557
01:09:04,993 --> 01:09:07,688
No, you said bef ore she
was standing back there...

558
01:09:07,819 --> 01:09:09,730
Yes, b-back in my parlour.

559
01:09:09,817 --> 01:09:12,729
She was very hungry,
I made her a sandwich...

560
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:17,727
and then she said she was tired and
she, uh, um, had to go r-right to bed.

561
01:09:17,813 --> 01:09:19,725
I see.
How did she pay you?

562
01:09:19,813 --> 01:09:21,550
- Cash? Cheque?
- Cash.

563
01:09:21,638 --> 01:09:23,550
Cash, huh?
Mm-hmm.

564
01:09:23,636 --> 01:09:28,069
- After she left, she didn't come back?
- Uh-uh. Why should she?

565
01:09:28,157 --> 01:09:30,242
Hmm.

566
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:36,240
Well, M-Mr. Arbogast, uh,
I guess that's about it.

567
01:09:36,326 --> 01:09:39,890
I- I've got some work to do,
if you don't mind.

568
01:09:39,976 --> 01:09:42,888
To tell you the truth,
I do mind.

569
01:09:42,975 --> 01:09:46,321
See, if it doesn't jell,
it isn't aspic, and this ain't jelling.

570
01:09:46,451 --> 01:09:49,363
It's not coming together.
Something's missing.

571
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:52,883
Well, I-I-I don't know
what you c-could expect me to know.

572
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:54,883
People just come and go,
you know.

573
01:09:54,969 --> 01:09:57,402
That's right.
She isn't still here, is she?

574
01:09:57,490 --> 01:09:59,271
No.

575
01:09:59,358 --> 01:10:04,964
If I wanted to check the cabins, all
twelve, I'd need a warrant, wouldn't I?

576
01:10:05,052 --> 01:10:08,441
If you don't believe me, come on
with me. You can help me change beds.

577
01:10:08,528 --> 01:10:10,483
Oh.
No, thanks.

578
01:10:27,518 --> 01:10:29,431
Uh, change your mind?

579
01:10:31,168 --> 01:10:33,081
Oh.

580
01:10:33,168 --> 01:10:36,949
You know, I... I think I have one of
those faces you can't help believing.

581
01:10:37,035 --> 01:10:38,860
- Is anyone at home?
- No.

582
01:10:38,948 --> 01:10:41,512
Oh? There's somebody
sitting in the window.

583
01:10:41,642 --> 01:10:43,684
- N-N-No, there isn't.
- Sure. Take a look.

584
01:10:43,814 --> 01:10:45,770
Oh, th-that must be
my mother.

585
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:48,291
She's an, uh, "inavlid... "
an invalid.

586
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:50,855
Uh, it's practically
like living alone.

587
01:10:50,942 --> 01:10:52,984
Oh, I see.

588
01:10:53,115 --> 01:10:57,808
If this girl, Marion Crane, were here,
you wouldn't be hiding her, would you?

589
01:10:57,895 --> 01:11:00,285
- No.
- Not even if she paid you well?

590
01:11:00,415 --> 01:11:02,371
No.

591
01:11:02,501 --> 01:11:07,239
Let's say, for the sake of argument,
she wanted you to gallantly protect her.

592
01:11:07,325 --> 01:11:09,367
You'd know
you were being used.

593
01:11:09,455 --> 01:11:12,453
- You wouldn't be made a fool of.
- I'm not a fool.

594
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:15,061
And I'm not capable of being fooled,
not even by a woman.

595
01:11:15,147 --> 01:11:18,102
- This is not a slur on your manhood.
- Let's put it this way.

596
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:21,579
She might have fooled me,
but she didn't fool my mother.

597
01:11:21,666 --> 01:11:24,578
Then your mother met her.
Could I talk to your mother?

598
01:11:24,664 --> 01:11:26,707
No. As I told you,
she's confined.

599
01:11:26,794 --> 01:11:30,575
Just for a few minutes. There might be
some hint that you missed out on.

600
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:33,790
Sick old women
are usually pretty sharp.

601
01:11:33,877 --> 01:11:35,790
- I wouldn't disturb her.
- Mr Arbogast, I-I think I've...

602
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,353
- I think I've talked to you all I want.
- Yes, but just for...

603
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:42,351
It'd be much better
if you left now. Thanks.

604
01:11:42,439 --> 01:11:44,437
Well, all right.

605
01:11:44,525 --> 01:11:48,392
You sure would save me a lot of
leg work if you'd let me talk to her.

606
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:51,565
- Would I need a warrant for that too?
- Sure.

607
01:11:51,651 --> 01:11:53,563
All right.
Thanks, anyway.

608
01:12:47,972 --> 01:12:51,405
Hello, Loomis.
This is Arbogast. Is Lila there?

609
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:53,882
Let me talk to her,
please.

610
01:12:55,228 --> 01:12:57,314
Hello, Lila.

611
01:12:57,402 --> 01:13:01,183
Lila, listen.
Marion was up here.

612
01:13:01,269 --> 01:13:04,181
Yes, she spent last Saturday night
at the Bates Motel.

613
01:13:04,268 --> 01:13:06,180
It's out
on the old highway.

614
01:13:06,267 --> 01:13:09,700
I even know what cabin she was in...
it was number one.

615
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:14,090
Well, this young fella that runs the
place said she just spent the night...

616
01:13:14,176 --> 01:13:16,870
left the next day
and that was it.

617
01:13:16,958 --> 01:13:20,347
Mmm.
Um, no, not exactly.

618
01:13:22,173 --> 01:13:24,084
Well, I did question him,
believe me...

619
01:13:24,171 --> 01:13:27,083
but I think I got
all there was to get.

620
01:13:27,169 --> 01:13:30,081
I'll just have to pick up
the pieces from here.

621
01:13:30,168 --> 01:13:33,601
Well, I tell ya,
I don't feel entirely satisfied, uh...

622
01:13:33,688 --> 01:13:36,600
See, this boy
had a sick old mother.

623
01:13:36,686 --> 01:13:39,555
I think she saw Marion
and talked to her.

624
01:13:39,642 --> 01:13:42,944
No. No, unf ortunately,
he wouldn't let me see her.

625
01:13:43,032 --> 01:13:47,507
Well, I was, but I think I'll go
back to the motel first.

626
01:13:47,595 --> 01:13:51,376
No, you stay there with Loomis.
I'll be back in about an hour.

627
01:13:51,462 --> 01:13:53,374
All right, fine.
Listen, I...

628
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:56,372
You'll be happy to know
what I think.

629
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:00,371
Uh, I think our friend Sam Loomis
didn't know that Marion was here.

630
01:14:01,936 --> 01:14:04,804
All right. See ya
in about an hour... or less.

631
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:06,802
All right, bye-bye.

632
01:15:02,471 --> 01:15:04,340
Bates?

633
01:17:37,656 --> 01:17:41,872
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely
sound. Ever notice that, Lila?

634
01:17:43,783 --> 01:17:46,695
Sam, he said
an hour or less.

635
01:17:46,782 --> 01:17:49,042
Yeah.

636
01:17:49,129 --> 01:17:51,040
It's been three.

637
01:17:51,128 --> 01:17:53,214
Are we just
going to sit here and wait?

638
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:55,430
He'll be back.

639
01:17:55,517 --> 01:17:57,994
Let's sit still
and hang on, okay?

640
01:18:02,904 --> 01:18:06,338
- How far is the old highway?
- You wanna go out there, don't you?

641
01:18:06,424 --> 01:18:08,858
- Bust in on Arbogast and the old lady.
- Yes.

642
01:18:08,945 --> 01:18:11,205
- Maybe shake her up.
- Yes!

643
01:18:11,292 --> 01:18:14,246
- That wouldn't be wise.
- Patience doesn't run in my family.

644
01:18:14,334 --> 01:18:16,246
- I'm going out there.
- Arbogast said...

645
01:18:16,332 --> 01:18:18,245
An hour, or less.

646
01:18:21,852 --> 01:18:23,763
- Well, I'm going.

647
01:18:23,851 --> 01:18:25,763
You'll never find it.

648
01:18:28,978 --> 01:18:31,413
- Stay here.
- Why can't I go?

649
01:18:31,499 --> 01:18:35,410
I don't know. One of us has to be here,
in case he's on the way.

650
01:18:35,497 --> 01:18:37,931
What am I supposed to do,
just sit here and wait?

651
01:18:38,018 --> 01:18:39,582
Yeah. Stay here.

652
01:18:59,876 --> 01:19:01,789
Arbogast?

653
01:19:02,875 --> 01:19:04,788
Arbogast!

654
01:19:07,656 --> 01:19:09,568
Arbogast!

655
01:19:38,901 --> 01:19:41,508
- He didn't come back here?
- Sam!

656
01:19:41,595 --> 01:19:44,898
No Arbogast, no Bates.
Only the old lady at home.

657
01:19:44,985 --> 01:19:48,201
Sick old lady unable to answer
the door... or unwilling.

658
01:19:48,288 --> 01:19:50,199
Where could he
have gone?

659
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:52,199
Maybe he got
some definite lead.

660
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:54,241
- Maybe he went right on.
- Without calling me?

661
01:19:54,329 --> 01:19:56,240
- In a hurry.
- Sam, he called...

662
01:19:56,327 --> 01:19:58,240
when he had nothing
but a dissatisfied feeling.

663
01:19:58,326 --> 01:20:02,237
Don't you think he'd have called
if he had anything at all?

664
01:20:02,324 --> 01:20:04,237
Yes, I think
he would've.

665
01:20:04,323 --> 01:20:06,540
- Let's go see Al Chambers.
- Who's he?

666
01:20:06,626 --> 01:20:10,060
- Our deputy sheriff around here.
- Let me get my coat.

667
01:20:18,317 --> 01:20:20,229
Good evening.

668
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:24,400
Well, I... I don't know where to start,
except at the beginning.

669
01:20:24,487 --> 01:20:26,400
Yes.

670
01:20:26,486 --> 01:20:29,398
- This is Lila Crane from Phoenix.
- How do you do?

671
01:20:29,485 --> 01:20:32,397
She's been here
searching for her sister.

672
01:20:32,483 --> 01:20:34,395
There's this
private detective helping.

673
01:20:34,483 --> 01:20:37,177
We got a call from this
detective... he'd traced her...

674
01:20:37,263 --> 01:20:39,132
to that motel
on the old highway.

675
01:20:39,219 --> 01:20:41,132
That must be
the Bates Motel.

676
01:20:41,218 --> 01:20:44,261
He called to say he was going
to question Mrs Bates.

677
01:20:44,347 --> 01:20:46,259
Norman took a wife?

678
01:20:46,347 --> 01:20:49,736
No, I-I don't think so.
An old woman. His mother.

679
01:20:49,823 --> 01:20:52,865
That was early this evening. We
haven't seen or heard from him since.

680
01:20:52,908 --> 01:20:56,516
Now, your sister's
missing how long?

681
01:20:56,602 --> 01:20:59,601
She left Phoenix a week ago
yesterday without a trace.

682
01:20:59,687 --> 01:21:03,338
How'd you and this detective come
to trace her to Fairvale?

683
01:21:03,425 --> 01:21:05,598
They thought
she'd be coming to me.

684
01:21:05,684 --> 01:21:08,119
- Left Phoenix under her own steam?
- Yes.

685
01:21:08,205 --> 01:21:10,117
She's not missing so much
as she's run away.

686
01:21:10,205 --> 01:21:12,116
That's right.

687
01:21:12,203 --> 01:21:14,116
From what?

688
01:21:15,853 --> 01:21:17,766
She stole some money.

689
01:21:17,896 --> 01:21:19,852
A lot?

690
01:21:19,982 --> 01:21:21,938
Forty thousand dollars.

691
01:21:22,024 --> 01:21:23,980
The police haven't
been able to...

692
01:21:24,110 --> 01:21:27,674
Everyone concerned thought if they
could get her to give the money back...

693
01:21:27,761 --> 01:21:30,673
they could avoid involving her
with the police.

694
01:21:30,759 --> 01:21:32,671
That explains
the private detective.

695
01:21:32,759 --> 01:21:34,757
He traced her
to the Bates place.

696
01:21:34,845 --> 01:21:37,756
What exactly did he say
when he called you?

697
01:21:37,843 --> 01:21:41,145
He said Marion was there
for one night, then she left.

698
01:21:41,233 --> 01:21:43,145
- With the $40,000?
- He didn't say anything...

699
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:45,665
about the money.

700
01:21:45,752 --> 01:21:48,142
It isn't important
what he said, is it?

701
01:21:48,229 --> 01:21:52,010
He was supposed to come talk to us after
he talked to the mother, and he didn't.

702
01:21:52,096 --> 01:21:54,009
That's what I want you
to do something about.

703
01:21:54,096 --> 01:21:55,486
Like what?

704
01:21:55,574 --> 01:21:58,007
I'm sorry if
I seem overanxious.

705
01:21:58,093 --> 01:22:01,831
I'm sure there's something wrong
out there, and I have to know what.

706
01:22:01,918 --> 01:22:05,699
Well, I think there's something wrong
too, Miss, but not the same thing.

707
01:22:05,785 --> 01:22:08,697
I think what's wrong
is your private detective.

708
01:22:08,784 --> 01:22:12,869
I think he got himself a hot lead
as to where your sister was goin'...

709
01:22:12,956 --> 01:22:14,911
probably from Norman Bates...

710
01:22:14,999 --> 01:22:18,258
and called you to keep you still while
he took off after her and the money.

711
01:22:18,345 --> 01:22:22,734
No, no, he said he was dissatisfied
and he was going back there.

712
01:22:22,821 --> 01:22:25,385
Call Norman and let him
say what happened.

713
01:22:25,471 --> 01:22:27,515
At this hour?

714
01:22:27,601 --> 01:22:31,512
He was out when I was there a while ago.
If he's back, he probably isn't in bed.

715
01:22:31,599 --> 01:22:36,466
He wasn't out; he just wasn't answerin' the
door in the dead of night like some people do.

716
01:22:36,553 --> 01:22:39,421
This fellow lives
like a hermit.

717
01:22:39,509 --> 01:22:42,289
You must remember that bad business
out there about ten years ago.

718
01:22:42,377 --> 01:22:44,289
Please. Call.

719
01:22:49,808 --> 01:22:53,936
Florrie, the sheriff wants you
to connect him with the Bates Motel.

720
01:23:00,107 --> 01:23:03,192
Norman?
Sheriff Chambers.

721
01:23:03,279 --> 01:23:06,235
Ye... I been
just fine, thanks.

722
01:23:06,321 --> 01:23:08,885
Listen, we got
worries here.

723
01:23:08,973 --> 01:23:12,362
Yeah, have you had a fella
stop by there tonight...

724
01:23:13,709 --> 01:23:16,055
Well, this one
wouldn't be a customer.

725
01:23:16,143 --> 01:23:19,184
- A private detective, name of...
- Arbogast.

726
01:23:19,272 --> 01:23:21,184
Arbogast.

727
01:23:23,704 --> 01:23:25,616
And after he left?

728
01:23:28,310 --> 01:23:30,484
No, that's...
that's okay, Norman.

729
01:23:33,222 --> 01:23:36,132
This detective was there,
Norman told him about the girl...

730
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:39,131
the detective thanked him
and he went away.

731
01:23:39,219 --> 01:23:42,521
And he didn't come back?
He didn't see the mother?

732
01:23:42,608 --> 01:23:45,519
Your detective told you
he couldn't come right back...

733
01:23:45,607 --> 01:23:49,039
because he was going to question
Norman Bates' mother, right?

734
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:51,039
Yes.

735
01:23:51,169 --> 01:23:53,993
Norman Bates' mother
has been dead and buried...

736
01:23:54,081 --> 01:23:58,209
in Greenlawn Cemetery
for the past ten years.

737
01:23:58,296 --> 01:24:01,903
I helped Norman pick out the dress
she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

738
01:24:01,990 --> 01:24:03,901
'Tain't only
local history, Sam.

739
01:24:03,989 --> 01:24:07,856
It's the only case of murder
and suicide on Fairvale ledgers.

740
01:24:07,943 --> 01:24:11,724
Mrs Bates poisoned this guy
she was... involved with...

741
01:24:11,811 --> 01:24:14,245
when she found out
he was married...

742
01:24:14,331 --> 01:24:17,548
then took a helpin' of
the same stuff herself.

743
01:24:17,634 --> 01:24:21,241
Strychnine.
Ugly way to die.

744
01:24:21,328 --> 01:24:24,066
Norman found them
dead together.

745
01:24:24,153 --> 01:24:27,021
In bed.

746
01:24:27,108 --> 01:24:29,542
You mean that old woman I saw sittin'
in the window wasn't Bates' mother?

747
01:24:29,628 --> 01:24:34,191
Now, wait a minute, Sam.
Are you sure you saw an old woman?

748
01:24:34,278 --> 01:24:36,625
Yes! In the house
behind the motel!

749
01:24:36,712 --> 01:24:38,929
I called and pounded
but she just ignored me!

750
01:24:39,015 --> 01:24:41,492
You saw
Norman Bates' mother?

751
01:24:41,579 --> 01:24:45,229
But it had to be...
because Arbogast said so too!

752
01:24:45,317 --> 01:24:48,967
And the young man wouldn't let him
see her because she was too ill.

753
01:24:49,054 --> 01:24:52,965
Well, if the woman up there
is Mrs Bates...

754
01:24:53,051 --> 01:24:56,702
who's that woman buried
out in Greenlawn Cemetery?

755
01:25:39,333 --> 01:25:43,505
Now, Mother, um...
I- I'm gonna bring something up...

756
01:25:43,593 --> 01:25:46,156
I am sorry, boy...

757
01:25:46,243 --> 01:25:49,850
but you do manage to look ludicrous
when you give me orders.

758
01:25:49,937 --> 01:25:51,849
Please, Mother.

759
01:25:51,936 --> 01:25:55,108
No!
I will not hide in the fruit cellar.

760
01:25:55,196 --> 01:25:58,367
Ha! You think
I'm fruity, huh?

761
01:25:58,455 --> 01:26:00,497
I'm staying right here.

762
01:26:00,584 --> 01:26:03,452
This is my room and
no one will drag me out of it...

763
01:26:03,539 --> 01:26:06,016
least of all
my big, bold son.

764
01:26:06,103 --> 01:26:08,015
They'll come now, Mother.

765
01:26:08,102 --> 01:26:11,883
He came after the girl,
and now someone will come after him.

766
01:26:11,970 --> 01:26:16,098
Mother, please, it's just for
a few days so they won't find you.

767
01:26:16,185 --> 01:26:18,358
Just for a few days?

768
01:26:18,444 --> 01:26:22,225
In that dark, dank
fruit cellar? No!

769
01:26:22,313 --> 01:26:25,702
You hid me there once, boy, and you
won't do it again, not ever again!

770
01:26:25,789 --> 01:26:28,744
Now get out!

771
01:26:28,831 --> 01:26:32,612
- I told you to get out, boy.
- I'll carry you, Mother.

772
01:26:32,699 --> 01:26:35,741
Norman, what do you
think you're doing?

773
01:26:35,828 --> 01:26:39,391
Don't you touch me!
Don't! Norman!

774
01:26:44,519 --> 01:26:47,691
Put me down! Put me down!
I can walk on my own.

775
01:26:53,037 --> 01:26:54,948
Wonderful sermon today.

776
01:26:55,036 --> 01:26:57,513
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

777
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,816
We thought we'd drive out
to that motel with you.

778
01:26:59,946 --> 01:27:02,249
- He's already been.
- Went out bef ore service.

779
01:27:02,337 --> 01:27:04,944
- Did you two have breakfast?
- Didn't find anything?

780
01:27:05,031 --> 01:27:08,637
Nothing. Let's
clear the way here.

781
01:27:08,725 --> 01:27:11,028
What did he say
about my sister?

782
01:27:11,114 --> 01:27:14,374
Just what he told your detective:
She used a fake name.

783
01:27:14,461 --> 01:27:18,676
Saw the register myself. Saw the
whole place. That boy's alone there.

784
01:27:18,806 --> 01:27:21,718
- No mother?
- You must have seen an illusion, Sam.

785
01:27:21,805 --> 01:27:24,195
I know you're not
the seein'- illusions type...

786
01:27:24,282 --> 01:27:27,150
but no woman was there and I don't
believe in ghosts, so there it is.

787
01:27:27,238 --> 01:27:29,149
I still feel
there's something...

788
01:27:29,236 --> 01:27:32,800
Can see you do. I'm sorry I couldn't
make you feel better.

789
01:27:32,886 --> 01:27:37,319
Come to my office this afternoon and
report a missing person and a theft.

790
01:27:37,406 --> 01:27:40,275
The sooner you drop this
in the lap of the law...

791
01:27:40,361 --> 01:27:43,837
that's the sooner you stand a chance
of your sister bein' picked up.

792
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:45,967
How 'bout that?

793
01:27:46,054 --> 01:27:49,140
- I don't know.
- It's Sunday.

794
01:27:49,226 --> 01:27:53,442
Come to the house and do your reporting
around dinnertime. It'll make it nicer.

795
01:27:53,529 --> 01:27:55,440
You too, Sam.

796
01:27:55,528 --> 01:27:58,439
Thank you.

797
01:27:58,527 --> 01:28:03,437
- Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
- No, you're not.

798
01:28:03,567 --> 01:28:06,696
- You want me to drop you at the hotel...
- Sam.

799
01:28:06,783 --> 01:28:11,433
I still won't feel satisfied
until I go out there.

800
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,693
Neither will I.
Come on.

801
01:28:14,779 --> 01:28:18,864
We better decide what we're gonna say
or do when we walk in there.

802
01:28:18,951 --> 01:28:21,167
We're going to register
as man and wife.

803
01:28:21,254 --> 01:28:24,427
We're going to
get shown to a cabin...

804
01:28:24,513 --> 01:28:28,077
and then we're going to search every
inch of the place, inside and out.

805
01:28:51,457 --> 01:28:54,368
I wonder where Norman Bates
does his hermiting.

806
01:28:54,456 --> 01:28:56,368
Someone's at that window.
I just saw the curtain move.

807
01:28:56,454 --> 01:28:57,585
Come on.

808
01:29:00,887 --> 01:29:03,277
- Well?
- Just coming up to ring for you.

809
01:29:03,364 --> 01:29:05,277
Uh-huh.
Suppose you want a room.

810
01:29:05,363 --> 01:29:07,796
We were gonna try to make it
to San Francisco...

811
01:29:07,884 --> 01:29:10,273
but we don't like the look
of that sky.

812
01:29:10,404 --> 01:29:13,316
Looks like a bad day coming,
doesn't it?

813
01:29:20,182 --> 01:29:22,616
- I'll take you to cabin ten.
- Better sign in first, hadn't we?

814
01:29:22,702 --> 01:29:24,614
That's not necessary.

815
01:29:24,702 --> 01:29:28,395
My boss is paying for this trip
and, uh, well, it's 90%business.

816
01:29:28,483 --> 01:29:31,263
He wants practically
notarized receipts.

817
01:29:31,351 --> 01:29:34,305
I'd better sign in
and get a receipt.

818
01:29:52,123 --> 01:29:54,035
Thank you.

819
01:29:56,425 --> 01:29:58,338
- I'll get your bags.
- Haven't any.

820
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:04,986
- I'll show you the room, then.
- First time I've ever seen it happen.

821
01:30:05,073 --> 01:30:06,985
You check in any other place
in this country without bags...

822
01:30:07,072 --> 01:30:10,984
- and you have to pay in advance.
- Ten dollars.

823
01:30:17,589 --> 01:30:19,935
That receipt.

824
01:30:24,803 --> 01:30:27,410
I'll go on ahead.

825
01:30:32,104 --> 01:30:35,058
All right, there's
your receipt. I'll show you the cabin.

826
01:30:35,145 --> 01:30:38,013
Don't bother yourself.
We'll find it.

827
01:30:56,526 --> 01:30:58,830
Sam, we have to go into that cabin
and search it...

828
01:30:58,916 --> 01:31:01,871
no matter what we're afraid of
finding or how much it may hurt.

829
01:31:01,959 --> 01:31:03,870
I know.

830
01:31:03,957 --> 01:31:05,870
Do you think if something
happened, it happened there?

831
01:31:05,956 --> 01:31:07,868
I don't know, but if you had...

832
01:31:07,956 --> 01:31:11,388
a useless business like this motel,
what would you need to get out?

833
01:31:11,476 --> 01:31:14,822
To get a new business somewhere else?
Forty thousand dollars?

834
01:31:17,646 --> 01:31:19,732
How could we prove that...

835
01:31:19,819 --> 01:31:22,600
If he opens a motel on
the new highway in, say, a year...

836
01:31:22,688 --> 01:31:24,904
There must be some proof
that exists now...

837
01:31:24,990 --> 01:31:28,206
something that proves he got
that money away from Marion somehow.

838
01:31:28,294 --> 01:31:33,248
- What makes you sound so certain?
- Arbogast. He liked me, Sam.

839
01:31:33,334 --> 01:31:35,246
Or he felt sorry for me
and he was beginning to feel...

840
01:31:35,376 --> 01:31:36,941
the same way about you.

841
01:31:37,028 --> 01:31:39,766
I could tell the last time
I talked to him on the phone.

842
01:31:39,853 --> 01:31:42,286
He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done
anything without telling us...

843
01:31:42,374 --> 01:31:43,764
unless he was stopped.

844
01:31:43,850 --> 01:31:47,631
And he was stopped. So he must
have found out something.

845
01:31:49,978 --> 01:31:52,629
We'll start with cabin one.

846
01:31:54,498 --> 01:31:57,627
If he sees us,
we're just taking the air.

847
01:32:29,611 --> 01:32:31,566
Bates.

848
01:33:20,238 --> 01:33:22,194
No shower curtain.

849
01:33:22,281 --> 01:33:24,758
- Sam! Look!
- Huh? What is it?

850
01:33:24,888 --> 01:33:27,018
It's figuring. It didn't
get washed down. Look.

851
01:33:27,104 --> 01:33:31,015
Some figure has been added to
or subtracted from 40,000.

852
01:33:31,146 --> 01:33:33,580
That proves Marion was here.
It'd be too wild a coincidence...

853
01:33:33,667 --> 01:33:35,578
Bates never denied she was here.

854
01:33:35,666 --> 01:33:38,795
Oh. Doesn't that prove
he found out about the money?

855
01:33:38,882 --> 01:33:41,489
Do we simply ask him
where he's hidden it?

856
01:33:41,576 --> 01:33:44,922
But that old woman, whoever she is,
she told Arbogast something.

857
01:33:45,009 --> 01:33:48,355
I want her to tell us
the same thing.

858
01:33:48,442 --> 01:33:50,659
- You can't go up there.
- Why not?

859
01:33:50,745 --> 01:33:52,657
- Bates.
- Well, let's find him.

860
01:33:52,745 --> 01:33:55,916
One of us can keep him occupied while
the other gets to the old woman.

861
01:33:56,004 --> 01:33:59,263
You'll never be able to hold him
still if he doesn't want to be held.

862
01:33:59,350 --> 01:34:02,305
I don't like you going
into that house alone.

863
01:34:02,392 --> 01:34:04,304
I can handle a sick old woman.

864
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:07,302
All right, I'll find Bates
and keep him occupied.

865
01:34:08,345 --> 01:34:10,301
Wait a minute.

866
01:34:10,388 --> 01:34:13,647
If you get anything
out of the mother...

867
01:34:13,734 --> 01:34:15,907
can you find your way
back to town?

868
01:34:15,993 --> 01:34:18,297
Yes, of course.

869
01:34:18,384 --> 01:34:21,774
If you do get anything,
don't stop to tell me.

870
01:34:44,589 --> 01:34:47,152
- You looking for me?
- Why, yes, as a matter of fact.

871
01:34:47,283 --> 01:34:49,412
Wife's taking a nap and...

872
01:34:49,499 --> 01:34:53,454
I never can keep quiet enough for her,
so I thought I'd look you up and talk.

873
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:56,843
- Good. You satisfied with your cabin?
- Oh, it's fine.

874
01:36:09,982 --> 01:36:12,936
I've been doing all the talking
so far, haven't I?

875
01:36:13,024 --> 01:36:15,457
I thought it was the people
who were alone most of the time...

876
01:36:15,544 --> 01:36:17,890
who did all the talking
when they got the chance.

877
01:36:18,021 --> 01:36:20,107
Here you are
doing all the listening.

878
01:36:20,194 --> 01:36:22,671
- You are alone here, aren't you?
- Mm-hmm.

879
01:36:22,758 --> 01:36:25,322
Drive me crazy.

880
01:36:25,409 --> 01:36:28,364
I think that would be a rather
extreme reaction, don't you?

881
01:36:28,450 --> 01:36:33,535
Just an expression. What I meant was,
uh, I'd do anything to get away.

882
01:36:33,665 --> 01:36:35,621
- Wouldn't you?
- No.

883
01:36:39,662 --> 01:36:42,835
- Mrs Bates?

884
01:37:59,710 --> 01:38:02,231
I'm not saying you
shouldn't be contented here...

885
01:38:02,318 --> 01:38:04,230
I'm just doubting that you are.

886
01:38:04,361 --> 01:38:07,924
I think if you saw a chance to get out
from under you'd unload this place.

887
01:38:08,011 --> 01:38:11,922
This place? This place happens
to be my only world.

888
01:38:12,009 --> 01:38:14,921
I grew up in that house.
I had a very happy childhood.

889
01:38:15,007 --> 01:38:17,659
My mother and I
were more than happy.

890
01:39:19,497 --> 01:39:21,888
You look frightened. Have I been
saying something frightening?

891
01:39:21,974 --> 01:39:23,887
I don't know
what you've been saying.

892
01:39:23,974 --> 01:39:27,103
I've been talking about your mother,
about your motel.

893
01:39:27,189 --> 01:39:29,363
- How you gonna do it?
- Do what?

894
01:39:29,449 --> 01:39:32,187
Buy a new one in a new town where you
won't have to hide your mother.

895
01:39:32,274 --> 01:39:35,142
Why don't you just get in
your car and drive away?

896
01:39:35,229 --> 01:39:39,097
Where will you get the money to do that?
Or do you already have it socked away?

897
01:39:39,227 --> 01:39:42,443
- Shut up!
- A lot of it. Forty thousand dollars.

898
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:49,396
I bet your mother knows where the money
is and what you did to get it.

899
01:39:49,483 --> 01:39:53,177
I think
she'll tell us.

900
01:39:53,263 --> 01:39:56,871
Where's that girl you came here with?
Where is she?

901
01:41:01,708 --> 01:41:04,055
Mrs Bates, it's...

902
01:41:23,524 --> 01:41:27,652
Norman Bates!

903
01:41:55,942 --> 01:41:59,593
If anyone gets any answers
it'll be the psychiatrist.

904
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:02,374
Even I couldn't get to Norman
and he knows me.

905
01:42:02,461 --> 01:42:04,460
- You warm enough, miss?
- Yes.

906
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:08,415
Did he talk
to you?

907
01:42:08,458 --> 01:42:11,370
No.

908
01:42:11,457 --> 01:42:16,498
I got the whole story, but not from
Norman. I got it from his "mother. "

909
01:42:17,758 --> 01:42:21,322
Norman Bates
no longer exists.

910
01:42:21,409 --> 01:42:24,103
He only half-existed
to begin with.

911
01:42:24,190 --> 01:42:28,274
And now the other half
has taken over...

912
01:42:28,362 --> 01:42:30,926
probably for all time.

913
01:42:32,664 --> 01:42:34,663
Did he kill my sister?

914
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:38,270
Yes... and no.

915
01:42:38,357 --> 01:42:41,008
Now look, if you're trying to lay
some psychiatric groundwork...

916
01:42:41,095 --> 01:42:43,789
for some sort of plea
this fellow would like to cop...

917
01:42:43,876 --> 01:42:46,961
A psychiatrist
doesn't lay the groundwork.

918
01:42:47,048 --> 01:42:49,438
He merely tries
to explain it.

919
01:42:49,525 --> 01:42:52,524
- But my sister is...
- Yes.

920
01:42:54,870 --> 01:42:59,477
Yes, I'm sorry.
The private investigator too.

921
01:42:59,564 --> 01:43:03,388
If you drag that swamp somewhere in
the vicinity of the motel, you'll...

922
01:43:07,386 --> 01:43:10,254
Uh, have you any unsolved
missing persons cases on your books?

923
01:43:10,342 --> 01:43:13,513
- Yes, two.
- Young girls?

924
01:43:13,601 --> 01:43:16,642
- Did he confess to...
- Like I said...

925
01:43:16,730 --> 01:43:18,642
the "mother. "

926
01:43:20,467 --> 01:43:24,464
To understand it the way I understood
it, hearing it from the "mother"...

927
01:43:24,595 --> 01:43:28,115
that is from the "mother" half
of Norman's mind...

928
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:31,157
you have to go back
ten years...

929
01:43:31,244 --> 01:43:33,721
to the time when Norman murdered
his mother and her lover.

930
01:43:33,851 --> 01:43:38,893
He was already dangerously disturbed,
had been since his father died.

931
01:43:40,588 --> 01:43:45,193
His mother was
a clinging, demanding woman...

932
01:43:45,281 --> 01:43:49,192
and for years the two of them lived as
if there was no one else in the world.

933
01:43:50,713 --> 01:43:53,190
Then she met a man...

934
01:43:53,276 --> 01:43:57,709
and it seemed to Norman that
she threw him over for this man.

935
01:43:57,797 --> 01:44:01,186
That pushed him over the line
and he killed them both.

936
01:44:01,273 --> 01:44:05,445
Matricide is probably the most
unbearable crime of all...

937
01:44:07,314 --> 01:44:11,181
most unbearable
to the son who commits it.

938
01:44:11,268 --> 01:44:16,613
So he had to erase the crime,
at least in his own mind.

939
01:44:19,003 --> 01:44:21,480
He stole her corpse.

940
01:44:23,349 --> 01:44:26,434
A weighted coffin
was buried.

941
01:44:26,521 --> 01:44:29,389
He hid the body
in the fruit cellar...

942
01:44:29,477 --> 01:44:32,562
even treated it to keep it
as well as it would keep.

943
01:44:32,648 --> 01:44:35,430
And that still
wasn't enough.

944
01:44:35,517 --> 01:44:39,255
She was there...
but she was a corpse.

945
01:44:41,774 --> 01:44:44,556
So he began to think
and speak for her...

946
01:44:44,643 --> 01:44:47,685
give her half his life,
so to speak.

947
01:44:47,771 --> 01:44:52,378
At times he could be both personalities,
carry on conversations.

948
01:44:52,465 --> 01:44:56,767
At other times, the "mother" half
took over completely.

949
01:44:56,855 --> 01:45:01,418
He was never all Norman,
but he was often only "Mother"...

950
01:45:03,199 --> 01:45:06,763
and because he was so
pathologically jealous of her...

951
01:45:06,849 --> 01:45:09,501
he assumed that she
was as jealous of him.

952
01:45:09,587 --> 01:45:14,889
Theref ore, if he felt a strong
attraction to any other woman...

953
01:45:14,976 --> 01:45:18,669
the "mother" side of him
would go wild.

954
01:45:21,016 --> 01:45:23,972
When he met your sister...

955
01:45:24,058 --> 01:45:26,622
he was touched by her,
aroused by her.

956
01:45:26,710 --> 01:45:29,490
He wanted her.

957
01:45:29,578 --> 01:45:33,445
That set off the jealous "mother"
and "Mother" killed the girl.

958
01:45:36,096 --> 01:45:40,399
After the murder Norman returned
as if from a deep sleep...

959
01:45:40,485 --> 01:45:44,179
and, like a dutiful son, covered up
all traces of the crime...

960
01:45:44,310 --> 01:45:46,656
he was convinced
his "mother" had committed!

961
01:45:46,743 --> 01:45:49,220
Why was he...
dressed like that?

962
01:45:49,307 --> 01:45:52,175
He's a transvestite.

963
01:45:52,262 --> 01:45:54,913
Uh, not exactly.

964
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,563
A man who dresses in women's clothing
in order to achieve a sexual change...

965
01:45:58,651 --> 01:46:00,867
or satisf action,
is a transvestite.

966
01:46:00,953 --> 01:46:05,169
But in Norman's case, he was simply
doing everything possible...

967
01:46:05,256 --> 01:46:08,471
to keep alive the illusion
of his mother being alive.

968
01:46:09,905 --> 01:46:12,948
And when reality
came to close...

969
01:46:13,034 --> 01:46:16,598
when danger or desire
threatened that illusion...

970
01:46:18,988 --> 01:46:22,030
he dressed up, even to
a cheap wig he bought.

971
01:46:22,117 --> 01:46:26,071
He'd walk about the house,
sit in her chair, speak in her voice.

972
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:28,375
He tried to be
his mother.

973
01:46:29,982 --> 01:46:33,111
And, uh, now he is.

974
01:46:33,199 --> 01:46:38,196
That's what I meant when I said
I got the story from the "mother. "

975
01:46:38,283 --> 01:46:42,194
You see, when the mind
houses two personalities...

976
01:46:42,281 --> 01:46:45,801
there's always
a conflict, a battle.

977
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:49,538
In Norman's case,
the battle is over...

978
01:46:49,626 --> 01:46:51,754
and the dominant personality
has won.

979
01:46:51,842 --> 01:46:55,926
And the $40,000?
Who got that?

980
01:46:56,014 --> 01:46:59,751
The swamp. These were
crimes of passion, not profit.

981
01:47:01,532 --> 01:47:04,227
He feels a little chill.
Can I bring him this blanket?

982
01:47:05,574 --> 01:47:07,529
- Oh, sure.
- All right.

983
01:47:20,132 --> 01:47:22,522
Thank you.

984
01:47:29,171 --> 01:47:32,127
It's sad when
a mother has to speak the words...

985
01:47:32,213 --> 01:47:34,473
that condemn her own son...

986
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:38,341
but I couldn't allow them
to believe that I would commit murder.

987
01:47:38,427 --> 01:47:42,817
They'll put him away now,
as I should have years ago.

988
01:47:42,904 --> 01:47:45,772
He was always bad,
and in the end...

989
01:47:45,858 --> 01:47:50,335
he intended to tell them I killed
those girls and that man...

990
01:47:50,421 --> 01:47:54,072
as if I could do anything
except sit and stare...

991
01:47:54,159 --> 01:47:57,158
like one
of his stuffed birds.

992
01:47:57,244 --> 01:48:00,764
They know I can't even
move a finger, and I won't.

993
01:48:00,895 --> 01:48:06,457
I'll just sit here and be quiet,
just in case they do suspect me.

994
01:48:09,499 --> 01:48:13,280
They're probably watching me.
Well, let them.

995
01:48:13,367 --> 01:48:17,147
Let them see
what kind of a person I am.

996
01:48:17,235 --> 01:48:19,538
I'm not even
gonna swat that fly.

997
01:48:19,624 --> 01:48:23,014
I hope they are watching.
They'll see.

998
01:48:23,102 --> 01:48:25,013
They'll see
and they'll know...

999
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:30,794
and they'll say, "Why, she
wouldn't even harm a fly. "
