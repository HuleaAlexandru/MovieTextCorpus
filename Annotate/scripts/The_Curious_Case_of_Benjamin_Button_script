{DIALOGUE}: She gave her life for me... And for that I am forever grateful...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Thomas, still holding her hand, is unable to let go... When we hear again the BABY CRYING... The BABY'S CRY is not quite right... It is not an infant's cry for succor, or a natural cry to exercise its new lungs... It's a deep, haunting cry from some primal soul... They all turn, and the room stills... listening as The BABY continues its mournful WAIL.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Only Thomas goes to answer... The Baby in a basket, swaddled in a thick blanket, its face covered with cloth... Thomas goes to lift it, to see his son's face...

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes out every last dollar he has, tucking the money inside the Baby's blanket... We can just see the figures of two people coming from inside...
