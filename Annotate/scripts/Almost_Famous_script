{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A closer shot on William now watching the whirlwind of anarchy inside.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 22 EXT. RADIO STATION -- DAY -- LATER
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bangs walks with William on this sharply inclined San Diego street.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's early, the streets are silent.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bangs is about fifteen beer pounds overweight.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His jeans are loose, his paleness and messy moustache an emblem of the long days and nights spent writing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In there somewhere is a good-looking guy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His hands are thrust deeply into his pockets, and he takes big sweeping steps.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BANGS
{DIALOGUE}: So you're the one who's been sending me those articles from your school newspaper -

{DIALOGUE}: What are you like the star of your school?

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The kid nods, they walk.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BANGS (cont'd)
{DIALOGUE}: Well, your writing is damn good.

{DIALOGUE}: Over.
{DIALOGUE}: You got here just in time for the death rattle, the last gasp, the last grope.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{DIALOGUE}: Well.
{DIALOGUE}: At least I'm here for that.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bangs looks at the much smaller kid, shaking his head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's too late for newcomers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But if the kid's age is an issue, he doesn't mention it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Like a machine-gun:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BANGS
{DIALOGUE}: What do you type on?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{DIALOGUE}: Smith-Corona Galaxis Deluxe.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BANGS
{DIALOGUE}: You like the new Lou Reed?

{META_DATA}: (automatic)
{DIALOGUE}: The early stuff.
{DIALOGUE}: The new stuff, he's trying to be Bowie, he should be himself.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{META_DATA}: (standing his ground)
{DIALOGUE}: If you like Lou.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BANGS
{DIALOGUE}: Take drugs?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BANGS
{DIALOGUE}: Smart kid.
{DIALOGUE}: I used to do speed and sometimes Nyquil and stay up all night writing and writing, like 25 pages of dribble about, you know, the Guess Who, or Coltrane, just to write, you know, with the music blasting...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{DIALOGUE}: Me too.
{DIALOGUE}: The writing part...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For a moment, the serious demeanor dissolves and the oddest thing happens.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bangs laughs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's an odd and charming laugh, the kind a tough guy keeps well-hidden.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It surprised the kid, who smiles back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bangs stops at the corner, and offers a pleasant but very final nod of the head.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BANGS
{DIALOGUE}: Well, alright.
{DIALOGUE}: It's been nice to meet you.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His face is an open book filling with words.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BANGS

{DIALOGUE}: The bands!
{DIALOGUE}: You got an honest face, they're gonna tell you everything.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The kid takes out a green collegiate notebook and gestures -- can I make a note?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bangs nods.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BANGS (cont'd)
{DIALOGUE}: Cannot make friends with the rock stars.
{META_DATA}: (savage bite)
{DIALOGUE}: That's what's important.
{DIALOGUE}: If you're a rock journalist, a true journalist -- first you will never get paid much.
{DIALOGUE}: But you will get free records from the record company.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The kid's eyes widen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bangs, in direct conflict with his brutal writing style, is looking suspiciously like a compassionate softie.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BANGS (cont'd)
{DIALOGUE}: And they'll buy you drinks, you'll meet girls... they'll try to fly you places for free....
{DIALOGUE}: offer you drugs... I know.
{DIALOGUE}: It sounds great.
{DIALOGUE}: But they are not your friends.
{DIALOGUE}: These are people who want you to write sanctimonious stories about the genius of the rock stars and they will ruin rock and roll and strangle everything we love about it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Privately, William thrills.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Our.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It all sounds great to him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He listens to the grouping of the words, every one of them.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: BANGS (cont'd)
{DIALOGUE}: They are trying to buy respectability for a form that is gloriously and righteously -
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The kid leans forward as Lester finds the right word.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BANGS (cont'd)
{DIALOGUE}: - dumb!
{DIALOGUE}: And you're smart enough to know that.
{DIALOGUE}: And the day it ceases to be dumb is the day it ceases to be real.
{DIALOGUE}: Right?
{DIALOGUE}: And then it will just Become an Industry of Cool.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{DIALOGUE}: ... Industry... of... cool...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BANGS
{DIALOGUE}: And that's what they want!
{DIALOGUE}: And it's happening right now.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm telling you, you're coming along at a very dangerous time for rock and roll.
{DIALOGUE}: The war is over.
{DIALOGUE}: They won.
{DIALOGUE}: 99% of what passes for rock now... SILENCE is much more compelling.
{DIALOGUE}: It's over.
{DIALOGUE}: I think you should turn around and go back and be... a lawyer or something... but I can see from your face that you won't.
{DIALOGUE}: I can pay you thirty-five bucks.
{DIALOGUE}: Gimme a thousand words on Black Sabbath.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{META_DATA}: (attempting cool)

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The thundering arena sound of the collecting crowd, the p.a. system blasting Yes' "Roundabout"... purposeful roadies carrying guitar cases... the glimpse of backstage rock and roll... everything he wants to be a part of is on the other side of this door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then it shuts.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{DIALOGUE}: Okay.
{DIALOGUE}: Okay.
{DIALOGUE}: I could do that.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JEFF
{DIALOGUE}: You guys never listened to our records.
{DIALOGUE}: You're all just frustrated musicians.
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know what your magazine SAID about us?
{DIALOGUE}: What was it - "the singer's incessant cater walling distracts From an assault with no clear purpose."
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LARRY
{META_DATA}: (in background)
{DIALOGUE}: That was Rolling Stone.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSSELL
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: Okay.
{DIALOGUE}: Fuck off anyway.

{DIALOGUE}: Russell.
{DIALOGUE}: Jeff.
{DIALOGUE}: Ed.
{DIALOGUE}: Larry.
{META_DATA}: (can't help it)
{DIALOGUE}: I really love your band.
{DIALOGUE}: I think the song "Fever Dog" is a big step forward for you guys.
{DIALOGUE}: I think you guys producing it yourselves, instead of Glyn Johns, was the right thing to do.
{DIALOGUE}: And the guitar sound was incendiary.
{META_DATA}: (gestures with fist)
{DIALOGUE}: Way to go.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns and leaves, beginning his long trek back up the ramp.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Russell looks at the others.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSSELL

{DIALOGUE}: He's not with you.
{DIALOGUE}: He's not with them.
{DIALOGUE}: He's not on the list.
{DIALOGUE}: He's not coming in.
{DIALOGUE}: And this is my arena.
{DIALOGUE}: And furthermore -
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Russel craves the confrontation and moves forward closer to Scotty.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{DIALOGUE}: I do.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSSELL
{DIALOGUE}: The more popular we get, the more I can't walk on them, the bigger their houses get, the more pressure... you forget, man.
{DIALOGUE}: You forget what it was like to be real, to be a fan.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: PENNY
{DIALOGUE}: Here's the thing about Russell.
{DIALOGUE}: He's my last project.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSSELL
{DIALOGUE}: Here we go.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William watches as Russell fishes the t-shirt out of the trash.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSSELL (cont'd)
{DIALOGUE}: Here.
{DIALOGUE}: Take it.
{DIALOGUE}: You LOVE this shirt - it lets you say everything you want to say.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JEFF
{DIALOGUE}: Oh yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: All the time.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The kid looks down.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JEFF (cont'd)
{DIALOGUE}: This is big stuff, man.
{DIALOGUE}: From the very beginning -- we said -- I'm the front man and you're the guitarist with mystique.
{DIALOGUE}: That's the dynamic we agreed on -- Page, Plant... Mick, Keith.
{DIALOGUE}: But somehow it's all turning around.
{DIALOGUE}: We have got to control what's happening to us.
{DIALOGUE}: There's a responsibility here -
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSSELL
{DIALOGUE}: Excuse me, but didn't we all get into this to avoid responsibility?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JEFF
{DIALOGUE}: Forgive me.
{META_DATA}: (continuing, on shirt)

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JEFF (cont'd)
{DIALOGUE}: I can't say anymore with a writer here.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JEFF
{META_DATA}: (eyes suddenly moist)
{DIALOGUE}: I works as hard or harder than anybody on that stage.

{DIALOGUE}: I get people off.
{DIALOGUE}: I look for the guy who isn't getting off, and I make him get off.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Actually, that you can print.

{DIALOGUE}: You are not "cool."
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{DIALOGUE}: I know.
{DIALOGUE}: Even when I though I was, I knew I wasn't.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LESTER BANGS
{DIALOGUE}: That's because we are uncool!
{DIALOGUE}: And while women will always be a problem for guys like us, most of the great art in the world is about that very problem.
{DIALOGUE}: Good-looking people have no spine!
{DIALOGUE}: Their art never lasts!
{DIALOGUE}: They get the girls, but we're smarter.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{DIALOGUE}: I can really see that now.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LESTER BANGS
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, great art is about conflict and pain and guilt and longing and love disguised as sex, and sex disguised as love... and let's face it, you got a big head start.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILLIAM
{DIALOGUE}: I'm glad you were home.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LESTER BANGS

{CHARACTER_NAME}: TONY
{DIALOGUE}: What did he write about?
{DIALOGUE}: What's he using?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JEFF
{DIALOGUE}: It.

{DIALOGUE}: He's using it all.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSSELL
{DIALOGUE}: So what?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JEFF
{DIALOGUE}: So what?
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: We come off like amateurs... some average band... trying to come to grips, jealous and fighting and breaking up - we're buffoons!

{DIALOGUE}: Maybe we just don't see ourselves the way we really are.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JEFF
{DIALOGUE}: He was supposed to be our friend.

{DIALOGUE}: I told him to write what he wanted.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JEFF
{DIALOGUE}: They used him to fuck us.

{META_DATA}: (nervously)
{DIALOGUE}: How about the plane flight?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DICK
{DIALOGUE}: It's all in there.
{DIALOGUE}: But don't worry, it's all unspecific who say what.
{DIALOGUE}: No names are mentioned in the more embarrassing sequences, it's just completely obvious who's who!
{DIALOGUE}: We're fucked!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Silence.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSSELL
{DIALOGUE}: I forgot he was there.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DENNIS HOPE
{DIALOGUE}: Well, they haven't talked to Russell - he can always deny the key stuff to the fact checker.
{DIALOGUE}: Then they can't print it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JEFF
{META_DATA}: (brightening)
{DIALOGUE}: Is that true?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DENNIS HOPE

{DIALOGUE}: The band just denied 90% of the story.
{DIALOGUE}: It's a fabrication.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everyone looks at William, who is speechless and confused.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Their congratulations stop on a dime.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The fact checker can't resist twisting the knife a little.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FACT CHECKER (cont'd)
{DIALOGUE}: You weren't honest.
{DIALOGUE}: And worse, you wasted our time.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{META_DATA}: (darkly)

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: William sits there, as only David Felton stay behind, brandishing his cigarette-holder.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He sits down next to the kid.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: FELTON (cont'd)
{DIALOGUE}: Jim Morrison once came to my house and drank a beer.
{DIALOGUE}: The beer is still on my mantle.

{DIALOGUE}: I wanted to be Earnest Hemingway.
{DIALOGUE}: Instead.
{DIALOGUE}: I have Jim Morrison's beer.
{META_DATA}: (shrugs, he's learned to live with it)
{DIALOGUE}: If you didn't make your story up, good for you.
{DIALOGUE}: If you did make it up... good for you.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's unaware.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SAPPHIRE
{DIALOGUE}: You believe these new girls?
{DIALOGUE}: None of 'em take birth control, and they eat all the steak.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She looks sadly at her plate of vegetables.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An ever-sharp mind in last night's clothes, she commands Russell's respect.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SAPPHIRE (cont'd)
{DIALOGUE}: They don't even know what it id to be a fan!
{DIALOGUE}: To blindly love some silly piece of music... or some band so much that it hurts... please, they're all just after the money.
{DIALOGUE}: Shoo --
{META_DATA}: (in their direction)
{DIALOGUE}: Go rob a bank!
{DIALOGUE}: It's more honest!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSSELL
{DIALOGUE}: Is Penny okay?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SAPPHIRE
{DIALOGUE}: The Quaalude Incident.
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, it wasn't pretty.
{DIALOGUE}: She could have died.

{META_DATA}: (shrugs)
{DIALOGUE}: On of 'em saved her life.

{DIALOGUE}: She deserves it.
{DIALOGUE}: Something about that girl brought out the best in a lot of...

{DIALOGUE}: ... pretty average people.
{DIALOGUE}: She deserves it...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Russell stares into his crew meal, nodding a little.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SAPPHIRE (cont'd)
{META_DATA}: (forward thinking)
{DIALOGUE}: ... because something tells me twenty years from now, we'll remember her... and not much else.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dick passes, placing hands on Russell's shoulders, massaging a little.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DICK
{DIALOGUE}: Have a good vacation.
{DIALOGUE}: I hope the band stays together.
{DIALOGUE}: Before it all went down the shitter, it was starting to get really good.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dick claps Russell on the back, and moves on.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns to Sapphire.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSSELL
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not going to blame myself.
{DIALOGUE}: I do make people happy.

{DIALOGUE}: I don't care what happens.
{DIALOGUE}: I don't care if you put us on the cover.
{DIALOGUE}: But you sent us a kid and... and he was a fan.
{DIALOGUE}: And we all made friends with him - absolutely, to get a good story.
{DIALOGUE}: But then we actually liked him.
{DIALOGUE}: We thought he's... show us our lives in some mythic way and I guess... we're not mythic.
{DIALOGUE}: We panicked.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JANN
{DIALOGUE}: You denied most of the story.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSSELL
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, well, here's the problem with the truth.
{DIALOGUE}: It's too true -
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Well, we appreciate the visit.
{DIALOGUE}: The last time an artist came here, it was Buddy Miles and he punched me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSSELL
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not punching anybody.
{DIALOGUE}: I am personally, as of 2 pm yesterday, on a voyage of self-reinvention.
{DIALOGUE}: This is about William Miller.
{META_DATA}: (counting off fingers)
{DIALOGUE}: He lives with us, he lost his virginity, he saw us at our worst, appreciated our best, he saved two lives, including mine... he smuggled about a half-pound of pot into Boston, and we never even told him -
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Nearby, David Felton looks at another editor, raising an eyebrow.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSSELL (cont'd)
{DIALOGUE}: -- we told him too much, we told him everything... He almost died with us over Tupelo... if the band survives him, it'll be a miracle... but you know, he tried to keep up, and that's a journalist to me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JANN
{DIALOGUE}: It's too late.
{DIALOGUE}: We're going with a different cover.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSSELL
{META_DATA}: (immediately)
{DIALOGUE}: Thank God.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But Russell looks around at the numerous portraits if dead legendary rock stars, fixing on the one photo closest to all of them, a very vulnerable-looking Janis Joplin.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A second thought.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSSELL (cont'd)
{DIALOGUE}: You tell me it's too late.
{DIALOGUE}: But I could go back to my hotel room and... and O.D. tonight and something tells me you'd find a way to put me on the cover of the next issue.
{DIALOGUE}: Am I right?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks at their faces.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They cannot disagree.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSSELL (cont'd)
{DIALOGUE}: I'm learning the game.
{META_DATA}: (beat, shrug)
{DIALOGUE}: We fucked up.
{DIALOGUE}: We made friends with him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Next time we'll all be more professional.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSSELL
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe so.
{META_DATA}: (beat, an odd thought)
{DIALOGUE}: But God forbid, the day comes when selling yourself is as important as the music you make.
{META_DATA}: (rueful, to Hendrix on the wall)
{DIALOGUE}: You might have died at the right time, my friend.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 162A EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Russell stands outside, a traveling man with no where to go.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Oddly, and in a way that surprises him, the world begins to speak to him again... little noises everywhere, turning into a music of its own.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's a beautiful and compelling "silence."
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He thrusts his hands deep in his pockets, and takes a breath of life.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His head filling again with the music of the world, he begins to walk down the street.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Very naturally, and quite randomly, he is noticed by young passersby.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They can't help it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks like a star.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They can't quite figure out who it is, but it's someone, and they begin to follow him down the street.
