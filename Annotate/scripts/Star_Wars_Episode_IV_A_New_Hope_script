{META_DATA}: A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls into infinity.
{META_DATA}: It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.
{META_DATA}: During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.
{META_DATA}: Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A tiny silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers from the back of the ship, races through space.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is pursed by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hundreds of deadly laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2- D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way through the shaking, bouncing passageway.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Both robots are old and battered.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of human proportions.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic surface of an Art Deco design.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Did you hear that?
{DIALOGUE}: They've shut down the main reactor.
{DIALOGUE}: We'll be destroyed for sure.
{DIALOGUE}: This is madness!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in the main passageway.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They aim their weapons toward the door.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: We're doomed!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that only another robot could understand.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: There'll be no escape for the Princess this time.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo continues making beeping sounds.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Tension mounts as loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: What's that?
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade Runner.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly a tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make their way into the smoke-filled corridor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with laserfire.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns creating huge explosions.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Stormtroopers scatter and duck behind storage lockers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered arms and faces.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An explosion hits near the robots.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: I should have known better than to trust the logic of a half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages around the two hapless robots.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations who looks much younger than his eighteen years.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His shaggy hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable lad with a prize-winning smile.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is aided by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The little robot appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stands transfixed for a few moments studying the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet above the ground on a magnetic-field).
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He motions for the tiny robot to follow him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Hurry up!
{DIALOGUE}: Come with me!
{DIALOGUE}: What are you waiting for?!
{DIALOGUE}: Get in gear!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and smoke begins to pour out of every joint.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke throws his arms up in disgust.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum madly.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his way into the blinding light of the main passageway.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His face is obscured by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the Imperial stormtroopers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everyone instinctively backs away from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through the Rebel troops.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Several of the Rebel troops break and run in a frenzied panic.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel soldiers can be heard in the distance.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Artoo!
{DIALOGUE}: Artoo-Detoo, where are you?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke- filled alcove.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years old) stands in front of Artoo.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Surreal and out of place, dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little robot joins his companion.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: At last!
{DIALOGUE}: Where have you been?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: They're heading in this direction.
{DIALOGUE}: What are we going to do?
{DIALOGUE}: We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the subhallway.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Threepio chases after him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Wait a minute, where are you going?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo responds with electronic beeps.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - CORRIDOR
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies of his foes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{DIALOGUE}: Where are those transmissions you intercepted?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{DIALOGUE}: What have you done with those plans?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: REBEL OFFICER
{DIALOGUE}: We intercepted no transmissions.
{DIALOGUE}: Aaah... This is a consular ship.
{DIALOGUE}: Were on a diplomatic mission.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{DIALOGUE}: If this is a consular ship... were is the Ambassador?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to his troops.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{DIALOGUE}: Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador.
{DIALOGUE}: I want her alive!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the stormtroopers search through the ship.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She is Princess Leia Organa, a member of the Alderaan Senate.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The fear in her eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: One of the troopers spots her.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Hey, you're not permitted in there.
{DIALOGUE}: It's restricted.
{DIALOGUE}: You'll be deactivated for sure.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo beeps something to him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease!
{DIALOGUE}: Now come out before somebody sees you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding the mission he is about to perform.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Secret mission?
{DIALOGUE}: What plans?
{DIALOGUE}: What are you talking about?
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not getting in there!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps and twangs angrily.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris through the narrow subhallway.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Flames lick at Threepio and, after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky robot jumps into the lifepod.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: I'm going to regret this.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified robots speeds away from the stricken Rebel spacecraft.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHIEF PILOT
{DIALOGUE}: There goes another one.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CAPTAIN
{DIALOGUE}: Hold your fire.
{DIALOGUE}: There are no life forms.
{DIALOGUE}: It must have been short- circuited.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. LIFEPOD
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO

{DIALOGUE}: I've told you kids to slow down!
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. POWER STATION - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been asleep in his lap.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They grumbled as he races through the office, yelling wildly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FIXER
{DIALOGUE}: Did I hear a young noise blast through here?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CAMIE
{DIALOGUE}: It was just wormie on another rampage.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak and Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are playing a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly, handsome boy a few years older than the rest.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His flashy city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics of the farm boys.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A robot repairs some equipment in the background.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Shape it up you guys!
{DIALOGUE}: ... Biggs?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to great joy and emotion.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They give each other a great bear hug.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't know you were back!
{DIALOGUE}: When did you get in?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS
{DIALOGUE}: Just now.
{DIALOGUE}: I wanted to surprise you, hot shot.
{DIALOGUE}: I thought you'd be here... certainly didn't expect you to be out working.
{META_DATA}: (he laughs)
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: The Academy didn't change you much...but you're back so soon?
{DIALOGUE}: Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS
{DIALOGUE}: Of course I got it.
{DIALOGUE}: Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week.
{DIALOGUE}: First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service...
{META_DATA}: (he salutes)
{DIALOGUE}: ...I just came to say good-bye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everyone laughs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out of it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: I almost forgot.
{DIALOGUE}: There's a battle going on!
{DIALOGUE}: Right here in our system.
{DIALOGUE}: Come and look!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEAK
{DIALOGUE}: Not again!
{DIALOGUE}: Forget it.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD - SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Camie and The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: There they are!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain to see something with the naked eye.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Through the binoculars Biggs sees two small silver specks.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS
{DIALOGUE}: That's no battle, hot shot... they're just sitting there!
{DIALOGUE}: Probably a freighter-tanker refueling.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: But there was a lot of firing earlier...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the building in the process.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke grabs them.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Hey, easy with those...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CAMIE
{DIALOGUE}: Don't worry about it, Wormie.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs his shoulders in resignation.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FIXER
{DIALOGUE}: I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here.
{DIALOGUE}: I doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system.
{DIALOGUE}: Believe me Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about Luke's ineptitude.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - HALLWAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad of armored stormtroopers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her hands are bound and she is brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly marching troops.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The sinister Dark Lord stares hard at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEIA
{DIALOGUE}: Lord Vader, I should have known.
{DIALOGUE}: Only you could be so bold.
{DIALOGUE}: The Imperial Senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{DIALOGUE}: Don't play games with me, Your Highness.
{DIALOGUE}: You weren't on any mercy mission this time.
{DIALOGUE}: You passed directly through a restricted system.
{DIALOGUE}: Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.
{DIALOGUE}: I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEIA
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know what you're talking about.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{DIALOGUE}: You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... and a traitor.
{DIALOGUE}: Take her away!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering hole blasted in the side of the ship.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An Imperial Commander turns to Vader.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COMMANDER
{DIALOGUE}: Holding her is dangerous.
{DIALOGUE}: If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{DIALOGUE}: I have traced the Rebel spies to her.
{DIALOGUE}: Now she is my only link to find their secret base!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COMMANDER
{DIALOGUE}: She'll die before she tells you anything.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{DIALOGUE}: Leave that to me.
{DIALOGUE}: Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They stop and snap to attention.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SECOND OFFICER
{DIALOGUE}: Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship!
{DIALOGUE}: And no transmissions were made.
{DIALOGUE}: An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Vader turns to the Commander.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{DIALOGUE}: She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.
{DIALOGUE}: Send a detachment down to retrieve them.
{DIALOGUE}: See to it personally, Commander.
{DIALOGUE}: There'll be no one to stop us this time.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COMMANDER
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, sir.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. SPACE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Imperial Stardestroyer comes over the surface of the planet Tatooine.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jundland, or "No Man's Land", where the rugged desert mesas meet the foreboding dune sea.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The two helpless astro-droids kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily work their way across the desert wasteland.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The lifepod in the distance rests half buried in the sand.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: How did I get into this mess?
{DIALOGUE}: I really don't know how.
{DIALOGUE}: We seem to be made to suffer.
{DIALOGUE}: It's our lot in life.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo answers with beeping sounds.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: I've got to rest before I fall apart.
{DIALOGUE}: My joints are almost frozen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: What a desolate place this is.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Threepio stops and yells at him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Where are you going?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small robot.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Well, I'm not going that way.
{DIALOGUE}: It's much too rocky.
{DIALOGUE}: This way is much easier.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo counters with a long whistle.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: What makes you think there are settlements over there?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Don't get technical with me.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: What mission?
{DIALOGUE}: What are you talking about?
{DIALOGUE}: I've had just about enough of you!
{DIALOGUE}: Go that way!
{DIALOGUE}: You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the direction of the vast dune sea.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns and trudges off in the direction of the towering mesas.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: No more adventures.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not going that way.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant mountains.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - DUNE SEA
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a dune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless miles.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks back in the direction of the now distant rock mesas.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: That malfunctioning little twerp.
{DIALOGUE}: This is all his fault!
{DIALOGUE}: He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand from his joints.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving towards him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Wait, what's that?
{DIALOGUE}: A transport!
{DIALOGUE}: I'm saved!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The bronze android waves frantically and yells at the approaching transport.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Over here!
{DIALOGUE}: Help!
{DIALOGUE}: Please, help!
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Fixer and the others can be heard working inside.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{META_DATA}: (Very animated)
{DIALOGUE}: ...so I cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail.
{DIALOGUE}: I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments.
{DIALOGUE}: As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad.
{DIALOGUE}: Uncle Owen was pretty upset.
{DIALOGUE}: He grounded me for the rest of the season.
{DIALOGUE}: You should have been there... it was fantastic.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS
{DIALOGUE}: You ought to take it easy Luke.
{DIALOGUE}: You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous.
{DIALOGUE}: Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Look who's talking.
{DIALOGUE}: Now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle.
{DIALOGUE}: You've gotten soft in the city...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS
{DIALOGUE}: I've missed you kid.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs.
{DIALOGUE}: It's been so... quiet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS
{DIALOGUE}: Luke, I didn't come back just to say good-bye... I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust... and if I don't come back, I want somebody to know.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke's eyes are wide with Biggs' seriousness and loyalty.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: What are you talking about?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS
{DIALOGUE}: I made some friends at the Academy.
{META_DATA}: (he whispers)
{DIALOGUE}: ...when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join the Alliance...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Join the Rebellion?!
{DIALOGUE}: Are you kidding!
{DIALOGUE}: How?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS
{DIALOGUE}: Quiet down will ya!
{DIALOGUE}: You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: I'm sorry.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm quiet.
{META_DATA}: (he whispers)
{DIALOGUE}: Listen how quiet I am.
{DIALOGUE}: You can barely hear me...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS
{DIALOGUE}: My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: You're crazy!
{DIALOGUE}: You could wander around forever trying to find them.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS
{DIALOGUE}: I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what I can on my own... It's what we always talked about.
{DIALOGUE}: Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service.
{DIALOGUE}: The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side -- the side I believe in.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: And I'm stuck here...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS
{DIALOGUE}: I thought you were going to the Academy next term.
{DIALOGUE}: You'll get your chance to get off this rock.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Not likely!
{DIALOGUE}: I had to cancel my application.
{DIALOGUE}: There has been a lot of unrest among the Sandpeople since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS
{DIALOGUE}: Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sandpeople with one blaster.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off.
{DIALOGUE}: He needs me for just one more season.
{DIALOGUE}: I can't leave him now.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS
{DIALOGUE}: I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important.
{DIALOGUE}: What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?
{DIALOGUE}: ... You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems... it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: It couldn't happen here.
{DIALOGUE}: You said it yourself.
{DIALOGUE}: The Empire won't bother with this rock.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS
{DIALOGUE}: Things always change.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: I wish I was going... Are you going to be around long?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS
{DIALOGUE}: No, I'm leaving in the morning...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Then I guess I won't see you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe someday... I'll keep a lookout.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows.
{DIALOGUE}: I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure... Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BIGGS
{DIALOGUE}: So long, Luke.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the power station.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures fill the air.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he goes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for a moment.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall and a small dark figure darts into the shadows.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A little further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the narrow path.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He manages one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then off again.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller than Artoo.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They holster strange and complex weapons as they cautiously approach the robot.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They wear grubby cloaks and their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be seen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down the trail.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank- like vehicle the size of a four-story house.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They weld a small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot is sucked into the giant machine.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles around the scrap heap.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The narrow beam swings across rusty metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and maimed astro-robots.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end of the chamber.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In the middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various shapes and sizes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Some are engaged in electronic conversation, while others simply mill about.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A voice of recognition calls out from the gloom.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Artoo-Detoo!
{DIALOGUE}: It's you!
{DIALOGUE}: It's you!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain ridge.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - DAY

{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Wake up!
{DIALOGUE}: Wake up!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops, creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights pop on as he begins beeping.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At the far end of the long chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding white light.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the odd assortment of robots.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: We're doomed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A Jawa starts moving toward them.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Do you think they'll melt us down?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Don't shoot!
{DIALOGUE}: Don't shoot!
{DIALOGUE}: Will this never end?
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small adobe block house.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils should be.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, a large burly man in his mid-fifties.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His reddish eyes are sunken in a dust-covered face.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the farmer carefully inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: One of the vile little Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the homestead.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru standing in the main courtyard.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BERU
{DIALOGUE}: Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment for sale with the Jawa leader.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN
{DIALOGUE}: I have no need for a protocol droid.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{META_DATA}: (quickly)
{DIALOGUE}: Sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN
{DIALOGUE}: What I really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Vaporators!
{DIALOGUE}: Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter... very similar to your vaporators.
{DIALOGUE}: You could say...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN
{DIALOGUE}: Do you speak Bocce?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Of course I can, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: It's like a second language for me... I'm as fluent in Bocce...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN
{DIALOGUE}: All right shut up!
{META_DATA}: (turning to Jawa)
{DIALOGUE}: I'll take this one.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Shutting up, sir.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN
{DIALOGUE}: Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you?
{DIALOGUE}: I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN
{DIALOGUE}: You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done.
{DIALOGUE}: Now come on, get to it!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: All right, come on!
{DIALOGUE}: And the red one, come on.
{DIALOGUE}: Well, come on, Red, let's go.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep and starts after his old friend Threepio.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is restrained by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke and the two robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Uncle Owen...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: This R2 unit has a bad motivator.
{DIALOGUE}: Look!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN
{META_DATA}: (to the head Jawa)
{DIALOGUE}: Hey, what're you trying to push on us?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Jawa goes into a loud spiel.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract attention.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He lets out with a low whistle.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Threepio taps Luke on the shoulder.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{META_DATA}: (pointing to Artoo)
{DIALOGUE}: Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition.
{DIALOGUE}: A real bargain.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Uncle Owen...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: What about that one?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN
{META_DATA}: (to Jawa)
{DIALOGUE}: What about that blue one?
{DIALOGUE}: We'll take that one.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged astro-droid for Artoo.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, take it away.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: He really is in first-class condition.
{DIALOGUE}: I've worked with him before.
{DIALOGUE}: Here he comes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Okay, let's go.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{META_DATA}: (to Artoo)
{DIALOGUE}: Now, don't you forget this!
{DIALOGUE}: Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Threepio lowers himself into a large tub filled with warm oil.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Near the battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery with a cord to his face.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Thank the maker!
{DIALOGUE}: This oil bath is going to feel so good.
{DIALOGUE}: I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo beeps a muffled reply.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke seems to be lost in thought as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he slams a wrench across the workbench.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: It just isn't fair.
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, Biggs is right.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm never gonna get out of here!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Is there anything I might do to help?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke glances at the battered robot.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A bit of his anger drains and a tiny smile creeps across his face.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: I don't think so, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.
{DIALOGUE}: Not on this planet, anyways.
{DIALOGUE}: As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: I see, sir.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Uh, you can call me Luke.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: I see, sir Luke.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{META_DATA}: (laughing)
{DIALOGUE}: Just Luke.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Hello.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo beeps in response.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome pick.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping oil from his bronze body.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: You got a lot of carbon scoring here.
{DIALOGUE}: It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Have you been in many battles?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Several, I think.
{DIALOGUE}: Actually, there's not much to tell.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories.
{DIALOGUE}: Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's neck joint.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He uses a larger pick.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good.
{DIALOGUE}: Were you on a cruiser or...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling head over heels.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three- dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being projected from the face of little Artoo.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The image is a rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly lit garage.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEIA
{DIALOGUE}: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
{DIALOGUE}: You're my only hope.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: What's this?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio to translate.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: What is what?!?
{DIALOGUE}: He asked you a question...
{META_DATA}: (pointing to Leia)
{DIALOGUE}: What is that?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice the hologram.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio to translate.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEIA
{DIALOGUE}: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
{DIALOGUE}: You're my only hope.
{DIALOGUE}: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
{DIALOGUE}: You're my only hope.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, he says it's nothing, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: Merely a malfunction.
{DIALOGUE}: Old data.
{DIALOGUE}: Pay it no mind.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Who is she?
{DIALOGUE}: She's beautiful.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEIA
{DIALOGUE}: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.
{DIALOGUE}: A person of some importance, sir -- I believe.
{DIALOGUE}: Our captain was attached to...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Is there more to this recording?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic squeaks and a whistle.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Behave yourself, Artoo.
{DIALOGUE}: You're going to get us in trouble.
{DIALOGUE}: It's all right, you can trust him.
{DIALOGUE}: He's our new master.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts.
{DIALOGUE}: And it's a private message for him.
{DIALOGUE}: Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about.
{DIALOGUE}: Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Obi-Wan Kenobi?
{DIALOGUE}: I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Well, I don't know anyone named Obi- Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.
{DIALOGUE}: He's kind of a strange old hermit.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few moments.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: I wonder who she is.
{DIALOGUE}: It sounds like she's in trouble.
{DIALOGUE}: I'd better play back the whole thing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo beeps something to Threepio.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.
{DIALOGUE}: He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't really heard what Threepio has been saying.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: H'm?
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off!
{DIALOGUE}: Okay.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off Artoo's side.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: There you go.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The princess immediately disappears...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Well, wait a minute.
{DIALOGUE}: Where'd she go?
{DIALOGUE}: Bring her back!
{DIALOGUE}: Play back the entire message.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in embarrassment.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: What message?
{DIALOGUE}: The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A women's voice calls out from another room.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: AUNT BERU
{DIALOGUE}: Luke?
{DIALOGUE}: Luke!
{DIALOGUE}: Come to dinner!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning robot.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and hurries out of the room.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Well, see what you can do with him.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll be right back.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{META_DATA}: (to Artoo)
{DIALOGUE}: Just you reconsider playing that message for him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo beeps in response.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: No, I don't think he likes you at all.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo beeps.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: No, I don't like you either.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - DINING AREA
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke's Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well- used kitchen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls of food and starts for the dining area.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with steaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red grain.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN
{DIALOGUE}: What makes you think that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.
{DIALOGUE}: He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but manages to control himself.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: I thought he might have meant old Ben.
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know what he's talking about?
{DIALOGUE}: Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN
{DIALOGUE}: That old man's just a crazy old wizard.
{DIALOGUE}: Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed.
{DIALOGUE}: That'll be the end of it.
{DIALOGUE}: It belongs to us now.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN
{DIALOGUE}: He won't, I don't think he exists any more.
{DIALOGUE}: He died about the same time as your father.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: He knew my father?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN
{DIALOGUE}: I told you to forget it.
{DIALOGUE}: Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow.
{DIALOGUE}: In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: I think those new droids are going to work out fine.
{DIALOGUE}: In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season.
{DIALOGUE}: And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Owen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN
{DIALOGUE}: You mean the next semester before harvest?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Sure, there're more than enough droids.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN
{DIALOGUE}: Harvest is when I need you the most.
{DIALOGUE}: Only one more season.
{DIALOGUE}: This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands.
{DIALOGUE}: And then you can go to the Academy next year.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN
{DIALOGUE}: You must understand I need you here, Luke.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: But it's a whole 'nother year.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN
{DIALOGUE}: Look, it's only one more season.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: AUNT BERU
{DIALOGUE}: Where are you going?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: It looks like I'm going nowhere.
{DIALOGUE}: I have to finish cleaning those droids.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Resigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Owen mechanically finishes his dinner.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: AUNT BERU
{DIALOGUE}: Owen, he can't stay here forever.
{DIALOGUE}: Most of his friends have gone.
{DIALOGUE}: It means so much to him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN
{DIALOGUE}: I'll make it up to him next year.
{DIALOGUE}: I promise.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: AUNT BERU
{DIALOGUE}: Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.
{DIALOGUE}: He has too much of his father in him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN
{DIALOGUE}: That's what I'm afraid of.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a distant dune range.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in sight.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes a small control box from his utility belt similar to the one the Jawas were carrying.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: What are you doing hiding there?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Threepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in sight.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: It wasn't my fault, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: Please don't deactivate me.
{DIALOGUE}: I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.

{DIALOGUE}: Oh, no!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke races out of the garage followed by Threepio.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead and searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro- robot.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the salt flat as Luke scans the landscape with his electrobinoculars.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: That R2 unit has always been a problem.
{DIALOGUE}: These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.
{DIALOGUE}: Even I can't understand their logic at times.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: How could I be so stupid?
{DIALOGUE}: He's nowhere in sight.
{DIALOGUE}: Blast it!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around.
{DIALOGUE}: We'll have to wait until morning.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Owen yells up from the homestead plaza.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN
{DIALOGUE}: Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: All right, I'll be there in a few minutes.
{DIALOGUE}: Boy, am I gonna get it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes one final look across the dim horizon.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, he excels at that, sir.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - PLAZA
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Morning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of the open courtyard.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The idyll is broken be the yelling of Uncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN

{DIALOGUE}: Luke?
{DIALOGUE}: Luke?
{DIALOGUE}: Where could he be loafing now!
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - KITCHEN
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru prepares the morning breakfast.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Owen enters in a huff.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN
{DIALOGUE}: Have you seen Luke this morning?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: AUNT BERU
{DIALOGUE}: He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN
{DIALOGUE}: Uh?
{DIALOGUE}: Did he take those two new droids with him?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: AUNT BERU
{DIALOGUE}: I think so.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OWEN
{DIALOGUE}: Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there'll be hell to pay!
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - LUKE'S SPEEDER - DAY

{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{META_DATA}: (yelling)
{DIALOGUE}: How's that.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Threepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the wind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far.
{DIALOGUE}: We must have missed him.
{DIALOGUE}: Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{META_DATA}: (brightening)
{DIALOGUE}: Sure.
{DIALOGUE}: He needs you.
{DIALOGUE}: He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Deactivate!
{DIALOGUE}: Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner.
{DIALOGUE}: It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - DUNE SEA - COASTLINE - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: From high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen gliding across the desert floor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly in the foreground two weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: One of the marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle and points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs the gun before it can be fired.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Sandpeople, or Tusken Raiders as they're sometimes called, speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an animated argument.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The second Tusken Raider seems to get in the final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - CANYON
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing tied to a rock.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large as elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, and long, furry, dinosaur-like tails.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Tusken Raiders mount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs and ride off down the rugged bluff.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke, with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands before little Artoo.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses menacingly behind the little runaway.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Master Luke here is your rightful owner.
{DIALOGUE}: We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me about your mission, either.
{DIALOGUE}: You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Well, come on.
{DIALOGUE}: It's getting late.
{DIALOGUE}: I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: No, he's not going to try anything.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic whistles and screams.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: What's wrong with him now?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Sandpeople!
{DIALOGUE}: Or worst!
{DIALOGUE}: Come on, let's have a look.
{DIALOGUE}: Come on.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - RIDGE - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He spots the two riderless Banthas.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Threepio struggles up behind the young adventurer.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right.
{DIALOGUE}: I can see one of them now.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his electrobinoculars.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly something huge moves in front of his field of view.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large, gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Threepio is startled and backs away, right off the side if the cliff.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He can be heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles down the side of the mountain.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in the heart of the local settlers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But Luke manages to block the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced to the edge of a deep crevice.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The sinister Raider stands over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible shrieking laugh.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in the rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the inert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the speeder.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts and supplies in all directions.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly they stop.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then everything is quiet for a few moments.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A great howling moan is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the Sandpeople fleeing in terror.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and leans over Luke.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His ancient leathery face, cracked and weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating eyes and a scraggly white beard.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ben Kenobi squints his eyes as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo makes a slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Hello there!
{DIALOGUE}: Come here my little friend.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't be afraid.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap and begins to whistle and beep his concern.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ben puts his hand on Luke's forehead and he begins to come around.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Don't worry, he'll be all right.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: What happened?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.
{DIALOGUE}: You're fortunate you're still in one piece.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Ben?
{DIALOGUE}: Ben Kenobi!
{DIALOGUE}: Boy, am I glad to see you!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly.
{DIALOGUE}: Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, this little droid!
{DIALOGUE}: I think he's searching for his former master... I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems to be no stopping him.
{DIALOGUE}: He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.
{DIALOGUE}: Is he a relative of yours?
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know who he's talking about?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan?
{DIALOGUE}: Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: I think my uncle knew him.
{DIALOGUE}: He said he was dead.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, he's not dead, not... not yet.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: You know him!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Well of course, of course I know him.
{DIALOGUE}: He's me!
{DIALOGUE}: I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Then the droid does belong to you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.
{DIALOGUE}: Very interesting...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: I think we better get indoors.
{DIALOGUE}: The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke sits up and rubs his head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo lets out a pathetic beep causing Luke to remember something.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks around.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Threepio!
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - SAND PIT - ROCK MESA - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke and Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half buried in the sand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: One of his arms has broken off.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally the mechanical man's systems turn on.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Where am I?
{DIALOGUE}: I must have taken a bad step...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Can you stand?
{DIALOGUE}: We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: I don't think I can make it.
{DIALOGUE}: You go on, Master Luke.
{DIALOGUE}: There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm done for.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo makes a beeping sound.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: No, you're not.
{DIALOGUE}: What kind of talk is that?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Little Artoo watches from the top of the pit.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ben glances around suspiciously.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the air.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Quickly, son... they're on the move.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. KENOBI'S DWELLING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and security.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio's arm, as old Ben sits thinking.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: No, my father didn't fight in the wars.
{DIALOGUE}: He was a navigator on a spice freighter.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: That's what your uncle told you.
{DIALOGUE}: He didn't hold with your father's ideals.
{DIALOGUE}: Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: You fought in the Clone Wars?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: I wish I'd known him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior.
{DIALOGUE}: I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.
{DIALOGUE}: And he was a good friend.
{DIALOGUE}: Which reminds me...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the table.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle with several electronic gadgets attached to it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: I have something here for you.
{DIALOGUE}: Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.
{DIALOGUE}: He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Sure, go ahead.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ben hands Luke the saber.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: What is it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Your fathers lightsaber.
{DIALOGUE}: This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight.
{DIALOGUE}: Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke pushes a button on the handle.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A long beam shoots out about four feet and flickers there.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The light plays across the ceiling.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: An elegant weapon for a more civilized time.
{DIALOGUE}: For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.
{DIALOGUE}: Before the dark times, before the Empire.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke hasn't really been listening.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: How did my father die?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.
{DIALOGUE}: He betrayed and murdered your father.
{DIALOGUE}: Now the Jedi are all but extinct.
{DIALOGUE}: Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: The Force?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power.
{DIALOGUE}: It's an energy field created by all living things.
{DIALOGUE}: It surrounds us and penetrates us.
{DIALOGUE}: It binds the galaxy together.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo makes beeping sounds.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend.
{DIALOGUE}: And where you come from.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: I saw part of the message he was...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful young Rebel princess is projected from Artoo's face.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: I seem to have found it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickers before his eyes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEIA
{DIALOGUE}: General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.
{DIALOGUE}: Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.
{DIALOGUE}: I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.
{DIALOGUE}: I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.
{DIALOGUE}: My father will know how to retrieve it.
{DIALOGUE}: You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.
{DIALOGUE}: This is our most desperate hour.
{DIALOGUE}: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is a little static and the transmission is cut short.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Old Ben leans back and scratches his head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He silently puffs on a tarnished chrome water pipe.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke has stars in his eyes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{META_DATA}: (laughing)
{DIALOGUE}: Alderaan?
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not going to Alderaan.
{DIALOGUE}: I've got to go home.
{DIALOGUE}: It's late, I'm in for it as it is.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: I need your help, Luke.
{DIALOGUE}: She needs your help.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: I can't get involved!
{DIALOGUE}: I've got work to do!
{DIALOGUE}: It's not that I like the Empire.
{DIALOGUE}: I hate it!
{DIALOGUE}: But there's nothing I can do about it right now.
{DIALOGUE}: It's such a long way from here.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: That's your uncle talking.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{META_DATA}: (sighing)
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, God, my uncle.
{DIALOGUE}: How am I ever going to explain this?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Learn about the Force, Luke.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.
{DIALOGUE}: You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: You must do what you feel is right, of course.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. SPACE.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An Imperial Stardestroyer heads toward the evil planet-like battle station: the Death Star!
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black conference table.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around the room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general, is speaking.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TAGGE
{DIALOGUE}: Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable.
{DIALOGUE}: The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.
{DIALOGUE}: They're more dangerous than you realize.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOTTI
{DIALOGUE}: Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TAGGE
{DIALOGUE}: The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as....
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut short and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial outland regions, enters.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is followed by his powerful ally, The Sith Lord, Darth Vader.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All of the generals stand and bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his place at the head of the table.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Dark Lord stands behind him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TARKIN
{DIALOGUE}: The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.
{DIALOGUE}: I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently.
{DIALOGUE}: The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TAGGE
{DIALOGUE}: That's impossible!
{DIALOGUE}: How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TARKIN
{DIALOGUE}: The regional governors now have direct control over territories.
{DIALOGUE}: Fear will keep the local systems in line.
{DIALOGUE}: Fear of this battle station.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TAGGE
{DIALOGUE}: And what of the Rebellion?
{DIALOGUE}: If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{DIALOGUE}: The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOTTI
{DIALOGUE}: Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained.
{DIALOGUE}: This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.
{DIALOGUE}: I suggest we use it!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{DIALOGUE}: Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.
{DIALOGUE}: The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOTTI
{DIALOGUE}: Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.
{DIALOGUE}: Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader's spell.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{DIALOGUE}: I find your lack of faith disturbing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TARKIN
{DIALOGUE}: Enough of this!
{DIALOGUE}: Vader, release him!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{DIALOGUE}: As you wish.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TARKIN
{DIALOGUE}: This bickering is pointless.
{DIALOGUE}: Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational.
{DIALOGUE}: We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The speeder stops before what remains of the huge Jawas Sandcrawler.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke and Ben walk among the smoldering rubble and scattered bodies.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right.
{DIALOGUE}: Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.
{DIALOGUE}: It's just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: They didn't.
{DIALOGUE}: But we are meant to think they did.
{DIALOGUE}: These tracks are side by side.
{DIALOGUE}: Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople.
{DIALOGUE}: Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio are inspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to.
{DIALOGUE}: And that would lead them home!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for the speeder and jumps it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Wait, Luke!
{DIALOGUE}: It's too dangerous.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke races off leaving Ben and the two robots alone with the burning Sandcrawler.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke races across the wasteland in his battered Landspeeder.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Debris is scattered everywhere and it looks as if a great battle has taken place.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Uncle Owen!
{DIALOGUE}: Aunt Beru!
{DIALOGUE}: Uncle Owen!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke stumbles around in a daze looking for his aunt and uncle.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly he comes upon their smoldering remains.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is stunned, and cannot speak.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hate replaces fear and a new resolve comes over him.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. SPACE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Imperial TIE fighter races toward the Death Star.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION CORRIDOR
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Two stormtroopers open an electronic cell door and allow several Imperial guards to enter.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Princess Leia's face is filled with defiance, which slowly gives way to fear as a giant black torture robot enters, followed by Darth Vader.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{DIALOGUE}: And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it approaches Princess Leia and extends one of its mechanical arms bearing a large hypodermic needle.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The door slides shut and the long cell block hallway appears peaceful.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The muffled screams of the Rebel princess are barely heard.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is a large bonfire of Jawa bodies blazing in front of the Sandcrawler as Ben and the robots finish burning the dead.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke drives up in the speeder and Ben walks over to him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there.
{DIALOGUE}: You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: I want to come with you to Alderaan.
{DIALOGUE}: There's nothing here for me now.
{DIALOGUE}: I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Landspeeder with Luke, Artoo, Threepio, and Ben in it zooms across the desert.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The speeder stops on a bluff overlooking the spaceport at Mos Eisley.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is a haphazard array of low, grey, concrete structures and semi-domes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A harsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke adjusts his goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff where Ben is standing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Mos Eisley Spaceport.
{DIALOGUE}: You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
{DIALOGUE}: We must be cautious.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ben looks over at Luke, who gives the old Jedi a determined smile.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several combat- hardend stormtroopers who look over the two robots.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A Trooper questions Luke.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TROOPER
{DIALOGUE}: How long have you had these droids?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: About three or four seasons.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: They're for sale if you want them.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TROOPER
{DIALOGUE}: Let me see your identification.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his ID while Ben speaks to the Trooper in a very controlled voice.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: You don't need to see his identification.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TROOPER
{DIALOGUE}: We don't need to see his identification.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: These are not the droids your looking for.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TROOPER
{DIALOGUE}: These are not the droids we're looking for.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: He can go about his business.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TROOPER
{DIALOGUE}: You can go about your business.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{META_DATA}: (to Luke)
{DIALOGUE}: Move along.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TROOPER
{DIALOGUE}: Move along.
{DIALOGUE}: Move along.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The speeder pulls up in front of a rundown blockhouse cantina on the outskirts of the spaceport.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Various strange forms of transport, including several unusual beasts of burden, are parked outside the bar.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A Jawa runs up and begins to fondle the speeder.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: I can't abide these Jawas.
{DIALOGUE}: Disgusting creatures.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawa away.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Go on, go on.
{DIALOGUE}: I can't understand how we got by those troopers.
{DIALOGUE}: I thought we were dead.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.
{DIALOGUE}: You will find it a powerful ally.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here.
{DIALOGUE}: Only watch your step.
{DIALOGUE}: This place can be a little rough.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: I'm ready for anything.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Come along, Artoo.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow Ben Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The murky, moldy den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At first the sight is horrifying.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over drinks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group of repulsive but human scum.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A huge, rough-looking Bartender stops Luke and the robots.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BARTENDER
{DIALOGUE}: We don't serve their kind here!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's drift.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: What?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BARTENDER
{DIALOGUE}: Your droids.
{DIALOGUE}: They'll have to wait outside.
{DIALOGUE}: We don't want them here.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the Galactic pirates.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He notices several of the gruesome creatures along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder.
{DIALOGUE}: We don't want any trouble.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: I heartily agree with you sir.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the creatures at the bar go back to their drinks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savage- looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with fierce baboon-like fangs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His large blue eyes dominate a fur- covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, and little else.

{DIALOGUE}: Han, Han!
{DIALOGUE}: If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception.

{DIALOGUE}: If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.

{DIALOGUE}: Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.
{DIALOGUE}: In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first.
{DIALOGUE}: Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.

{DIALOGUE}: It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO

{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: I see your point, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: I suggest a new strategy, Artoo.
{DIALOGUE}: Let the Wookiee win.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems frozen in place.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A humming lightsaber is held high over his head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Han watches with a bit of smugness.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: You mean it controls your actions?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Partially.
{DIALOGUE}: But it also obeys your commands.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a "seeker", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae, hovers slowly in a wide arc.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The ball floats to one side of the youth then the other.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's face.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke doesn't move and the ball backs off.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It slowly moves behind the boy, then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood red laser beam as it attacks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It hits Luke in the leg causing him to tumble over.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Han lets loose with a burst of laughter.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: You don't believe in the Force, do you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.
{DIALOGUE}: I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
{DIALOGUE}: There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ben smiles quietly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: I suggest you try it again, Luke.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ben places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers his eyes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{META_DATA}: (laughing)
{DIALOGUE}: With the blast shield down, I can't even see.
{DIALOGUE}: How am I supposed to fight?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Your eyes can deceive you.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't trust them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker into the air.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The ball shoots straight up in the air, then drops like a rock.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits Luke square on the seat of the pants.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He lets out a painful yell and attempts to hit the seeker.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Stretch out with your feelings.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The seeker makes a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the bolt.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original position.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: You see, you can do it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: I call it luck.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Look, going good against remotes is one thing.
{DIALOGUE}: Going good against the living?
{DIALOGUE}: That's something else.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the control panel.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Han and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: You know, I did feel something.
{DIALOGUE}: I could almost see the remote.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: That's good.
{DIALOGUE}: You have taken your first step into a larger world.

{DIALOGUE}: They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.
{DIALOGUE}: They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TARKIN
{DIALOGUE}: She lied!
{DIALOGUE}: She lied to us!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{DIALOGUE}: I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TARKIN
{DIALOGUE}: Terminate her... immediately!

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Asteroids begin to race toward them, battering the sides of the ship.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: What the...?

{DIALOGUE}: It's not on any of the charts.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool in the emergency.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke makes his way into the bouncing cockpit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: What's going on?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: What do you mean?
{DIALOGUE}: Where is it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid.
{DIALOGUE}: It ain't there.
{DIALOGUE}: It's been totally blown away.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: What?
{DIALOGUE}: How?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ben moves into the cockpit behind Luke as the ship begins to settle down.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Destroyed... by the Empire!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.
{DIALOGUE}: It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled alarm starts humming.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: There's another ship coming in.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe they know what happened.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: It's an Imperial fighter.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chewbacca barks his concern.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A huge explosion bursts outside the cockpit window, shaking the ship violently.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A tiny, finned Imperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit window.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: It followed us!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: It's a short range fighter.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: There aren't any bases around here.
{DIALOGUE}: Where did it come from?
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. SPACE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The fighter races past the Corellian pirateship.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: It sure is leaving in a big hurry.
{DIALOGUE}: If they identify us, we're in big trouble.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Not if I can help it.
{DIALOGUE}: Chewie...jam it's transmissions.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: It'd be as well to let it go.
{DIALOGUE}: It's too far out of range.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Not for long...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. SPACE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The pirateship zooms over the camera and away into the vastness of space after the Imperial TIE fighter.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny fighter.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In the distance, one of the stars becomes brighter until it is obvious that the TIE ship is heading for it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ben stands behind Chewbacca.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: It must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. SPACE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The TIE fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship as they race toward camera and disappear over head.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The distant star can be distinguished as a small moon or planet.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Look at him.
{DIALOGUE}: He's headed for that small moon.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The small moon begins to take on the appearance of a monstrous spherical battle station.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: That's no moon!
{DIALOGUE}: It's a space station.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: It's too big to be a space station.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: I have a very bad feeling about this.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, I think your right.
{DIALOGUE}: Full reverse!
{DIALOGUE}: Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The pirateship shudders and the TIE fighter accelerates away toward the gargantuan battle station.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Why are we still moving towards it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: We're caught in a tractor beam!
{DIALOGUE}: It's pulling us in!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: But there's gotta be something you can do!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: There's nothin' I can do about it, kid.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm in full power.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm going to have to shut down.
{DIALOGUE}: But they're not going to get me without a fight!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ben Kenobi puts a hand on his shoulder.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: You can't win.
{DIALOGUE}: But there are alternatives to fighting.

{DIALOGUE}: It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER

{DIALOGUE}: She may yet be of some use to us.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: OFFICER
{META_DATA}: (to Vader)
{DIALOGUE}: There's no one on board, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff.
{DIALOGUE}: It must be a decoy, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{DIALOGUE}: Did you find any droids?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OFFICER
{DIALOGUE}: No, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{DIALOGUE}: Send a scanning crew on board.
{DIALOGUE}: I want every part of this ship checked.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OFFICER
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, sir.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{DIALOGUE}: I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Vader turns quickly and exits the hangar.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ben Kenobi sticks his head out of a third locker.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: I use them for smuggling.
{DIALOGUE}: I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them.
{DIALOGUE}: This is ridiculous.
{DIALOGUE}: Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Leave that to me!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Damn fool.
{DIALOGUE}: I knew that you were going to say that!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Han shakes his head, muttering to himself.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chewbacca agrees.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship, past the two stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TROOPER
{DIALOGUE}: The ship's all yours.
{DIALOGUE}: If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately.
{DIALOGUE}: All right, let's go.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound is followed by a voice calling to the guard below.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN'S VOICE
{DIALOGUE}: Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round of gunfire is heard.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. DEATH STAR - FORWARD BAY - COMMAND OFFICE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In a very small command office near the entrance to the pirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices the guards are missing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He speaks into the comlink.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GANTRY OFFICER
{DIALOGUE}: TX-four-one-two.
{DIALOGUE}: Why aren't you at your post?
{DIALOGUE}: TX-four-one-two, do you copy?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating his comlink is not working.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The gantry officer shakes his head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an annoyed look.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GANTRY OFFICER
{DIALOGUE}: Take over.
{DIALOGUE}: We've got a bad transmitter.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll see what I can do.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing the towering Chewbacca.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The gantry officer, in a momentary state of shock, stumbles backward.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With a bone- chilling howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ben and the robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed as a stormtrooper.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke quickly removes his helmet.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Bring them on!
{DIALOGUE}: I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: We found the computer outlet, sir.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of the city appears on the monitor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He begins to inspect it carefully.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Plug in.
{DIALOGUE}: He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information to the little robot.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After a few moments, he beeps something.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here.
{DIALOGUE}: He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The computer monitor flashes readouts.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations.
{DIALOGUE}: A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ben studies the data on the monitor readout.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: I don't think you boys can help.
{DIALOGUE}: I must go alone.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Whatever you say.
{DIALOGUE}: I've done more that I bargained for on this trip already.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: I want to go with you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: Be patient, Luke.
{DIALOGUE}: Stay and watch over the droids.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: But he can...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN
{DIALOGUE}: They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.
{DIALOGUE}: Your destiny lies along a different path than mine.
{DIALOGUE}: The Force will be with you... always!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps out of the command office, then disappears down a long grey hallway.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head in agreement.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Boy you said it, Chewie.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Han looks at Luke.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Where did you dig up that old fossil?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Ben is a great man.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't hear you give any ideas...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Who do you think...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke goes over to him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: What is it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: He says "I found her", and keeps repeating, "She's here."
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Well, who... who has he found?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo whistles a frantic reply.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Princess Leia.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: The princess?
{DIALOGUE}: She's here?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Princess?
{DIALOGUE}: What's going on?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Level five.
{DIALOGUE}: Detention block A A-twenty- three.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, no!
{DIALOGUE}: We've got to do something.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: What are you talking about?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: The droid belongs to her.
{DIALOGUE}: She's the one in the message... We've got to help her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.
{DIALOGUE}: The old man wants us to wait right here.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: But he didn't know she was here.
{DIALOGUE}: Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not going anywhere.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: They're going to execute her.
{DIALOGUE}: Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured.
{DIALOGUE}: Now all you want to do is stay.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: But they're going to kill her!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Better her than me...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: She's rich.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chewbacca growls.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Rich?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{DIALOGUE}: Rich, powerful!
{DIALOGUE}: Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: What?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Well more wealth that you can imagine.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: You'll get it!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: I better!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: You will...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: All right, kid.
{DIALOGUE}: But you'd better be right about this.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Han looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: All right.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: What's your plan?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders there will you?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Okay.
{DIALOGUE}: Now, I'm going to put these on you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chewie lets out a hideous growl.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Okay.
{DIALOGUE}: Han, you put these on.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke sheepishly hands the binders to Han.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Don't worry, Chewie.
{DIALOGUE}: I think I know what he has in mind.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as Han binds him with the electronic cuffs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Master Luke, sir!
{DIALOGUE}: Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Lock the door!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: And hope they don't have blasters.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: That isn't very reassuring.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and start off into the giant Imperial Death Star.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - ELEVATOR TUBE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Troops, bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio completely.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious glance.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: I can't see a thing in this helmet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away by Han.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN HALLWAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main passageway.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They pass several stormtroopers and a robot similar to Threepio but with an insect face.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At the far end of the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then disappears down a small hallway.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His appearance is so fleeting that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: No one in the hallway seems to notice him.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. DEATH STAR - INTERIOR ELEVATOR - DETENTION SECURITY AREA
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door slides open behind them.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: I did say so before!

{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Prisoner transfer from Block one-one- three-eight.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OFFICER
{DIALOGUE}: I wasn't notified.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There are only three other troopers in the area.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Han unfastens one of Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one of his ear-piercing howls.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He grabs Han's laser rifle.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Look out!
{DIALOGUE}: He's loose!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: He's going to pull us all apart.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Go get him!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke and Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Their barrage of laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser gate controls, and the Imperial guards.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The officer is the last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is about to push the alarm system.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Han rushes to the comlink system, which is screeching questions about what is going on.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He quickly checks the computer readout.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
{DIALOGUE}: Here it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven.
{DIALOGUE}: You go get her.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll hold them here.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke races down one of the cell corridors.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Han speaks into the buzzing comlink.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{META_DATA}: (sounding official)
{DIALOGUE}: Everything is under control.
{DIALOGUE}: Situation normal.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: INTERCOM VOICE
{DIALOGUE}: What happened?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{META_DATA}: (getting nervous)
{DIALOGUE}: Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction.
