{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: AUGUST, 1936
{META_DATA}: FADE OUT.
{META_DATA}: FADE IN:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. A SLUM AREA OF JOLIET - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's a bleak, windy morning, the kind that clears the streets of all but the winos (who carry their own heaters), and the point-men for juvenile gangs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We pick up a solitary figure, Joe Mottola, coming down the street and entering what appears to be an abandoned tenement.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pauses a second to dust his white-winged alligator shoes on the back of his pants leg.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sharply dressed and surrounded by the aura of one who is making money for the first time and broadcasting it on all bands, he seems an incongruity in this part of town.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We follow him up a flight of rickety stairs to a second floor flat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He knocks on the door, is admitted by a cautious doorman.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. NUMBERS SPOT - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly we are plunged into a room of chattering, clamoring people.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is a spot for the numbers racket, a place immune from legal interference, where any sucker can bet on a number between 1 and 1000 in the hope of getting the 600 to 1 payoff that goes to those few who guess right.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The bettors are queued up in several lines before a long table, where they place their bets and are given receipts in return.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Others wait at a cashier's window to pick up previous earnings or to ask for credit.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mottola moves through the crowd to a back room where betting slips are being sorted and money counted under the watchful and somewhat impatient gaze of a Supervisor, an older man named Mr. Granger.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Yankee-White Sox game is heard on the radio in the background.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mottola, noticing that his entrance has aroused little interest, saunters over to the Phone Girl and gives her a little pinch on the cheek.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The girl slaps his hand away, obviously having been through this before.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PHONE GIRL
{DIALOGUE}: Beat it, Mottola.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Granger glances up and exchanges a token nod with Mottola, who plops down in a folding chair next to the radio.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The phone rings.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PHONE GIRL
{DIALOGUE}: 8720...Yes, hold on a second.
{META_DATA}: (calling over to the Supervisor)
{DIALOGUE}: Mr. Granger, Chicago on the line.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Granger is a little apprehensive about talking to Chicago, but takes the phone anyway.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GRANGER
{DIALOGUE}: Yeh?
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. A WATERFRONT PROCESSING PLANT - CHICAGO - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A flabby, bald man named Combs is on the other end of the line.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Visible beyond the door and interior window of his office is a large room, cluttered with tables, typewriters, clerks and adding machines.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This room is the clearinghouse for all the transaction of the numbers game.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All the betting slips and income from the spots are brought in here and processed.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COMBS
{DIALOGUE}: Granger, this is Combs.
{DIALOGUE}: Why haven't we heard from ya?
{DIALOGUE}: Everybody else is in.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GRANGER
{DIALOGUE}: We had a few problems with the Law this morning.
{DIALOGUE}: The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.
{DIALOGUE}: Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COMBS
{DIALOGUE}: You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GRANGER
{DIALOGUE}: Hell yes.
{DIALOGUE}: He does this every year.
{DIALOGUE}: There's nothing to worry about.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COMBS
{DIALOGUE}: Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.
{DIALOGUE}: I don't wanta be here all night.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GRANGER
{DIALOGUE}: Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.
{DIALOGUE}: Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COMBS
{META_DATA}: (not impressed)
{DIALOGUE}: We cleared 22 here.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GRANGER
{DIALOGUE}: Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side.
{DIALOGUE}: How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COMBS
{META_DATA}: (reading off a sheet of paper on his desk)
{DIALOGUE}: They did 14 grand in Evanston, 16.5 is Gary, and 20 in Cicero.
{DIALOGUE}: Looks like you're bringing up the rear, Granger.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. NUMBERS SPOT - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Granger burns inside.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: One of the girls who's been sorting and counting hands him a slip of paper.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GRANGER
{DIALOGUE}: I just got the count.
{DIALOGUE}: We'll put the take on the 4:15.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COMBS
{DIALOGUE}: We'll be waitin'.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Combs hangs up, smiling to himself, proud of the way he gave the needle to Granger.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. NUMBERS SPOT - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Granger storming over to a safe and jerking open the door.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GRANGER
{META_DATA}: (snapping)
{DIALOGUE}: Mottola.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mottola hustles out of his chair.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GRANGER
{META_DATA}: (handing him a bundle of bills)
{DIALOGUE}: Take this up to the city on the 4:15.
{DIALOGUE}: They'll be waitin' for it at the clearing house.
{DIALOGUE}: And don't stop for no drinks.
{DIALOGUE}: You can get a cab down the street.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mottola takes the money and slips it into his inside coat pocket with all the dramatic flair of the true flunky.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: No one would ever guess that he was just an overdressed messenger boy.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. OF THE TENEMENT AGAIN
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mottola emerges from a side entrance into a narrow alley.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He walks briskly down to the end and turns left into a large alleyway; this one connecting two streets.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The alley is deserted save for one scruffy, slovenly dressed young stranger coming toward him from the opposite direction.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The man carries a battered suitcase and seems to be in a hurry.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, Mottola hears shouting coming from somewhere behind him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns around to see a small, weathered looking thief come racing around the corner and down the alley toward him, frantically pursued by a gray-haired black man.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Limping noticeably, the black man manages a few cries for help and then stumbles and falls.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The stranger yells at Mottola to cover his side of the alley, and then readies himself for the arrival of the thief.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mottola just stands there, not the least interested in the exercise of justice.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just as the thief is about to run on by, the stranger throws his suitcase at the little man's legs, sending him sprawling and separating him from the wallet he's been carrying in his left hand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The stranger makes a dash for the wallet and kicks it back to where Mottola is standing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Almost by reflex, Mottola picks it up.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The thief scrambles to his feet and starts back toward his new-found enemy, brandishing a knife.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Both the stranger and Mottola brace themselves for an attack.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The thief, realizing that there are two people to fight, begins to think better of it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is not a young man, nor particularly strong.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THIEF
{META_DATA}: (shaking his fist at the stranger)
{DIALOGUE}: You fuckin' nigger-lover.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll get you for this someday, sucker egg.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mottola and the stranger exchange glances of relief as the thief flees out onto the street and disappears.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The black man, meanwhile, has struggled to his feet and is staggering toward them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He collapses against the alley wall after a few steps.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The stranger rushes over to him, followed somewhat absently by Mottola.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLACK MAN
{DIALOGUE}: The wallet.
{DIALOGUE}: You gotta go after him.
{DIALOGUE}: He's got all the money.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STRANGER
{DIALOGUE}: Don't worry, we got the wallet.
{DIALOGUE}: What happened?
{DIALOGUE}: He get ya with the knife?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The stranger opens the Black Man's coat to reveal a bloody wound at the top of his leg.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLACK MAN
{META_DATA}: (trying to move)
{DIALOGUE}: Give it to me!
{DIALOGUE}: Please.
{DIALOGUE}: I gotta know it's all there!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STRANGER
{DIALOGUE}: You just sit tight, old man.
{DIALOGUE}: We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.
{META_DATA}: (starting to leave)
{DIALOGUE}: I'll call a cop.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLACK MAN
{DIALOGUE}: No, no cops!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mottola has given him his wallet, which the black man now opens, disclosing a fat bundle of bills tied by a rubber band.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mottola and the stranger are amazed by the amount of money.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STRANGER
{META_DATA}: (a little uneasy)
{DIALOGUE}: You wanted by the law or somethin'?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLACK MAN
{DIALOGUE}: Naw, it's okay.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STRANGER
{DIALOGUE}: You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.
{DIALOGUE}: No wonder you got hit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLACK MAN
{META_DATA}: (trying to get to his feet)
{DIALOGUE}: Thanks.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'.
{META_DATA}: (his leg gives way under him)
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STRANGER
{DIALOGUE}: You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLACK MAN
{DIALOGUE}: I gotta!
{DIALOGUE}: Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here.
{DIALOGUE}: I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.
{DIALOGUE}: They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.
{DIALOGUE}: I don't get it there I'm dead.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STRANGER
{DIALOGUE}: It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLACK MAN
{DIALOGUE}: I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STRANGER
{META_DATA}: (hesitates)
{DIALOGUE}: I dunno.
{DIALOGUE}: That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLACK MAN
{DIALOGUE}: He won't know you're carryin' it.
{DIALOGUE}: C'mon, you gotta help me out.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STRANGER
{META_DATA}: (makes up his mind)
{DIALOGUE}: Sorry, pal.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLACK MAN
{META_DATA}: (desperate to Mottola)
{DIALOGUE}: How bout you?
{DIALOGUE}: I'll give you the whole hundred!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STRANGER
{DIALOGUE}: What makes you think you can trust him?
{DIALOGUE}: He didn't do shit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOTTOLA
{DIALOGUE}: Hey, butt out, chicken liver.
{DIALOGUE}: I gave him back his wallet, didn't I?
{META_DATA}: (to black man)
{DIALOGUE}: How far is this place?

{DIALOGUE}: 1811 Mason.
{DIALOGUE}: Put it in Box 3C.
{DIALOGUE}: You won't have no trouble.
{DIALOGUE}: There's five thousand dollars there and here's a hundred for you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOTTOLA
{DIALOGUE}: (taking the bundle of bills from the black man, plus the $100 bill) All right.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll make your drop for you, old man.
{DIALOGUE}: And don't worry, you can trust me.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mottola puts the bills in his inside coat pocket, right next to the numbers money.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The stranger, who has now finished bandaging, watches him do it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STRANGER
{DIALOGUE}: If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLACK MAN
{META_DATA}: (suddenly afraid again)
{DIALOGUE}: What do we do?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STRANGER
{DIALOGUE}: You got a bag or somethin?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLACK MAN
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STRANGER
{DIALOGUE}: How 'bout a handkerchief?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLACK MAN
{DIALOGUE}: Here.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The stranger goes into the right coat pocket and pulls out a wrinkled handkerchief.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STRANGER
{DIALOGUE}: Let me have the money.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mottola takes out the Black Man's five grand and hands it to the Stranger.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He puts it in the handkerchief.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STRANGER
{DIALOGUE}: You better stick that other in here too, if you wanta keep it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLACK MAN
{META_DATA}: (pleading)
{DIALOGUE}: Just hurry, will ya.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mottola pulls out the numbers money and puts it in the handkerchief too.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The stranger ties it all up.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STRANGER
{DIALOGUE}: (demonstrating by slipping the bundle down into crotch) All right.
{DIALOGUE}: Carry it down in your pants here.
{DIALOGUE}: (pulling it back out and tucking it in Mottola's pants) Ain't no hard guy in the world gonna frisk ya there.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOTTOLA
{DIALOGUE}: Thanks.
{META_DATA}: (to the black man)
{DIALOGUE}: So long, partner.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't worry, everything's gonna be all right.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Black Man nods gratefully, but there's still a trace of worry on his face.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mottola trots off down the alley and out onto the street, glancing around cautiously for signs of trouble.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He walks hurriedly down the sidewalk toward the cab stand in the distance.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly the little man with the knife appears out of a doorway about 15 yards behind him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mottola notices him and quickens his pace, finally breaking into a dead run.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We follow him as he dashes headlong down the street, opening a big lead on the guy with the knife.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He reaches the taxi zone.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He hops in a cab and slams the door.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. TAXI - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He jumps in, closes the door, and breathes a sigh of relief.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CABBIE
{DIALOGUE}: Where to?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOTTOLA
{DIALOGUE}: Which way is Mason?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CABBIE
{DIALOGUE}: About 20 blocks south.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOTTOLA
{DIALOGUE}: Okay, go north.
{DIALOGUE}: The Joliet Station -- Fast.
{META_DATA}: Mottola settles back in his seat and starts to laugh.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CABBIE
{DIALOGUE}: What's so funny?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOTTOLA
{DIALOGUE}: I just made the world's easiest five grand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes the bundle out from inside his pants in order to gaze upon his new-found fortune.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He unties the handkerchief.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's full of toilet paper.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mottola looks like he's just been shot.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. ALLEY - DAY - THE STRANGER AND BLACK MAN
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: hightailing it down the street, two newly solvent con artists on the lam.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's hard to run they're laughing so hard.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The stranger chucks his suitcase in a trash can and pulls the real handkerchief out of his pants.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLACK MAN
{DIALOGUE}: Jesus, what a bundle.
{DIALOGUE}: Did you know he was that loaded?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STRANGER
{DIALOGUE}: Hell no, I just cut into him.
{DIALOGUE}: I woulda settled for pawning one of them shoes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As they split off, music begins, and we go into a
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: TITLES SEQUENCE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Done to a driving Chicago blues, the sequence is designed to establish somewhat the milieu of the stranger, known to friends and enemies alike as Hooker.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see the following:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. PAWNSHOP - LOOKING INSIDE - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hooker is getting a radio and well-worn suit out of hook.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's like seeing old friends again.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All pantomime.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. HOOKER'S ROOM - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A shabby little place he rents above a cigar store.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We pick him up in a jerry-built outdoor shower, which he's rigged up on the fire escape.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The rinse water drips down through the landing into the grimy alley below.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HOOKER
{META_DATA}: (singing)
{DIALOGUE}: 'With plenty of money and you-oo- oo, Oh baby, what I wouldn't do-oo- oo...'
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ON THE STREET AGAIN
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: jauntily carrying a magnum of champagne and some flowers, obviously on his way to see someone special.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: IN A BURLESQUE HOUSE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hooker stands in the wings holding the flowers and champagne, watching his date for the evening, a 6'3" stripper named Crystal, do her routine.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Crystal finishes up and comes off the stage.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRYSTAL
{META_DATA}: (tired)
{DIALOGUE}: Hi, Hooker, you gettin' married or somethin'?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HOOKER
{DIALOGUE}: Come into a little dough.
{DIALOGUE}: You wanna get outa here tonight?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRYSTAL
{DIALOGUE}: Can't.
{DIALOGUE}: I got a 10 o'clock show.
{DIALOGUE}: I need the five bucks.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HOOKER
{DIALOGUE}: I'll spend fifty on ya.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Crystal looks at him a second and starts to giggle.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We're pretty sure she's gonna get outa here tonight.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: COMING INTO A POOR MAN'S GAMBLING JOINT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Little more than a reconverted brick basement, the place contains three shoddy, homemade roulette tables.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hooker, accompanied now by Crystal, nods a greeting to the doorman and proceeds to a table where there are already several other people laying their bets for the next spin.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hooker knows the wheel man, an old-timer named Jimmy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JIMMY
{META_DATA}: (glad to see him)
{DIALOGUE}: Hooker!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HOOKER
{DIALOGUE}: How ya doin', Jimmy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JIMMY
{META_DATA}: (collecting bets and paying off the winners)
{DIALOGUE}: Ain't seen you in months, boy.
{DIALOGUE}: Thought maybe you took a fall.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HOOKER
{DIALOGUE}: Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.
{DIALOGUE}: It's all over now.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JIMMY
{DIALOGUE}: You gonna have a go here?
{META_DATA}: (pointing to the betting board)
{DIALOGUE}: How 'bout a ten spot on the line here.
{DIALOGUE}: The 4-9 been lookin' good today.
{DIALOGUE}: Lotsa action on 28th Street down there, too.
{DIALOGUE}: Pay ya 10-1.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Jimmy finishes his spiel, he starts the wheel spinning and drops in the ball.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Betting is allowed to continue until the ball drops from the outer ring into the center.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HOOKER
{META_DATA}: (taking out his wallet)
{DIALOGUE}: Three grand on the black.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jimmy is stunned.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The others at the table, used to dollar bets, look at Hooker like he's some kind of foreign dignitary.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JIMMY
{META_DATA}: (worried)
{DIALOGUE}: You sure you wanna start off that big?
{DIALOGUE}: Bet like that could put a real dent in us.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HOOKER
{DIALOGUE}: I feel lucky tonight.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JIMMY
{DIALOGUE}: Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HOOKER
{DIALOGUE}: Three grand on the black, Jimmy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jimmy wants to argue some more, but the ball is getting ready to drop into the center.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see Jimmy quickly press a hidden lever under the table with his foot.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The ball falls and settles into red 27 with a motion that is not quite right.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The others at the table fail to notice, but Hooker is not fooled.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stares venomously at Jimmy, who knows that Hooker is on to him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JIMMY
{DIALOGUE}: Sorry, Hooker.
{META_DATA}: (making an attempt at levity, in order to explain)
{DIALOGUE}: Good thing that ball came up red.
{DIALOGUE}: Guy could get in trouble around here, losin' a bet that big.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jimmy reaches for Hooker's money.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hooker stops him by putting his hand on it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HOOKER
{DIALOGUE}: Spin it again.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jimmy doesn't know what the hell to do.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He gives Hooker a little head motion to indicate a small window high up in one of the walls.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Behind it, we see a pair of eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, Hooker understands why Jimmy had to cheat him, but it doesn't change his demand.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HOOKER
{DIALOGUE}: Spin it anyway, Jimmy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jimmy is beside himself.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: If he doesn't spin again, Hooker may expose him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: If he does spin, and loses, his management will fire him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pleads to Hooker with his eyes, but it's no use.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jimmy spins the wheel and reluctantly drops in the ball.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This time there is no foot on the lever, and it settles into black 15.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hooker stares at the ball a second and then looks up at his terrified friend.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HOOKER
{DIALOGUE}: Don't worry, pal.
{DIALOGUE}: I knew it was my night.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hooker pushes the money over to Jimmy and walks out of the room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's lost $3,000, but he's still working on a lucky night.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. GAMBLING JOINT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hooker and Crystal out on the street.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRYSTAL
{META_DATA}: (irritated)
{DIALOGUE}: Thanks for the evening, Hooker.
{DIALOGUE}: I can still make the 10 o'clock.
{DIALOGUE}: If you wanna spend 50 bucks on me again, mail it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She walks off down the street.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HOOKER
{META_DATA}: (going into his pocket for more money)
{DIALOGUE}: Hey wait a minute.
{META_DATA}: (he comes up with 30›)
{DIALOGUE}: Aw, the hell with ya.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. THE WATERFRONT PROCESSING PLANT - LATE AFTERNOON
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A late model Ford roars up and screeches to a stop in front of the plant.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Out bursts a carefully-groomed, tight-lipped young man named Greer, who hustles into the plant.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We follow him through a maze of machinery to the service elevator and up to the third floor where we find ourselves in the clearinghouse room we saw earlier.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. PLANT - AFTERNOON - LATE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The working day is over now, and everyone has gone, except for Combs, who sits somberly in his office.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GREER
{DIALOGUE}: They found Mottola.
{DIALOGUE}: He was drunk in a dive in Joliet.
{DIALOGUE}: Never got on the train.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COMBS
{META_DATA}: (aggravated)
{DIALOGUE}: I don't wanta hear about his day, Greer.
{DIALOGUE}: What happened to the money?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GREER
{DIALOGUE}: He lost it to a coupla con artists on his way outa the spot.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COMBS
{DIALOGUE}: How much?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GREER
{DIALOGUE}: Twelve thousand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Combs sits in quiet thought for a second.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Finally:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COMBS
{DIALOGUE}: All right.
{DIALOGUE}: Better get on the phone to New York.
{DIALOGUE}: See what the big mick wants to do about it.
{META_DATA}: (pause)
{DIALOGUE}: I gotta pretty good idea, though.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. AN EXCLUSIVE NEW YORK GAMBLING CLUB - LATE AFTERNOON
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An agitated young man, Floyd, weaves his way through the craps and roulette tables, and hustles up a staircase to a second floor room with a drawing of a snarling tiger on the door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Below the tiger, the word "FARO" appears.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is a large man, of thuggish demeanor, guarding the door, but Floyd gives him a small hand signal and walks right by him.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INSIDE THE FARO ROOM
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In the center is a beautifully-carved wooden table, on which sit a faro board and a dealing box, tended by a stone-faced Dealer, who calls the progress of the game in a continuous abacus-like device that keeps track of the cards which have already been played.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On the opposite side of the table, completely absorbed in the rhythmic appearance of the cards from the dealing box, sits Doyle Lonnegan.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Although is clothes and accessories are those of a wealthy man, there is a coarseness to both his movement and speech which bespeak lower class origins, for which he now has nothing but contempt.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Floyd enters the room and approaches him cautiously, trying hard to make as little noise as possible.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FLOYD
{DIALOGUE}: Doyle, can I see you a minute?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LONNEGAN
{META_DATA}: (not looking up from the table)
{DIALOGUE}: I'm busy, Floyd.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FLOYD
{DIALOGUE}: It's important.
{DIALOGUE}: We had a little trouble in Chicago today.
{DIALOGUE}: One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LONNEGAN
{META_DATA}: (calmly)
{DIALOGUE}: Which one?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FLOYD
{DIALOGUE}: Mottola.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LONNEGAN
{DIALOGUE}: You sure he didn't just pocket it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FLOYD
{DIALOGUE}: No, we checked his story with a tipster.
{DIALOGUE}: He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LONNEGAN
{DIALOGUE}: They workin' for anybody?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FLOYD
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{DIALOGUE}: Could be.
{DIALOGUE}: We're runnin' that down now.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LONNEGAN
{DIALOGUE}: All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.
{DIALOGUE}: Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.
{DIALOGUE}: Get some local people to take care of the other two.
{META_DATA}: (impassively)
{DIALOGUE}: We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. AN OLD BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

{DIALOGUE}: Howdy, Louise.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LOUISE
{META_DATA}: (admiring Hooker in his suit)
{DIALOGUE}: Goddamn, Johnny Hooker, you're a sharp hunky in them linens.
{DIALOGUE}: If you wasn't so pale, I'da sworn you had class.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hooker steps inside and walks right into a big hug from an older black woman, Alva.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Alva has a hat on, obviously just about to go out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beyond her we see the Eirie kid and the Black Man (known from here on as Luther Coleman) playing a game of mah jong on the dining table with a man whose back is to us.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An 11-year-old boy is listening to the radio.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COLEMAN
{DIALOGUE}: Turn that down, Leroy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ALVA
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, Johnny, Luther said you was somethin' to see today.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leroy goes to get his jacket.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He puts a real $100 bill on the bottom, then two inches of cut green paper on top, and then another $100 bill on top of that, so that it looks like he has a whole stack of $100 bills.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The bundle is then bound with a sealed label, like those used in banks, that says $10,000.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see that he has already made several of these bundles.

{DIALOGUE}: Just don't give him more than he asks for.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: LONNEGAN
{DIALOGUE}: You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: LONNEGAN
{DIALOGUE}: And you were gonna pay me back?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HOOKER

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The odds on Bluenote settle down to 8 to 1.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lonnegan makes his way through the throng toward the betting line.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His bodyguards fan out to various positions in the room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The betting crowd itself (known as the "boost") consists of close to twenty people, none of whom, of course are what they're pretending to be.
