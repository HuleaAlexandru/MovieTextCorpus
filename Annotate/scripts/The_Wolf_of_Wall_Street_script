{CHARACTER_NAME}: JORDAN (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: In military terms it's like carpet- bombing -- noisy, menacing and only marginally effective.
{DIALOGUE}: As Stratton brokers you will be laser- guided smart-bombs aimed at high- priority targets.
{DIALOGUE}: You will establish an initial relationship with your clients selling only blue chip stocks -- then and only then will you attempt to sell the pink sheets, where the real money is.
{DIALOGUE}: Now the key to every sale is this:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jordan writes the word "URGENCY" on the board.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JORDAN (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: No one buys stock unless he thinks it's going up and going up now.
{DIALOGUE}: You must convince your client to buy before the takeover happens, before the lawsuit is settled, before the patent is granted.
{DIALOGUE}: If he says I'll think about it and call you back, it's over, you're dead!
{DIALOGUE}: No one calls back!

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JORDAN
{DIALOGUE}: He doesn't know, he needs to think, he's gotta ask his wife!
{DIALOGUE}: The fact is it doesn't matter what the fuck he says!
{DIALOGUE}: If he's already agreed that the stock's going up, then the only real objection he has at this point is he doesn't trust you!
{DIALOGUE}: And he shouldn't trust you, you're a fucking salesman!
{DIALOGUE}: So what do you say?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAX
{DIALOGUE}: Pissing away money?
{DIALOGUE}: That's what motivates you kids?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JORDAN
{DIALOGUE}: I could afford to pay them more, but then they wouldn't need me as much.

{DIALOGUE}: The quaalude was first synthesized in 1951 by an Indian doctor -- that's dot Indian, not feathers -- as a sedative, and was prescribed to stressed housewives with sleep disorders.
{DIALOGUE}: Pretty soon someone figured out that if you resisted the urge to sleep for fifteen minutes, you got a pretty kick-ass high from it.
{DIALOGUE}: Didn't take long for people to start abusing ludes, `course, and in 1982 the U.S. Government Schedule One'd them, along with the rest of the world.
{DIALOGUE}: Which meant there was only a finite amount of these things left.
{DIALOGUE}: No shit, you can't even find `em anymore today.

{DIALOGUE}: It's called a telephone.
{DIALOGUE}: Now I'm gonna let you in on a little secret about this telephone -- it won't dial itself!
{DIALOGUE}: That's right -- until you take some action, it's nothing more than a worthless hunk of plastic, like a loaded M16 without a trained Marine to pull the trigger.
{DIALOGUE}: And in the case of the telephone, it's the action of you, a highly trained Strattonite, a killer who will not take no for an answer!

{DIALOGUE}: But before you depart this room full of winners, I want you to take a good look at the person next to you, because one day in the not-so- distant future, you'll be sitting at a red light in your beat-up old Pinto, and that person's gonna pull up in a brand new Porsche, with their gorgeous young wife at their side.
{DIALOGUE}: And who will you be next to?

{DIALOGUE}: -- that'd be great.
{DIALOGUE}: And if there's anything you can give me just to close out your file, get it off my desk--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JORDAN
{DIALOGUE}: -- sure, get you back to the real criminals --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: AGENT DENHAM
{DIALOGUE}: -- then we could both profit from this little sit-down.

{DIALOGUE}: -- those are friends --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: AGENT DENHAM
{DIALOGUE}: -- to get a sense of the guy who was coming after you?

{DIALOGUE}: Good for you, Jordan.
{META_DATA}: (as he starts to go)
{DIALOGUE}: Thank you for having us.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm absolutely certain we'll see each other again.

{DIALOGUE}: You have a super ride home on the subway thinking about that!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he watches them pull away, seething --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JORDAN (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: He was a numbers guy, a follow-the- fucking-money'er.
{DIALOGUE}: He wasn't gonna come at me through my guys, looking for a weak link and a quick kill.
{DIALOGUE}: He was gonna come at me like an accountant would, the way Ness got Capone, through my books.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: DONNIE
{DIALOGUE}: We have a joke in America.
{DIALOGUE}: "Heaven is a place where the police are Brits, the chefs are Italian, the car mechanics are German, the prostitutes are French and the bankers are Swiss."
{DIALOGUE}: I never got it `til now -- look at those fucking fish!
{DIALOGUE}: Come here, little guy...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SAUREL
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, we have the same joke here.
{DIALOGUE}: Only sometimes the English are chauffeurs and the chefs are French.
{DIALOGUE}: The Germans, alas, are always mechanics; no one wants to grant them more authority than that.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Polite laughter.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JORDAN
{DIALOGUE}: I'm curious about your bank secrecy laws.

{DIALOGUE}: What I'm asking, you Swiss dick, is are you going to fuck me over.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SAUREL (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: I understand perfectly, you American shitheel.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Saurel smiles.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SAUREL
{DIALOGUE}: The only way the Banque Real de Geneve would cooperate with a foreign legal body is if the crime being pursued also happened to be a crime in Switzerland.
{DIALOGUE}: But there are very few Swiss laws pertaining to your "rumored" improprieties.
{DIALOGUE}: Which is why Mr. Azoff's joke is most appropriate: from a financial standpoint you are now in heaven, and we welcome you.
{DIALOGUE}: If the U.S. Justice Department or FBI or SEC or IRS sent us a subpoena, it would become papier-toillette.
{DIALOGUE}: We would wipe our ass with it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everyone's impressed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Except Jordan.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JORDAN
{DIALOGUE}: Unless it was an investigation into stock fraud -- which is a crime in Switzerland.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: SAUREL
{META_DATA}: (now he's impressed)
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, we would.

{DIALOGUE}: Yes!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the meeting wraps up with handshakes, Jordan's V.O. overwhelms Saurel's V.O..
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JORDAN (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: He was telling me to use a rathole.
{DIALOGUE}: Problem was: sneaking a U.S. rathole into Switzerland was a chance I couldn't take.
{DIALOGUE}: What I needed was somebody with a European passport.

{DIALOGUE}: Of course if you ever got in trouble, I'd come forward in two seconds, say I duped you, but even still.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: AUNT EMMA
{DIALOGUE}: Risk is what keeps us young, isn't it darling?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JORDAN
{DIALOGUE}: I like that attitude.
{DIALOGUE}: Promise me you'll spend at least ten thousand pounds per month out of the account, okay?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: AUNT EMMA
{META_DATA}: (chuckles)
{DIALOGUE}: I wouldn't even know how.

{DIALOGUE}: Before I go, there's something I want to remind you all, and that's this -- Stratton Oakmont is bigger than any one person, even me.

{DIALOGUE}: I'll tell you what it is, it's me being a hypocrite.
