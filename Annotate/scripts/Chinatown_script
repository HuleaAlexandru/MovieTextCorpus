{DIALOGUE}: Gentlemen, today you can walk out that door, turn right, hop on a streetcar and in twenty-five minutes end up smack in the Pacific Ocean.
{DIALOGUE}: Now you can swim in it, you can fish in it, you can sail in it but you can't drink it, you can't water your lawns with it, you can't irrigate an orange grove with it.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MULWRAY
{DIALOGUE}: In case you've forgotten, gentlemen, over five hundred lives were lost when the Van der Lip Dam gave way core samples have shown that beneath this bedrock is shale similar to the permeable shale in the Van der Lip disaster.
{DIALOGUE}: It couldn't withstand that kind of pressure there.
{META_DATA}: (referring to a new overleaf)
{DIALOGUE}: Now you propose yet another dirt banked terminus dam with slopes of two and one half to one, one hundred twelve feet high and a twelve thousand acre water surface.
{DIALOGUE}: Well, it won't hold.

{DIALOGUE}: You steal the water from the valley, ruin the grazing, starve my livestock who's paying you to do that, Mr. Mulwray, that's what I want to know!

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Escobar drops the sheet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Escobar and Evelyn move a few feet to one side and whisper, almost as though they were trying to keep the corpse from hearing them.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ESCOBAR
{DIALOGUE}: It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel.
{DIALOGUE}: Could he swim?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: Of course.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ESCOBAR
{DIALOGUE}: Obviously the fall must have knocked him out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Evelyn nods slightly Escobar coughs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A coroner's assistant wheels the body out of the office.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ESCOBAR
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: This alleged affair he was having.
{DIALOGUE}: The publicity didn't make him morose or unhappy?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: OUTSIDE THE CORONER'S
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes has been sitting on a wooden bench, smoking and listening.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At this question, he rises and looks through the doorway.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Escobar sees him, ignores him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Evelyn doesn't see him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: ...Well, it didn't make him happy...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ESCOBAR
{DIALOGUE}: But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{META_DATA}: (sharply)
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ESCOBAR

{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ESCOBAR
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know where she might be?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: ESCOBAR
{DIALOGUE}: You and your husband never discussed her?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{META_DATA}: (stopping, faltering)
{DIALOGUE}: He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.
{DIALOGUE}: We quarreled over her... of course.
{DIALOGUE}: It came as a complete surprise to me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ESCOBAR
{DIALOGUE}: A complete surprise?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ESCOBAR
{DIALOGUE}: But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: A private investigator?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ESCOBAR
{META_DATA}: (gesturing vaguely toward the door)
{DIALOGUE}: Mr. Gittes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: Well yes.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She stops cold.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They look at one another for a long moment.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{META_DATA}: (her eyes on Gittes)
{DIALOGUE}: But I..
{DIALOGUE}: I..
{DIALOGUE}: did that because I thought it was a nasty rumor I'd put an end to...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She finishes, looks plaintively at Gittes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Escobar is right at her back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes says nothing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ESCOBAR
{DIALOGUE}: And when did Mr. Gittes inform you that these rumors had some foundation in fact?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Evelyn looks at Escobar but doesn't know how to answer him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (smoothly)
{DIALOGUE}: Just before the story broke in the papers, Lou.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Escobar nods.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They begin to walk slowly, again have to move out of the way as some other corpse is being wheeled out of one of the Coroner cubicles.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ESCOBAR
{DIALOGUE}: You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ESCOBAR
{DIALOGUE}: Or her name?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They have walked a few steps further down the hall.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ESCOBAR
{DIALOGUE}: I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray.
{DIALOGUE}: Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: I'll walk her to her car, be right back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ESCOBAR'S POV
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Evelyn glances at Gittes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They go through a couple of outer doors and pass several reporters who have been in the outer hall, laughing, kidding, the tag end of lines like "only in L.A." and "Southern Cafeteria."
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes hurries her past the reporters who flank them, asking questions.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes brushes them aside.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: EVELYN AND GITTES – AT HER CAR
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In a small parking lot.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Evelyn fumbles in her bag, looking feverishly for something in her purse.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. CORONER'S OFFICE HALLWAY
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Don't give me that, Lou.
{DIALOGUE}: You hauled me down here for a statement.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: ESCOBAR
{DIALOGUE}: I don't want it anymore.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: No?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ESCOBAR
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: It was an accident.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: You mean that's what you're going to call it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Escobar looks up.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ESCOBAR
{DIALOGUE}: That's right.
{META_DATA}: (contemptuously)
{DIALOGUE}: Out of respect for his civic position.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Resume walking.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes laughs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: What'd he do, Lou, make a pass at your sister?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Escobar stops.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ESCOBAR
{DIALOGUE}: No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people.
{DIALOGUE}: But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam.
{DIALOGUE}: Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Oh yeah?
{DIALOGUE}: Can you think of something to charge me with?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ESCOBAR
{DIALOGUE}: When I do, you'll hear about it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes nods, turns, and walks down the hall.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: OUTSIDE MORGUE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes stops by a body on the table, the toe tagged with Mulwray's name.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MORTY is standing near it in a doorway to an adjoining room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A RADIO is on, and with it the announcement that they're about to hear another chapter in the life of Lorenzo Jones and his devoted wife, Belle.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes picks up the sheet and pulls it back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CAMERA GETS ITS FIRST GLIMPSE of Mulwray's body.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Eyes open, the face badly cut and bruised.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MORTY

{DIALOGUE}: Ain't that something?
{DIALOGUE}: Middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns.
{DIALOGUE}: Only in L.A.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (looking at. Mulwray)
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: So how are you, Morty?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Morty is wheeling in another body with the help of an assistant.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MORTY
{DIALOGUE}: Never better.
{DIALOGUE}: You know me, Jake.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he begins to move the body into the refrigerator, he breaks into a wrenching spasm of coughing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes spots the other body, lowers the sheet on Mulwray.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (picking up on cough)
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, so who you got there?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Morty pulls back the sheet.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MORTY
{DIALOGUE}: Leroy Shuhardt, local drunk used to hang around Ferguson's Alley.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Morty brushes some sand from the man's face, laughs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MORTY
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: Quite a character.
{DIALOGUE}: Lately he'd been living in one of the downtown storm drains.
{DIALOGUE}: Had a bureau dresser down there and everything.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes has already lost interest.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He starts away.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MORTY
{DIALOGUE}: Drowned, too.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This stops Gittes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Come again?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MORTY
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: The L.A. River?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MORTY
{META_DATA}: (a little puzzled)
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes has moved back to the body, looks at it more closely.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: It's bone dry, Morty.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MORTY
{DIALOGUE}: It's not completely dry.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either, I don't care how soused he was.
{DIALOGUE}: That's like drowning in a teaspoon.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Morty shrugs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MORTY
{DIALOGUE}: We got water out of him, Jake.
{DIALOGUE}: He drowned.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes walks away mumbling.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Jesus, this town...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD – GITTES – DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's parked on an overpass.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The sign HOLLENBECK BRIDGE on one of its concrete columns.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes looks down into the riverbed below.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: FROM THE BRIDGE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes can see the muddy remains of a collapsed shack, its contents strewn down river from the bridge.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Below him, lying half over the storm drain and one wall that was on the bank of the river is a sign that proclaims "OWN YOUR OWN OFFICE IN THIS BUILDING $5000 to $6000" which was used as a roof of sorts.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Downstream, there's the dresser, an oil drum, a Ford seat cushion, an Armour lard can, etc.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The trashy remains of Shuhardt's home.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes scrambles down the embankment and as he lands near the storm drain one shoe sinks, ankle deep into mud.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes pulls it out, swearing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He begins to walk a little further downstream when he hears the vaguely familiar SQUISHY CLOP of something.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clearing the bridge on the opposite side is the little Mexican Boy, again on his swayback horse, riding along the muddy bank.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They look at one another a moment.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (calling out to him)
{DIALOGUE}: You were riding here the other day, weren't you...?

{DIALOGUE}: ... Habla Ingles?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THE BOY

{DIALOGUE}: Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Boy nods.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: What did you talk about, mind my asking?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The shadows of the two are very long now.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THE BOY
{META_DATA}: (finally)
{DIALOGUE}: The water.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: What about the water?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THE BOY
{DIALOGUE}: When it comes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: When it comes?
{DIALOGUE}: What'd you tell him?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THE BOY
{DIALOGUE}: Comes in different parts of the river.
{DIALOGUE}: Every night a different part.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes nods.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The horse snorts.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Boy rides slowly on.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. RIVERBED – DUSK
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes scrambles up the embankment to note the direction the storm drain by Hollenbeck Bridge takes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is headed above toward the Hollywood Hills, where the sun is setting.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. GITTES IN CAR – NIGHTFALL
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Winding his way up a section of the Hollywood Hills.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He picks up on an open flood channel with the spotlight by the driver's windwing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: GITTES IN CAR – MOVING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Along the flood channel.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is dark now and Gittes follows the channel with the car spotlight.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns at a fork in the road which allows him to continue following the flood channel.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: FURTHER UP – MOVING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The road is narrower.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes drives more slowly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Foliage is overgrown in the channel so its bottom cannot be glimpsed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: STILL FURTHER – NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The road is dirt.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Heavy clusters of oak trees and eucalyptus are everywhere.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is very still.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Another turn and a pie- shaped view of a lake of lights in the city below can be GLIMPSED.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: POV – CHAIN-LINK FENCE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Over the road, bolted.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It says "OAK PASS RESERVOIR.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: KEEP OUT.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: NO TRESPASSING."
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The chain-link itself actually extends over the flood channel and down into it, making access along the channel itself impossible.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes backs up, turns off the motor, the car lights, the spotlight.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A lone light overhead on tension wires is the sole illumination.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is only the eerie SOUND of the tension WIRES HUMMING.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes gets out of the car, clubs the fence near the Flood channel itself.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ON THE OTHER SIDE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes carefully works his way up through the thick Foliage toward a second and large chain-link fence.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lights from the reservoir still higher above can be SEEN.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly there is a GUNSHOT.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then ANOTHER.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes dives into the flood control channel, which is at this point about four feet deep and six feet wide.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is the SOUND of men scurrying through the brush, coming near him, then retreating.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes loses himself among the ivy in the channel.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He waits.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The men seem to have passed him by.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But there is another SOUND now.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An echoing growing sound.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It puzzles Gittes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He starts to lift his head to catch the direction.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: GITTES IN FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL – NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he's inundated with a rush of water which pours over him, knocks off his hat, carries him down the channel, banging into its banks, as he desperately tries to grab some of the overgrowth to hang on and pull himself out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But the force of the stream batters him and carries him with it until he's brought rudely to the chainlink fence.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It stops him cold.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's nearly strained through it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Swearing and choking, he pulls himself out of the rushing water by means of the fence itself.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Drenched, battered, he slowly climbs back over the fence and makes his way toward his car.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: AT GITTES' CAR
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He fishes for his car keys, looks down.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: One shoe is missing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The smaller man thrusts a switchblade knife about an inch and a half up Gittes' left nostril.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SMALLER MAN
{META_DATA}: (shaking with emotion)
{DIALOGUE}: Hold it there, kitty cat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLOSE – GITTES
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Frozen, the knife in his nostril, the street lamp overhead gleaming on the silvery blade.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THE SMALLER MAN
{DIALOGUE}: You are a very nosey fellow, kitty cat... you know what happens to nosey fellows?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Smaller Man actually seems to be trembling with rage when he says this.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes doesn't move.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SMALLER MAN
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: Wanna guess?
{DIALOGUE}: No?
{DIALOGUE}: Okay, lose their noses.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With a quick flick the Smaller Man pulls back on the blade, laying Gittes' left nostril open about an inch further.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes screams.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Blood gushes down onto his shirt and coat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes bends over, instinctively trying to keep the blood from getting on his clothes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mulvihill and the Smaller Man stare at him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THE SMALLER MAN
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: Next time you lose the whole thing, kitty cat.

{DIALOGUE}: ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: IDA'S VOICE
{DIALOGUE}: Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions.
{DIALOGUE}: That could help us both.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: IDA'S VOICE
{DIALOGUE}: Oh no.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: ...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: IDA'S VOICE

{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: I got your check in the mall.

{DIALOGUE}: As I said, I was very grateful.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLOSE ON EVELYN

{META_DATA}: (coolly)
{DIALOGUE}: I have?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: I think so.

{DIALOGUE}: Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass.
{DIALOGUE}: Excuse me.
{DIALOGUE}: Then you ask me to lie to the police.

{DIALOGUE}: It wasn't much of a lie.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: If your husband was killed it was.
{META_DATA}: (meaning check)
{DIALOGUE}: This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: But he wasn't killed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes smiles.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: I think you're hiding something, Mrs. Mulwray.

{DIALOGUE}: You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: Why?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (a flash of annoyance)
{DIALOGUE}: Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my metiay.
{DIALOGUE}: When a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes looks significantly to Evelyn.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: Unless what?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (looking directly at her)
{DIALOGUE}: She's cheating on him.

{DIALOGUE}: Did you have affairs?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{META_DATA}: (flashing)
{DIALOGUE}: Mr. Gittes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Did he know?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{META_DATA}: (almost an outburst)
{DIALOGUE}: Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{META_DATA}: (continuing; more calmly)
{DIALOGUE}: Is there anything else you want to know?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Where you were when your husband died.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: I can't tell you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: You mean you don't know where you were?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: I mean I can't tell you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: You were seeing someone, too.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Evelyn looks squarely at him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She doesn't deny it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: For very long?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.
{DIALOGUE}: It's difficult for me.
{DIALOGUE}: Now I think you know all you need to about me.
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't want publicity.
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now.
{DIALOGUE}: Is this all?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes nods.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, by the way.
{DIALOGUE}: What's the 'C' stand for?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{META_DATA}: (she stammers slightly)
{DIALOGUE}: K..
{DIALOGUE}: Cross.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: That your maiden name?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: Yes... why?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: No reason.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Evelyn turns into Gittes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: You must've had a reason to ask me that.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (shrugs)
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm just a snoop.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: No, not for that one.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: I don't believe you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes suddenly turns sharply in to Evelyn.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (moving in)
{DIALOGUE}: Do me a favor.
{DIALOGUE}: Sit still and act like I'm charming.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: There's somebody here.
{DIALOGUE}: Say something.
{DIALOGUE}: Anything.
{DIALOGUE}: Something like we're being intimate.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Evelyn reluctantly allows Gittes to move closer and dangle his hand in front of their faces.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She stares at him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{META_DATA}: (meaning his nose)
{DIALOGUE}: How did it happen?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (quietly)
{DIALOGUE}: Been meaning to talk to you about that.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{META_DATA}: (quietly)
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (quietly)
{DIALOGUE}: More like other people putting their business in my nose.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Evelyn actually smiles a little.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WOMAN'S VOICE
{DIALOGUE}: You son of a bitch.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes looks up and flashes his smile.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Mrs. Match.
{DIALOGUE}: How're you?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MRS. MATCH is swaying over the table, a plump woman with a glass of whiskey in one hand, a large purse in the other, and a menacing look in her eye.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MRS. MATCH
{DIALOGUE}: Don't give me that, you son of a bitch.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Okay.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes turns back to Evelyn.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{META_DATA}: (softly)
{DIALOGUE}: Another satisfied client?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Another satisfied client's wife.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MRS. MATCH
{DIALOGUE}: Look at me, you son of a bitch.
{DIALOGUE}: You... you bastard.
{DIALOGUE}: Are you happy, are you happy now?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She tries to take a swipe at Gittes with her purse.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes covers himself.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Waiters rush over.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MRS. MATCH
{DIALOGUE}: You smug son of a bitch.
{DIALOGUE}: My husband's so upset he sweats all night!
{DIALOGUE}: How do you think that makes me feel?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Sweaty?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mrs. Match swings at Gittes again and again.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She catches him on the nose.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It hurts.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He covers it, then swings his leg out from under the table and deftly kicks her in the shin.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mrs. Match drops her purse and spills her drink.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She grabs her shin, hopping around a little.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The waiters who had tried to restrain her now try to keep her from falling over.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Let's get out of here before she picks up her purse.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They rise and move toward the door.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{META_DATA}: (quietly)
{DIALOGUE}: Tough guy, huh?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes looks, sees she's kidding, and nods.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: OUTSIDE IN THE PARKING LOT – DUSK
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes' car has been brought by the parking attendant.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The attendant opens the passenger side for Evelyn.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, no.
{DIALOGUE}: I've got my own car.
{DIALOGUE}: The creamcolored Packard.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: (to attendant who dutifully starts for her car) Wait a minute, sonny.
{META_DATA}: (to Evelyn)
{DIALOGUE}: I think you better come with me.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He talks quietly but spits it out.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Okay, go home.
{DIALOGUE}: But in case you're interested your husband was murdered.
{DIALOGUE}: Somebody's dumping tons of water out of the city reservoirs when we're supposedly in the middle of a drought, he found out, and he was killed.
{DIALOGUE}: There's a waterlogged drunk in the morgue.
{DIALOGUE}: Involuntary manslaughter if anybody wants to take the trouble which they don't.
{DIALOGUE}: It looks like half the city is trying to cover it all up, which is fine with me.
{DIALOGUE}: But, Mrs. Mulwray.
{META_DATA}: (now inches from her)
{DIALOGUE}: I goddam near lost my nose!
{DIALOGUE}: And I like it.
{DIALOGUE}: I like breathing through it.
{DIALOGUE}: And I still think you're hiding something.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She stares at Gittes for a long moment.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he gently tugs the car door closed.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is standing high in the mountains, near a pass.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The caption reads "JULIAN CROSS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 1905".
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cross is strikingly handsome.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes immediately pulls out the envelope containing Evelyn's check.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks at the corner of it, his thumb pressing down under the middle initial C, then he looks back to the photos.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Secretary returns.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SECRETARY

{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Well I'm on my lunch hour.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll wait.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: SECRETARY
{META_DATA}: (looking up)
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (humming, then)
{DIALOGUE}: He did or he didn't?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SECRETARY
{DIALOGUE}: He owned it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes is genuinely surprised at this.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: He owned the water department?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SECRETARY
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: He owned the entire water supply for the city?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: They were partners.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SECRETARY
{META_DATA}: (testily)
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, they were partners.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She gets up, annoyed, and goes into Yelburton's inner office.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes goes back to the photographs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He hears a SCRATCHING SOUND, apparently coming from just outside the outer door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He moves quickly to it, hesitates, swiftly opens the door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Workmen are behind it, scraping away Mulwray's name on the outer door, looking up at Gittes in some surprise.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Secretary returns, sees the workman on the floor.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SECRETARY
{META_DATA}: (to Gittes)
{DIALOGUE}: Mr. Yelburton will see you now.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes nods graciously, heads on into Yelburton's office.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. DWP – YELBURTON & GITTES
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is a subtle but perceptible difference in Yelburton's attitude.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's now head of the department.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YELBURTON
{DIALOGUE}: Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting.
{DIALOGUE}: These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YELBURTON
{DIALOGUE}: Oh yes.
{DIALOGUE}: Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had.
{DIALOGUE}: My goodness, what happened to your nose?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (smiles)
{DIALOGUE}: I cut myself shaving.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YELBURTON
{DIALOGUE}: You ought to be more careful.
{DIALOGUE}: That must really smart.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Only when I breathe.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YELBURTON
{META_DATA}: (laughing)
{DIALOGUE}: Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: I never was.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YELBURTON
{META_DATA}: (stops smiling)
{DIALOGUE}: I don't understand.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Neither do I, actually.
{DIALOGUE}: But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YELBURTON
{DIALOGUE}: Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.
{DIALOGUE}: Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so.
{DIALOGUE}: you decided to ruin it.
{DIALOGUE}: Then he found out that you were dumping water every night.
{DIALOGUE}: Then he was drowned.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YELBURTON
{DIALOGUE}: Mr. Gittes!
{DIALOGUE}: That's an outrageous accusation.
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know what you're talking about.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will.
{DIALOGUE}: Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.
{DIALOGUE}: That's news.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes heads toward the door.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YELBURTON
{DIALOGUE}: Wait.
{DIALOGUE}: Please sit down, Mr. Gittes.
{DIALOGUE}: We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley.
{DIALOGUE}: As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off.
{DIALOGUE}: The city comes first, naturally.
{DIALOGUE}: But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under.
{DIALOGUE}: Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, a little runoff.
{DIALOGUE}: Where are those orchards?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YELBURTON
{DIALOGUE}: I said, the northwest valley.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: That's like saying they're in Arizona.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YELBURTON
{DIALOGUE}: Mr. Gittes, my field men are out and I can't give you an exact location...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes nods.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: You're a married man, am I right?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YELBURTON
{DIALOGUE}: Yes...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Hard working, have a wife and kids...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YELBURTON
{DIALOGUE}: Yes...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: I don't want to nail you.
{DIALOGUE}: I just want to know who put you up to it.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll give you a few days to think it over.
{META_DATA}: (hands him a card)
{DIALOGUE}: Call me.
{DIALOGUE}: I can help.
{DIALOGUE}: Who knows?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Thirty-five bucks daily for me, twenty for each of my operators, plus expenses, plus my fee if I show results.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's sitting now.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Evelyn is very pale now, obviously very shaken.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Money.
{DIALOGUE}: How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: I'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is involved.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes buzzes Sophie.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Sophie, draw up one of our standard forms for Mrs. Mulwray.
{META_DATA}: (he leans back; to Evelyn)
{DIALOGUE}: Tell me, did you get married before or after Mulwray and your father sold the water department?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Evelyn nearly jumps at the question.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, of course.
{DIALOGUE}: It was quite a while after.
{DIALOGUE}: I was just out of grade school when they did that.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: So you married your father's business partner?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Evelyn nods.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She lights another cigarette.

{DIALOGUE}: (continuing; staring at her, points to the ashtray) You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: Oh.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She quickly stubs one out.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: No!
{DIALOGUE}: ... Yes, a little.
{DIALOGUE}: You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Over the water department, or over you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{META_DATA}: (quickly)
{DIALOGUE}: Not over me.
{DIALOGUE}: Why would they have a falling out over me?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (noting her nervousness)
{DIALOGUE}: Then it was over the water department.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: Not exactly.
{DIALOGUE}: Well, I mean, yes.
{DIALOGUE}: Yes and no.
{DIALOGUE}: Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.
{DIALOGUE}: Actually, it was over the Van der Lip.
{DIALOGUE}: The dam that broke.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, yeah?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{DIALOGUE}: He never forgave him for it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Never forgave him for what?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (starts a little)
{DIALOGUE}: You sure shout that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN

{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN
{DIALOGUE}: What are you thinking?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: (picking up one of copies, folding it, putting it in his pocket) Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SEAPLANE

{DIALOGUE}: Ever heard of him?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: PILOT
{META_DATA}: (surprised)
{DIALOGUE}: That right?
{DIALOGUE}: ... She used to be some looker.

{DIALOGUE}: She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PILOT
{DIALOGUE}: She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: You must be thinking of a different daughter.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PILOT
{DIALOGUE}: No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: She ran away?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PILOT
{DIALOGUE}: Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time.
{DIALOGUE}: Julian Cross' daughter.
{DIALOGUE}: God almighty.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: PILOT

{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (smiling a little)
{DIALOGUE}: Well, you never know, do you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PILOT
{META_DATA}: (loosening up)
{DIALOGUE}: That's for sure.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Why'd she run away?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PILOT
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, you know.
{DIALOGUE}: She was sixteen or seventeen.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (nudging him)
{DIALOGUE}: We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Both men laugh a little lewdly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PILOT
{DIALOGUE}: She ran off to Mexico.
{DIALOGUE}: Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was.
{DIALOGUE}: Went there to get rid of it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: You don't say?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PILOT
{DIALOGUE}: Cross was looking for her all over the country.
{DIALOGUE}: Offered rewards, everything.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The seaplane lands.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A motor launch with a burgee of a fish flying from it turns and heads in the direction of the plane.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. WINDING ROAD – RANCHO DEL CRUCE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes, driven in a station wagon, passes under the sign with a cross painted below the name.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The ranch itself is only partially in a valley on the island.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the wagon continues one can SEE that it is actually a miniature California, encompassing desert, mountains and canyon that tumble down palisades to the windward side of the sea.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The wagon comes to a halt where a group of hands are clustered around a corral.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The circle of men drift apart, leaving JULIAN CROSS standing, using a cane for support, reedy but handsome in a rough linen shirt and jeans.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When he talks his strong face is lively, in repose it looks ravaged.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. BRIDLE PATH – GITTES & CROSS
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Walking toward the main house.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A classic Monterey.

{DIALOGUE}: Sir?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: I said horseshit.
{META_DATA}: (pointing)
{DIALOGUE}: Horseshit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, sir, that's what it looks like.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll give you that.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cross pauses when they reach the dung pile.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He removes his hat and waves it, inhales deeply.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: Love the smell of it.
{DIALOGUE}: A lot of people do but of course they won't admit it.
{DIALOGUE}: Look at the shape.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes glances down out of politeness.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{META_DATA}: (continuing; smiling, almost enthusiastic)
{DIALOGUE}: Always the same.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cross walks on.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes follows.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (not one to let it go)
{DIALOGUE}: Always?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: What?
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, damn near yes.
{DIALOGUE}: Unless the animal's sick or something.
{META_DATA}: (stops and glances. back)
{DIALOGUE}: And the steam rising off it like that in the morning.
{DIALOGUE}: That's life, Mr. Gittes.
{DIALOGUE}: Life.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They move on.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: Perhaps this preoccupation with horseshit may seem a little perverse, but I ask you to remember this.
{DIALOGUE}: One way or another, it's what I've dealt in all my life.
{DIALOGUE}: Let's have breakfast.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. COURTYARD VERANDA – GITTES & CROSS AT BREAKFAST
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Below them is a corral where hands take Arabians, one by one, and work them out, letting them run and literally kick up their heels.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An impeccable Mexican butler serves them their main course, broiled fish.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes.
{DIALOGUE}: I like that.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (dubious)
{DIALOGUE}: Thanks.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable.
{DIALOGUE}: And it's good advertising.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: It doesn't hurt.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Probably.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: She happens to think the last one was murdered.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cross is visibly surprised.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: How did she get that idea?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: I think I gave it to her.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cross nods.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: Uh-huh.
{DIALOGUE}: Oh I hope you don't mind.
{DIALOGUE}: I believe they should be served with the head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes glances down at the fish whose isinglass eye is glazed over with the heat of cooking.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{META_DATA}: (laughs)
{DIALOGUE}: Tell me.
{DIALOGUE}: What do the police say?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: They're calling it an accident.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: Who's the investigating officer?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Lou Escobar – he's a Lieutenant.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know him?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Oh yes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: Where from?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: We worked in Chinatown together.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: Would you call him a capable man?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Very.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: Honest?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Far as it goes.
{DIALOGUE}: Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: None.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: That's too bad.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Too bad?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes.
{DIALOGUE}: It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride.
{DIALOGUE}: Financially speaking, of course.
{DIALOGUE}: How much are you charging her?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (carefully)
{DIALOGUE}: My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: Are you sleeping with her?
{DIALOGUE}: Come, come, Mr. Gittes.
{DIALOGUE}: You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes laughs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job.
{DIALOGUE}: Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: Mr. Gittes!
{DIALOGUE}: You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband.
{DIALOGUE}: I don't want her taken advantage of.
{DIALOGUE}: Sit down.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: What for?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This stops Gittes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He seems faintly mused by it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: Why is that funny?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: Was he right?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes shrugs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: ...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{META_DATA}: (grunts, then)
{DIALOGUE}: 'Course I'm respectable.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm old.
{DIALOGUE}: Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: His girlfriend?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, his girlfriend.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{DIALOGUE}: She's disappeared, hasn't she?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: Doesn't that strike you as odd?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: She's probably scared to death.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: When was the last time?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cross starts to reply, then there's the SOUND of a MARIACHI BAND and some men in formation clear a bluff about a hundred yards off.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are dressed like Spanish dons on horseback.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For the most part they are fat in the saddle and pass along in disordered review to the music.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection.
{DIALOGUE}: I let 'em practice up out here.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cross shakes his head.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: At my age, you tend to lose track...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Well, It was about five days ago.
{DIALOGUE}: You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle and you had one hell of an argument.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cross looks to Gittes in some real surprise.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: I've got the photographs in my office.
{DIALOGUE}: If they'll help you remember.
{DIALOGUE}: What was the argument about?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{META_DATA}: (a long pause, then:)
{DIALOGUE}: My daughter.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: What about her?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes.
{DIALOGUE}: I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her.
{DIALOGUE}: I'd like to help her if I can.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't realize you and Hollis were so fond of each other.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cross looks hatefully at Gittes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{META_DATA}: (painfully)
{DIALOGUE}: Well... she's an extremely jealous person.
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: How did you find out?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Okay.
{DIALOGUE}: My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement.
{DIALOGUE}: Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: Just find the girl.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CROSS
{DIALOGUE}: Avocado groves?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. HALL OF RECORDS – DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dark and quiet except for the whirring of fans.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes approaches one of the CLERKS at a desk.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: I'm a little lost.
{DIALOGUE}: Where can I find the plat books for the northwest valley?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Clerk's droopy eyes widen a little.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLERK
{DIALOGUE}: Part of it's in Ventura County.
{DIALOGUE}: We don't have Ventura County in our Hall of Records.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Which is a snotty remark.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes smiles.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: I'll settle for L.A. County.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLERK
{META_DATA}: (regards him, then)
{DIALOGUE}: Row twenty-three, section C.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Clerk turns away abruptly.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THROUGH THE STACKS
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes sees the Clerk turn to another, say something.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The second clerk gets on the phone.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes watches a moment, then swiftly turns his attention to the stacks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He hauls down the northwest valley volume, opens it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's huge and there's a lot to go through.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The print itself makes him squint.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INSERT PAGE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Showing TRACT, LOT, PARCEL, even a METES AND BOUNDS designation where the description of the land parcel is long and hopelessly involved e.g. '6000 paces to Rio Seco, thence 7000 paces to Loma Linda, etc.' These descriptions are old and faded.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In the owners' column, however there are numerous freshly typed names pasted over the prior owners.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Hauls the huge volume back to the Clerk's desk.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (to Clerk)
{DIALOGUE}: Say... uh... sonny.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Clerk turns sharply around.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLERK
{DIALOGUE}: Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes looks a little surprised.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Then these are all new owners?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLERK
{DIALOGUE}: That's right.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (astonished)
{DIALOGUE}: But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLERK
{DIALOGUE}: If that's what it says.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Can I check one of these volumes out?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLERK
{META_DATA}: (quietly snotty)
{DIALOGUE}: Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Well, then, how about a ruler?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLERK
{DIALOGUE}: A ruler?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: The print's pretty fine.
{DIALOGUE}: I forgot my glasses.
{DIALOGUE}: I'd like to be able to read across.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The exasperated Clerk reaches around, rummages, slaps a ruler on the desk.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes goes back to the stacks with the ruler.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He opens the book, places the ruler not horizontally but vertically.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INSERT PLAT BOOK NORTHWEST VALLEY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beside the OWNER column he places the ruler, looks toward the clerks, then swiftly rips down the page, tearing out a strip about two inches wide containing the owner's name and property description.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he tears, he either sniffles or coughs to cover the SOUND of the PAPER being ripped.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. ROAD – GITTES DRIVING – DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Amidst a hall of shimmering dust and heat, parched and drying groves, narrower roads.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He passes a ramshackle home, next to a rotting orchard.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is a "SOLD" sign on the collapsing barn.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes stops, checks it against the names he had taken from the Hall of Records.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: OLD STUCCO BUILDINGS FURTHER ON
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And a few withered pepper trees.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes has paused at this dried-up intersection.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is a "SOLD" sign on a drug store.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes looks OFF SCREEN.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coming INTO VIEW above the arid fields is a spiraling cloud of purple smoke.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes heads in that direction.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes parks at the edge of the field.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: About twenty yards away is a man mounted on a strange machine, holding a lid off it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Billowing lavender clouds are belching forth.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Several CHILDREN are watching the man at work.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (to one of the Children)
{DIALOGUE}: Say, pal, what's he doing?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILD
{DIALOGUE}: Making some rain.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes nods, walks over to the man who is elaborately busying himself with the intricacies of his machine.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's aware of Gittes watching him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Well, you're just the man I'm looking for.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Rainmaker now glances down at Gittes, who as usual is immaculately dressed.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Some associates and I are thinking of buying property out here.
{DIALOGUE}: Of course, we're worried about the rainfall.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Rainmaker steps down.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RAINMAKER
{DIALOGUE}: No problem with me on the Job.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: (glancing around at the desolate, dry field) Do you have any references?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: RAINMAKER & GITTES
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RAINMAKER
{DIALOGUE}: City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (nods)
{DIALOGUE}: That's swell.
{DIALOGUE}: But how about here?
{META_DATA}: (pulling out names from his pocket)
{DIALOGUE}: Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RAINMAKER
{DIALOGUE}: Never heard of 'em... new owners?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RAINMAKER
{META_DATA}: (climbing back up)
{DIALOGUE}: Lot of turnover these days.
{DIALOGUE}: Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, I'll do that.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: GITTES DRIVING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Is now covered with a film of dust:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He reaches a fork in the dirt road.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There are a couple of mailboxes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes takes this fork and begins a slow ascent.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he does, the tops of a line of bright green trees can be SEEN, coming more and more INTO VIEW, row upon row of avocado and walnut groves, their foliage heavy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The few structures in the distance are white-washed, and well kept, right down to the white-washed stones that mark the pathway to the home.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Towering above it all is a huge wooden water tank.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes drives through a gate that has "NO TRESPASSING" and "KEEP OUT PRIVATE PROPERTY" signs neatly printed on it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He drives down the road into the grove.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: GITTES
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Pulls to a halt in the road flanking the orchard lanes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He puts the car in neutral, stares at the trees.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: By contrast with what he has seen they are lush and beautiful, their heavy branches barely swaying in a light breeze.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then a SHOTGUN BLAST abruptly strips bare the branches of the tree he'd been staring at.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. AVOCADO GROVES – DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes is shocked.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks behind him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riding on horseback down the field in the direction he had just driven is a Red- Faced Man in overalls.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His hat blows off his head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He does not, however, lose the shotgun he has just used.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes' lane of retreat is denied him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He guns the car, and takes off down one of the orchard lanes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MOVING WITH GITTES
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The dirt lane is rough.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Gittes nears the end of it, a Younger Man on a mule blocks the exit.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes veers a sharp left, knocking a branch off one of the trees, heading down one of the cross-lanes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Here he's pursued by a scraggly dog that nips at the tires.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes yells at it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ANGLE ON GROVE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Two farmers on foot, one using a crutch, run down the lanes toward a dust trail rising above the trees.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They've spotted it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clearly it's from Gittes' car.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This hide-and-seek chase between one man on horseback, one on a mule and a couple on foot continues up and down and across the orchard lanes until Gittes' front tire and radiator are ruptured by another SHOTGUN BLAST.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes' car veers off, scattering a stray gaggle of geese and smacks into an avocado tree, shaking loose a barrage of the heavy fruit onto Gittes and the car.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes immediately tries to get out through the branches over the back of his car, but he's pulled off it by one of the younger farmers, a huge brute who he begins to tussle with.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Crippled Farmer begins to bang Gittes on the back with his crutch.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The two of them manage to pound Gittes to the ground within moments, where the Crippled Farmer continues to whack away at Gittes with the crutch.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The older Red Faced Farmer with the shotgun and the Man on a mule ride up.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RED FACED FARMER
{DIALOGUE}: All right, quit it!
{DIALOGUE}: Quit now!
{DIALOGUE}: Search the man, see if he's armed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes is hefted half off the ground and the two younger Farmers spin him around, going through his clothes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes is badly banged up and half out on his feet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They toss his wallet, his silver cigarette case, etc. on the ground.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RED FACED FARMER
{DIALOGUE}: I said see if he's armed, not empty his pockets.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BIG FARMER
{DIALOGUE}: He ain't armed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes leans against the back of his car, breathing heavily.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RED FACED FARMER
{DIALOGUE}: All right, mister.
{DIALOGUE}: Who you with?
{DIALOGUE}: Water department or the real estate office?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes' back is to the Red Faced Farmer.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He has trouble catching his breath.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Crippled Farmer pokes him rudely in the back with his crutch.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes turns sharply.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (to Crippled Farmer)
{DIALOGUE}: Get away from me!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRIPPLED FARMER
{DIALOGUE}: Answer him!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES

{CHARACTER_NAME}: BIG FARMER
{META_DATA}: (shoving Gittes)
{DIALOGUE}: Whyn't you pick on somebody your own size?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RED FACED FARMER

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gittes looks up at the Red Faced Farmer.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{META_DATA}: (reaching down for his wallet)
{DIALOGUE}: Name's Gittes.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm a private investigator and I'm not with either one.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RED FACED FARMER

{CHARACTER_NAME}: GITTES
{DIALOGUE}: Client hired me to see... whether or not the water department's been irrigating your land.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RED FACED FARMER
{DIALOGUE}: Irrigating my land?
{META_DATA}: (exploding)
{DIALOGUE}: The water department's been sending you people to blow up my water tanks!
{DIALOGUE}: They threw poison down three of my wells!
{DIALOGUE}: I call that a funny way to irrigate.
{DIALOGUE}: Who'd hire you for a thing like that?
