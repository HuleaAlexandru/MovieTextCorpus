{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{META_DATA}: (leaning in to kiss Christine)
{DIALOGUE}: Seriously though, the freeway was unbelievable today.

{META_DATA}: (to Jack)
{DIALOGUE}: Your friend is modest.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, Miles, don't be so modest.
{DIALOGUE}: Indulge them.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't make me out to be a liar.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. ERGANIAN
{DIALOGUE}: What subject is your book?
{DIALOGUE}: Non- fiction?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: No, it's a novel.
{DIALOGUE}: Fiction.
{DIALOGUE}: Although there's a lot from my own life, so I guess technically some of it is non- fiction.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. ERGANIAN
{DIALOGUE}: Good, I like non-fiction.
{DIALOGUE}: There is so much to know about the world that I think reading a story someone just invented is kind of a waste of time.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRISTINE
{DIALOGUE}: So which one do you like better?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: I like them both, but if pressed I'd have to say I prefer the dark.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Come on.
{DIALOGUE}: You're fucking hungover.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Okay, there was a tasting last night.
{DIALOGUE}: But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up.
{DIALOGUE}: Check out the box.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack turns around, and starts rooting around in a CARDBOARD WINE BOX.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Why did you tell them my book was being published?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: You said you had it all lined up.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: No, I didn't.
{DIALOGUE}: What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, Conundrum.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: ...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor.
{DIALOGUE}: She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this.
{DIALOGUE}: It's always a fucking waiting game.
{DIALOGUE}: I've been through it too many times already.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{DIALOGUE}: Senior editor?
{DIALOGUE}: Sounds like you're in to me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: It's a long shot, all right?
{DIALOGUE}: And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not getting my hopes up.
{DIALOGUE}: I've stopped caring.
{DIALOGUE}: That's it.
{DIALOGUE}: I've stopped caring.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack sits back in his seat holding up a bottle of CHAMPAGNE and TWO GLASSES.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: But I know it's going to happen this time.
{DIALOGUE}: I can feel it.
{DIALOGUE}: This is the one.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm proud of you, man.
{DIALOGUE}: You're the smartest guy I know.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack now begins to remove the foil from the champagne bottle.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Don't open that now.
{DIALOGUE}: It's warm.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Come on, we're celebrating.
{DIALOGUE}: I say we pop it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: That's a 1992 Byron.
{DIALOGUE}: It's really rare.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't open it now.
{DIALOGUE}: I've been saving it!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack untwists the wire.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Instantly the cork pops off, and a fountain of champagne erupts.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: For Christ's Sake, Jack!
{DIALOGUE}: You just wasted like half of it!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack begins pouring two glasses.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Shut up.
{META_DATA}: (handing Miles a glass)
{DIALOGUE}: Here's to a great week.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES

{DIALOGUE}: Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour.
{DIALOGUE}: I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They clink and drink.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, that's tasty.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: 100% Pinot Noir.
{DIALOGUE}: Single vineyard.
{DIALOGUE}: They don't even make it anymore.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Pinot Noir?
{DIALOGUE}: How come it's white?
{DIALOGUE}: Doesn't noir mean dark?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Jesus.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country.
{DIALOGUE}: They'll think you're a moron.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Just tell me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Color in the red wines comes from the skins.
{DIALOGUE}: This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{META_DATA}: (not really listening)
{DIALOGUE}: Sure is tasty.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: And?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: I liked it a lot.
{DIALOGUE}: A lot of improvements.
{DIALOGUE}: It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: How about the new ending?
{DIALOGUE}: Did you like that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Oh yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: Much better.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: There is no new ending.
{DIALOGUE}: Page 750 on is exactly the same.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Christine's voice is so loud that Jack has to hold the phone away from his ear.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK

{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
{DIALOGUE}: Good.
{DIALOGUE}: That's good.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A silence, then --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: So what's up?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
{DIALOGUE}: Just seeing how you're doing.
{DIALOGUE}: And, um, Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack looks at Miles in a mute appeal for sympathy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
{DIALOGUE}: So what do you think?
{DIALOGUE}: With the Feldmans?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack hasn't even really heard the question.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: The Feldmans.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the conversation continues, Miles replaces the GAS PUMP, screws the GAS CAP back on, and together the guys get back into the car.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We DRIVE AWAY WITH THEM.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
{DIALOGUE}: Really?
{DIALOGUE}: Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Well, then put him at the singles table.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
{DIALOGUE}: The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Then put him with the Feldmans.
{DIALOGUE}: Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
{DIALOGUE}: Don't dismiss me.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm trying to include you in this decision.
{DIALOGUE}: He's your friend.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't dismiss you.
{DIALOGUE}: I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide.
{DIALOGUE}: Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles.
{DIALOGUE}: I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding.
{DIALOGUE}: Isn't that the point of this?
{DIALOGUE}: Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A silence.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
{DIALOGUE}: Why are you being so defensive?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know, Christine.
{DIALOGUE}: Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
{DIALOGUE}: I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Listen.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
{DIALOGUE}: Bye.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES

{DIALOGUE}: I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: That's your problem, Miles.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Speak for yourself.
{DIALOGUE}: I get chicks looking at me all the time.
{DIALOGUE}: All ages.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: It's not worth it.

{DIALOGUE}: That's going to be my best man gift to you.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: I'd rather have a knife.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college.
{DIALOGUE}: Now it's worse -- you're wasting away.
{DIALOGUE}: Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote.
{DIALOGUE}: Your books.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: You still seeing that shrink?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES

{DIALOGUE}: Well, I say fuck that.
{DIALOGUE}: You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Jack.
{DIALOGUE}: This week is not about me.
{DIALOGUE}: It's about you.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm going to show you a good time.
{DIALOGUE}: We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: And get your bone smooched.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack spots the waitress coming out of the kitchen and motions for more coffee.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She nods and smiles, indicating she'll be right over.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack returns the smile and holds up a hand to signal he'll wait.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack turns back to see Miles watching him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: What?
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. CENTRAL COAST - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In a series of shots, the Saab -- now with its TOP DOWN -- makes its way onto the 101 and travels past landmarks that those familiar with the Santa Barbara area might recognize.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MUSIC accompanies this sequence that anchors us into the rhythm of a road trip.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY

{DIALOGUE}: I need a glass.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay.
{DIALOGUE}: One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.
{META_DATA}: (looking out the window)
{DIALOGUE}: Look how beautiful this view is.
{DIALOGUE}: What a day!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: I thought you hated Chardonnay.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: I like all varietals.
{DIALOGUE}: I just don't generally like the way they manipulate Chardonnay in California -- too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. SANTA ROSA TURN-OFF - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Saab passes over the 101 and turns onto SANTA ROSA road.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The boys now pass vineyards of immaculate grapevines.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Jesus, what a day!
{DIALOGUE}: Isn't it gorgeous?
{DIALOGUE}: And the ocean's just right over that ridge.
{DIALOGUE}: See, the reason this region's great for Pinot is that the cold air off the Pacific flows in at night through these transverse valleys and cools down the berries.
{DIALOGUE}: Pinot's a very thin-skinned grape and doesn't like heat or humidity.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack looks at Miles, admiring his friend's vast learning and articulateness.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Saab now pulls of the road and makes its way down a long gravel DRIVEWAY.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Hey, Miles.
{DIALOGUE}: I really hope your novel sells.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Thanks, Jack.
{DIALOGUE}: So do I.
{META_DATA}: (noticing)
{DIALOGUE}: Here we are.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. SANFORD TASTING ROOM - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles brings the car to a stop in the parking lot.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As they get out and walk --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: I told you.
{DIALOGUE}: Filet and salmon.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, but how are they making the salmon?
{DIALOGUE}: Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce?
{DIALOGUE}: Teriyaki?
{DIALOGUE}: Curry?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{DIALOGUE}: Salmon.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't you always have white wine with fish?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, Jesus.
{DIALOGUE}: Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{META_DATA}: (taking out his phone)
{DIALOGUE}: Let me call Christine.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Doesn't have to be now.
{DIALOGUE}: Let's go taste.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: I owe her a call anyway.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles must curb his eagerness to go inside the tasting room as Jack SPEED DIALS.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Hey, honey.
{DIALOGUE}: So we're up here about to taste some whites, and we need to know how the caterers are going to make the salmon.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack listens, then grows suddenly impatient.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: No, I know, I didn't forget, but we wound up at Miles's mom's house, and it got really late, and it was hard to call, so I'm calling you now.
{DIALOGUE}: I said I was sorry.
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, I did.
{META_DATA}: (to Miles)
{DIALOGUE}: You heard me say I was sorry, right?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles just shrugs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Miles heard me say I was sorry.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Jack gets more and more involved with the phone call, he wanders off across the parking lot, progressively out of earshot.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Give me a break, will you?
{DIALOGUE}: I just called to find out about the salmon -- for our wedding -- to be more involved, like you said -- and all you want to do is get into it about last night and, okay, I'm sorry.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm sorry I didn't call.
{DIALOGUE}: You're totally right.
{DIALOGUE}: I know, but I'm trying to make this the best wedding I can with the best wine we can find.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't I get any credit for that?
{DIALOGUE}: Okay.
{DIALOGUE}: Look, I've got to go.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm out here in the parking lot, and Miles is waiting for me...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And so it goes, Jack's voice rising and falling.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles decides to head inside.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SANFORD TASTING ROOM - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles is at the bar, TWO GLASSES in front of him.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CHRIS BURROUGHS, a POURER in a cowboy hat and ponytail, comes over.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRIS
{DIALOGUE}: This is the condemned man?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Here he is.
{DIALOGUE}: Jack, Chris.
{DIALOGUE}: Chris, Jack.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chris and Jack shake hands.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: How you doing?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRIS
{DIALOGUE}: You guys want to start with the Vin Gris?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Sounds good.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: TWO GLASSES are filled with small amounts of PINOT NOIR VIN GRIS.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: This is rose, right?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Good, yeah, it is a rose.
{DIALOGUE}: Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Pinot noir?
{DIALOGUE}: Not again!
{META_DATA}: (joking, to Chris)
{DIALOGUE}: You know, not all Pinots are noir.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They laugh.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles swirls his glass in tight circles on the bar, then lifts it to smell.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack clumsily imitates Miles, perhaps even spilling some wine in the process.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Let me show you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see details of what Miles now describes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: First take your glass and examine the wine against the light.
{DIALOGUE}: You're looking at color and clarity.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: What color is it supposed to be?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Depends on the varietal.
{DIALOGUE}: Just get a sense of it.
{DIALOGUE}: Thick?
{DIALOGUE}: Thin?
{DIALOGUE}: Watery?
{DIALOGUE}: Syrupy?
{DIALOGUE}: Inky?
{DIALOGUE}: Amber, whatever...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Huh.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Now tip it.
{DIALOGUE}: What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim.
{DIALOGUE}: Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds.
{DIALOGUE}: This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly.
{DIALOGUE}: Now stick your nose in it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack waves the glass under his nose as if it were a perfume bottle.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Don't be shy.
{DIALOGUE}: Get your nose in there.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack now buries his nose in the glass.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: What do you smell?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{DIALOGUE}: Wine?
{DIALOGUE}: Fermented grapes?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles smells.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: There's not much there yet, but you can still find...
{META_DATA}: (more sniffs)
{DIALOGUE}: ...a little citrus... maybe some strawberry... passion fruit... and there's even a hint of like asparagus... or like a nutty Edam cheese.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack smells again and begins to brighten.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Huh.
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe a little strawberry.
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, strawberry.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not so sure about the cheese.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles expertly swirls the wine.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack follows suit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Oxygenating it opens it up, unlocks the aroma and the flavors.
{DIALOGUE}: Very important.
{DIALOGUE}: Now we smell again.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They do so.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack smiles.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: That's what you do with every one.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: When do we get to drink it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Now.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack gulps his wine down in one shot.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles chews his before swallowing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: How would you rate this one?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.
{META_DATA}: (to Chris)
{DIALOGUE}: This is the new one, right, Chris?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRIS
{DIALOGUE}: Released it about two months ago.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Nice job.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRIS
{DIALOGUE}: We like it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{META_DATA}: (to Miles)
{DIALOGUE}: You know, you could work in a wine store.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, that would be a good move.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now Miles notices something about Jack.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Are you chewing gum?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Want some?
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. SOLVANG, CALIFORNIA - DAY

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pounds on the wall.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Hey Jack, hurry up!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: Just a minute!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Opening the bedside drawer, Miles finds a GIDEON'S BIBLE and tosses it in the trash -- apparently his hotel routine.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. HIGHWAY 246 - DUSK
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Freshly showered and dressed for dinner, Miles and Jack amble along the shoulder of this busy local two-lane highway.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They pass a mall and a car dealership.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: I thought you said it was close.
{DIALOGUE}: Now I'm all pitted out.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: It's not even a mile.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: We should have driven.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Not with the wine list these people have.
{DIALOGUE}: We don't want to hold back.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Whoa.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing?
{DIALOGUE}: Tell the truth.
{DIALOGUE}: You've been through it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason.
{DIALOGUE}: So I think it's great.
{DIALOGUE}: It's time.
{DIALOGUE}: You've got to have your eyes open, that's all.
{DIALOGUE}: I mean, look at me.
{DIALOGUE}: I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business.
{DIALOGUE}: Showing me the ropes.
{DIALOGUE}: And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian.
{DIALOGUE}: So I'm thinking about it.
{DIALOGUE}: But I don't know, might get a little incestuous.
{DIALOGUE}: But Mike does pretty well.
{DIALOGUE}: A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: So you're going to stop acting?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: No way.
{DIALOGUE}: This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying.
{DIALOGUE}: I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Uh-huh.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: We're not getting any younger, right?
{DIALOGUE}: And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating.
{DIALOGUE}: Even with my new manager.
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe it's time to settle down.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: If that's what feels right.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{META_DATA}: (convincing himself)
{DIALOGUE}: It does.
{DIALOGUE}: Feels right.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack is beginning to get the hang of things.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GARY
{DIALOGUE}: What do you think?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration.
{DIALOGUE}: Nice fruit.

{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: Tight.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{META_DATA}: (to Gary)

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing?
{DIALOGUE}: Obviously that's over.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: You don't know anything about this woman.
{DIALOGUE}: Calm down.
{DIALOGUE}: Let's just eat, okay?
{META_DATA}: (focusing on the menu)

{DIALOGUE}: Perfect.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton.
{DIALOGUE}: How would that ever work?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Why do you always focus on the negative?
{DIALOGUE}: Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: She works for tips!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: You're blind, dude.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles quickly POPS A XANAX.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack gives him a final look in the eye.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: We're going in.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. LOS OLIVOS CAFE - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The boys enter this cozy if crowded restaurant and exchange words with the HOSTESS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then they notice --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MAYA AND STEPHANIE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: at a booth waving at them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They look great.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MILES AND JACK
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: make their way to the table, Jack wearing a broad, confident SMILE.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: AT THE TABLE --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack plops down next to Stephanie, while Miles politely eases in on Maya's side.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack touches a hand to Stephanie's bare neck and massages it meaningfully.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHANIE
{DIALOGUE}: Good.
{DIALOGUE}: How're you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Great.
{DIALOGUE}: You look great.
{META_DATA}: (including Maya)
{DIALOGUE}: You both do.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHANIE
{DIALOGUE}: Not so bad yourself.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Meanwhile Miles looks over at Maya and purses his lips in an affable if uncomfortable smile.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: What are you drinking?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Oh yeah?
{DIALOGUE}: How is it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{META_DATA}: (sliding the glass)
{DIALOGUE}: Try it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Miles swirls the wine and takes a sip, he begins to relax.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Nice.
{DIALOGUE}: Very nice.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Twelve months in oak.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: On a Sauvignon Blanc?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: I know the winemaker.
{DIALOGUE}: She comes in the restaurant all the time.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: This is good.
{DIALOGUE}: Little hints of clove.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: I know.
{DIALOGUE}: I love that.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: LATER --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A WAITER finishes listing off the specials.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WAITER
{DIALOGUE}: ...medallions of pork with a dusting of black truffles served with a root vegetable foulon and wasabi-whipped potatoes.
{DIALOGUE}: And finally a Copper River salmon grilled on an alder wood plank.
{DIALOGUE}: And that comes with roasted new potatoes and steamed watercress.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The four diners exchange looks of delight.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WAITER
{DIALOGUE}: And who gets the wine list?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles raises his hand and takes the leather-bound book.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{META_DATA}: (teasing)
{DIALOGUE}: I guess Miles wants it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack glares at Miles, who immediately gets the hint.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Nope.
{DIALOGUE}: You ladies choose.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack smiles and nods his approval.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack takes the book out of Miles's hands and offers it to the girls.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: You choose, Stephanie.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHANIE
{META_DATA}: (opening it)
{DIALOGUE}: So what does everyone feel like?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Whatever you girls want.
{DIALOGUE}: It's on us tonight.
{DIALOGUE}: Sky's the limit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: No, we're paying for the wine.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: I don't think so.
{DIALOGUE}: We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Well, in that case...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles draws a long breath.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHANIE
{DIALOGUE}: What's everyone ordering?
{DIALOGUE}: Then we can sort out the wine.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Exactement!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack shoots Miles a look.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: I'm having the salmon.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: That's what I'm having.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHANIE
{META_DATA}: (still scanning the wines)
{DIALOGUE}: I'm thinking about the duck breast.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{META_DATA}: (slapping his menu shut)
{DIALOGUE}: Me too.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Well, that narrows things down.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Stephanie lowers the menu so that only her eyes peer over the top.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She looks at the others, and they look back at her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHANIE
{DIALOGUE}: Sounds like... Pinot Noir to me.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack looks at Miles and raises one hand for a HIGH-FIVE.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Pinot!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles reluctantly slaps Jack's hand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This causes the girls to laugh.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MUSIC STARTS -- they're OFF!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: DINNER is improvised, but includes:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -- The arrival of the FIRST WINE.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -- The SALADS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -- Maya takes a turn with the wine list.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles pushes her finger down into the prices with THREE DIGITS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -- New stemware is provided with the arrival of the SECOND WINE.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -- The four of them DRINK.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Particularly Miles.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -- Stephanie and Jack get cozier and cozier.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -- The SALMON and DUCK arrive.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -- Miles is too shy to look into Maya's eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She's interested and available -- it's too much for him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -- As Miles gets DRUNKER, the camera angles become sloppier, the cutting choppier.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -- Miles PONTIFICATES about some aspect of wine that Maya and Stephanie find interesting.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Left out in the cold, his jaw tight, Jack wants to find a way in but can't.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -- Miles reaches over to refill his glass, but Jack's arm shoots out to stop him -- "Slow down."
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLOSE ON MILES as a distant RUMBLE begins to sound, the rumble of an oncoming ANXIETY ATTACK.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: By now he has drunk so much that he spaces out, descending into --
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. UNDERWORLD - DARK AND TIMELESS
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles is boarding an OPEN BOAT atop this underground river, the River Styx.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just beyond a ghoulish HUMAN CARGO the hooded boatman CHARON wields a long staff.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles is crossing over to the dark side.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. LOS OLIVOS CAFE - BACK AGAIN
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles returns to earth to find Jack and Stephanie now in their own little world -- Jack explaining something to Stephanie that she finds fascinating, just FASCINATING.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -- Miles converses with Maya, but it's clear from her bemused expression that he's being charming if not entirely coherent.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -- ANOTHER WINE reaches the table -- a Comte Armand Pornrnard.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -- Miles looks over at Jack and Stephanie.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They share a short but sensual kiss.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MOMENTS LATER --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles is on his feet threading his way through the tables.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is very unsteady, and we cut between first and third person perspectives.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: AT THE BATHROOMS --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He tries the MEN'S ROOM door but it's locked.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pulls the XANAX out his pocket and pops one in his mouth, swallowing it dry.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He notices a PAYPHONE nearby.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Thinking better of it for a moment, Miles makes a drunken bee-line for the receiver.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLOSE ON THE KEYPAD --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as many numbers are dialed, and we HEAR the TONES, completely out of sync, along with a sound melange of interior phone RINGING and a PICKUP.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE RECEIVER --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Miles presses it desperately to his head.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
{DIALOGUE}: Hello?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Victoria.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
{DIALOGUE}: Miles?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles feigns an implausible upbeat tone.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Victoria!
{DIALOGUE}: How the hell are you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
{DIALOGUE}: Fine.
{DIALOGUE}: What's, uh, what's on your mind?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Heard you got remarried!
{DIALOGUE}: Congratulations.
{DIALOGUE}: Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, Miles.
{DIALOGUE}: You're drunk.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Just some local Pinot, you know, then a little Burgundy.
{DIALOGUE}: That old Cotes de Beaune!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles laughs at his own non-existent joke.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
{DIALOGUE}: Where are you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: A little place in Los Olivos.
{DIALOGUE}: New owners.
{DIALOGUE}: Cozy ambiance.
{DIALOGUE}: Excellent food too -- you should try it.
{DIALOGUE}: Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Silence.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES (CONT' D)
{DIALOGUE}: Hello?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
{DIALOGUE}: Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more.
{DIALOGUE}: You won't see me there.
{DIALOGUE}: My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name.
{DIALOGUE}: What is his name?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
{META_DATA}: (silence, then --)
{DIALOGUE}: Ken.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Ken.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
{DIALOGUE}: Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Well, I'm not coming, Barbie.
{DIALOGUE}: So you guys have fun.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
{DIALOGUE}: I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{META_DATA}: (rushing to keep her on)
{DIALOGUE}: You see, Vicki, I just heard about this today, you getting married that is, and I was kind of taken aback.
{DIALOGUE}: Kind of hard to believe.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Silence.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
{DIALOGUE}: Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles sucks something from between his two front teeth.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Whatever you say, Vicki.
{DIALOGUE}: You're the boss.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He HANGS UP as nonchalantly as if it had been a sales call and heads back to the table.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. DEEP CANYON - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For a flash, Miles is walking an unstable, narrow ROPE BRIDGE extending vertiginously across a great CHASM.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. LOS OLIVOS CAFE - BACK AGAIN
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles reaches the table, tries to sit and SLIPS ONTO THE FLOOR.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Although at first Jack blinks heavily in disgust, the girls burst into hysterical LAUGHTER.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack then laughs too, perhaps OVER-LAUGHING.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Easy, boy.
{DIALOGUE}: Easy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Maya helps him back into the booth.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Are you all right?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Fine.
{DIALOGUE}: Just slipped.
{META_DATA}: (picking up his glass)
{DIALOGUE}: This is my blood.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles drinks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Stephanie makes a head gesture to Maya, who nods in return.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHANIE
{META_DATA}: (to the guys)
{DIALOGUE}: Excuse us.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Sorry to make you get up again, Miles.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: That's okay.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles and Jack allow the girls to pass.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: What the fuck, man?
{DIALOGUE}: What is up?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles reaches for his wine glass, but Jack moves it away.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Pull yourself together, man.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: I'm fine!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But in throwing open his arms for emphasis, he spills a WATER GLASS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack rights it and throws a napkin on the tablecloth.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Where were you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Bathroom.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Did you drink and dial?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles's silence confirms his guilt and shame.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Why do you always do this?
{DIALOGUE}: Victoria's gone, man.
{DIALOGUE}: Gone.
{DIALOGUE}: Poof.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles looks down and squeezes his eyes tight while pushing out an exhale through his nose.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Stop it.
{DIALOGUE}: You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles.
{DIALOGUE}: Fucking Maya, man.
{DIALOGUE}: She's great.
{DIALOGUE}: She's cool.
{DIALOGUE}: She's funny.
{DIALOGUE}: She knows wine.
{DIALOGUE}: What is this morose come-down bullshit?
{DIALOGUE}: These girls want to party.
{DIALOGUE}: And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays?
{DIALOGUE}: I mean, come on!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Oh Jesus, Miles.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles belligerently reaches for his Comte Armand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack lets it pass.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria.
{DIALOGUE}: How small she make you feel.
{DIALOGUE}: That's why you had the affair in the first place.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Shut up.
{DIALOGUE}: Shut your face.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Don't you see how Maya's looking at you?
{DIALOGUE}: You got her on the hook.
{DIALOGUE}: Reel her in!
{DIALOGUE}: Come on, let's rachet this up a notch.
{DIALOGUE}: You know how to to do it.
{DIALOGUE}: Here.
{META_DATA}: (passing a glass)
{DIALOGUE}: Drink some agua.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles looks at the water, takes it and drains it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The girls now return to the table.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The guys slide over.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{META_DATA}: (trying to appear sober)
{DIALOGUE}: Should we get dessert?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHANIE
{DIALOGUE}: We were thinking.
{DIALOGUE}: Why don't we go back to my place?
{DIALOGUE}: I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack raises both arms like a football referee.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Excellent idea.
{DIALOGUE}: Waiter!
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SAAB - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Trees and bushes lit by the headlights show us we're headed into the woods.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INSIDE --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack drives.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles blinks heavily as he tries to make a sense of A HAND-DRAWN MAP.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{META_DATA}: (grabbing the map)
{DIALOGUE}: Let me see that.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Saab pulls into a gravel DRIVEWAY and comes to a stop outside this wood-framed cottage.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack and Miles get out and head for the front door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On the way, Jack reaches into his coat pocket and produces a string of FOUR CONDOMS.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{META_DATA}: (tearing)
{DIALOGUE}: Here.
{DIALOGUE}: One for you, three for me.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles wordlessly takes his.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just before they climb the porch steps --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: You sure you want to do this?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack stops and looks at him for a moment with almost hostile incredulity.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE FRONT DOOR is open.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack knocks twice on the SCREEN DOOR before going in.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. STEPHANIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The boys enter this modest living room furnished with weathered but charming old furniture.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Scattered here and there are CHILDREN'S TOYS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: FINGER-PAINTINGS are taped to the walls.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CANDLES are lit, and MUSIC is playing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: We're here!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Stephanie sails in.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHANIE
{DIALOGUE}: What happened to you guys?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Couple of wrong turns.
{META_DATA}: (pointing a thumb at Miles)
{DIALOGUE}: Thanks to Magellan, here.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After a brief hug, Stephanie and Jack peck-kiss.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Hi.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHANIE
{DIALOGUE}: Hi.
{META_DATA}: (to Miles)
{DIALOGUE}: Maya's in the kitchen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles hesitates a moment before Jack elbows him toward --
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles wanders in to find Maya squatting in front of a little temperature-controlled WINE STORAGE UNIT.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Hi.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Hey.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: She got anything good?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.
{META_DATA}: (calling out)
{DIALOGUE}: Hey, Steph?
{DIALOGUE}: You sure we can open anything?
{DIALOGUE}: Anything we want?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHANIE (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: She has a Richebourg?
{DIALOGUE}: Mon dieu.
{DIALOGUE}: I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Who do you think you're dealing with here?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Maya slips out a bottle of ESCHEVAUX.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: How about this?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles nods vigorously.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Maya looks back and forth between Miles and the wine, her eyes narrowed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then she slides it back in.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Nope.
{DIALOGUE}: I don't think we know each other well enough.
{META_DATA}: (picking out another bottle)
{DIALOGUE}: I'd say this guy's more our speed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They rise, and Miles glances at the ANDREW MURRAY SYRAH and, raising his eyebrows, agrees.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Maya begins opening it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: So what gems do you have in your collection?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Not much of a collection really.
{DIALOGUE}: I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle.
{DIALOGUE}: But I've got a couple things I'm saving.
{DIALOGUE}: I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there?
{DIALOGUE}: Go get it.
{META_DATA}: (pushing him, playfully stern)
{DIALOGUE}: Right now.
{DIALOGUE}: Hurry up...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles laughs, fights back a bit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they?
{DIALOGUE}: At least that's what I've read.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, I know.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: It might be too late already.
{DIALOGUE}: What are you waiting for?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{DIALOGUE}: Special occasion.
{DIALOGUE}: With the right person.
{DIALOGUE}: It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Understanding, Maya considers her response.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: How long have you been into wine?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: I started to get serious about seven years ago.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: What was the bottle that did it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles whistles and raises his eyebrows.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Maya pours, and they clink their glasses together before savoring the wine.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Wow.
{DIALOGUE}: We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty.
{DIALOGUE}: Really good.
{DIALOGUE}: How about you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{META_DATA}: (tastes again)
{DIALOGUE}: I think they overdid it a bit.
{DIALOGUE}: Too much alcohol.
{DIALOGUE}: Overwhelms the fruit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{META_DATA}: (tasting again, impressed)
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, I'd say you're right on the money.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then Miles absently scans the REFRIGERATOR DOOR and spots a PHOTO of Stephanie holding a LITTLE GIRL.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Is this Stephanie's kid?
{DIALOGUE}: Sure is cute.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Is she sleeping or...?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: She's with her grandmother.
{DIALOGUE}: She's with Steph's mom.
{DIALOGUE}: She spends a lot of time over there.
{DIALOGUE}: Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack's voice-over voice from the other room...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: "And now for a low, low 4.8% APR..
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...is followed by PEALS OF LAUGHTER.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: You got kids?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Who me?
{DIALOGUE}: Nah, I'd just fuck them up.
{DIALOGUE}: That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, same here.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Maya nods as she sips again, looking distant for a moment, thinking about something else.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Let's go in there.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Maya takes the bottle, and they wander into --
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. STEPHANIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack and Stephanie are gone.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: From a distant bedroom comes more laughter.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Looks like our friends are hitting it off.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: While Maya goes to turn down the STEREO, Miles sits on the couch.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Maya's shirt rides up as she crouches, giving Miles a glimpse of the small of HER BACK.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She takes a seat opposite Miles on the couch.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They look at each other without speaking.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just what is the vibe here?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house.
{DIALOGUE}: All those times you came into the restaurant.
{DIALOGUE}: It's like you're a real person now.
{DIALOGUE}: Almost.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, I know.
{DIALOGUE}: It's kind of weird.
{DIALOGUE}: Out of context.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, weird.
{DIALOGUE}: But great.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: Definitely.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An awkward silence, broken by Maya.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: So what's your novel about?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Well, it's a little difficult to summarize.
{DIALOGUE}: It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke.
{DIALOGUE}: Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: What's the title?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: "The Day After Yesterday."
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Oh.
{DIALOGUE}: You mean... today?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Um... yeah but it's more...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Mrnmm, yeah... but not really.
{DIALOGUE}: It shifts around a lot.
{DIALOGUE}: Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father.
{DIALOGUE}: And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Wow.
{DIALOGUE}: Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published.
{DIALOGUE}: Really.
{DIALOGUE}: I know how hard it is.
{DIALOGUE}: Just to write it even.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{META_DATA}: (squeezing it out)
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: Thanks.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it.
{DIALOGUE}: Just like in high school.
{DIALOGUE}: It never changes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: A paper?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm working on a masters in horticulture.
{DIALOGUE}: Chipping away at it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Horticulture?
{DIALOGUE}: Wow.
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't know there was a college here.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Well...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car.
{DIALOGUE}: It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Oh yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: Who cares?
{DIALOGUE}: I'm the queen of typos.
{META_DATA}: (sipping the wine)
{DIALOGUE}: Wow, this is really starting to open up.
{DIALOGUE}: What do you think?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Can I ask you a personal question?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{META_DATA}: (bracing himself)
{DIALOGUE}: Sure.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Why are you so into Pinot?
{DIALOGUE}: It's like a thing with you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles laughs at first, then smiles wistfully at the question.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He searches for the answer in his glass and begins slowly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{DIALOGUE}: It's a hard grape to grow.
{DIALOGUE}: As you know.
{DIALOGUE}: It's thin-skinned, temperamental, ripens early.
{DIALOGUE}: It's not a survivor like Cabernet that can grow anywhere and thrive even when neglected.
{DIALOGUE}: Pinot needs constant care and attention and in fact can only grow in specific little tucked- away corners of the world.
{DIALOGUE}: And only the most patient and nurturing growers can do it really, can tap into Pinot's most fragile, delicate qualities.
{DIALOGUE}: Only when someone has taken the time to truly understand its potential can Pinot be coaxed into its fullest expression.
{DIALOGUE}: And when that happens, its flavors are the most haunting and brilliant and subtle and thrilling and ancient on the planet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Maya has found this answer revealing and moving.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason.
{DIALOGUE}: By comparison.
{DIALOGUE}: How about you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: What about me?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{DIALOGUE}: Why are you into wine?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband.
{DIALOGUE}: He had a big, kind of show-off cellar.
{DIALOGUE}: But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah?
{DIALOGUE}: Like what?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Like what a fraud he was.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles laughs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: No, but I do like to think about the life of wine, how it's a living thing.
{DIALOGUE}: I like to think about what was going on the year the grapes were growing, how the sun was shining that summer or if it rained... what the weather was like.
{DIALOGUE}: I think about all those people who tended and picked the grapes, and if it's an old wine, how many of them must be dead by now.
{DIALOGUE}: I love how wine continues to evolve, how every time I open a bottle it's going to taste different than if I had opened it on any other day.
{DIALOGUE}: Because a bottle of wine is actually alive -- it's constantly evolving and gaining complexity.
{DIALOGUE}: That is, until it peaks -- like your '61 -- and begins its steady, inevitable decline.
{DIALOGUE}: And it tastes so fucking good.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now it is Miles's turn to be swept away.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Maya's face tells us the moment is right, but Miles remains frozen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He needs another sign, and Maya is bold enough to offer it: reaches out and places one hand atop his.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{META_DATA}: (pointing)
{DIALOGUE}: Bathroom over there?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles gets up and walks out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Maya sighs and gets and American Spirit out of her purse.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. STEPHANIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The bathroom's a MESS -- the shower curtain is filthy, and the chipped and water-stained tub is filled with CHILDREN'S BATH TOYS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles is bent over the sink splashing water on his face, trying to sober up and gather his courage.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stands, and without drying his face, presses his palms against his cheeks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he takes a deep breath and drops his hands.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: You are such a loser.
{DIALOGUE}: Come on!
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles comes out of the bathroom and looks for Maya, but she's not there.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he hears a noise from the kitchen, so he goes through the door into --
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Maya is at the sink, filling a glass with water.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: I was just getting some water.
{DIALOGUE}: You want some water?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles goes to stand by her and accepts a glass of water.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just as she's about to fill a second glass, he stops her and looks her in the eye, trying to recapture a moment that is long gone.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He kisses her and she kisses back, but the whole thing feels strained and awkward.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After a few seconds, Maya breaks away.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Nice.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But instead of resuming the kiss, she steps past him, heading back into the living room.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: I should probably get going.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles realizes he's blown it and silently berates himself.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SAAB - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles drives down the hill behind Maya's car, which leads him through this very rural road.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. WHERE THE ROAD MEETS THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Maya's car comes to a stop just ahead of the Saab.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She puts it in PARK and gets out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: AT THE SAAB --

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Got it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: I had a good time tonight, Miles.
{DIALOGUE}: I really did.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Good.
{DIALOGUE}: So did I.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Okay.
{DIALOGUE}: See you around.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Um... did you still want to read my novel?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: Sure.
{DIALOGUE}: Of course.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles turns to the backseat, locates a large MANUSCRIPT BOX, and hands it to Maya.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Wow.
{DIALOGUE}: Great.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns around again, produces a SECOND BOX, and hands it over as well.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Hope you like it.
{DIALOGUE}: Feel free to stop reading at any time.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll take no offense.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAYA
{DIALOGUE}: Goodnight, Miles.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She gives him a friendly peck on the cheek.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After she gets back in her car, she heads in one direction while Miles heads in the opposite.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: OMIT.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: UNDER BLACK --
{META_DATA}: TUESDAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack's cellphone RINGS.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: NOW EARLY MORNING --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Still fully clothed, Miles staggers across the room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Fishing the phone out of Jack's windbreaker pocket, he looks at the CALLER ID: "Erganian, Christine" and the number.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He briefly considers his options -- answer it?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: shut it off?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -- before placing it atop Jack's suitcase.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The moment he lies back down on the bed, the MOTEL PHONE RINGS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An old DIGITAL CLOCK next to it reads 7:l0.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Miles closes his eyes and pulls the pillow over his aching head, we again --
{META_DATA}: FADE TO BLACK.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: LATER --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: VROOM!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Outside a roaring MOTORCYCLE comes to a stop.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then over the sound of an IDLING ENGINE come familiar if indistinct VOICES and LAUGHTER.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles opens his bleary eyes and listens.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: FOOTSTEPS pound on the balcony outside, and Jack lets himself in, flushed and exuberant.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Fucking chick is unbelievable.
{DIALOGUE}: Un-be- lieve-able!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pounds on the wall, then goes into the bathroom and without closing the door unzips his pants to PEE.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty.
{DIALOGUE}: Nasty nasty nasty.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system.
{DIALOGUE}: Congratulations.
{DIALOGUE}: Mission accomplished.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A hungover Miles gets up and looks out the door Jack has left open.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Down in the parking lot he sees --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: STEPHANIE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: atop a mid-sized MOTORCYCLE, wearing a weathered fringed suede jacket.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She gives him a big friendly wave.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MILES
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: returns the wave and goes back inside.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: You didn't invite Stephanie to come with us, did you?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With a FLUSH Jack emerges from the bathroom and opens his bag.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, hey, change of plans.
{DIALOGUE}: Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: We were supposed to play golf.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: You go.
{DIALOGUE}: In fact, use my clubs.
{DIALOGUE}: They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.
{META_DATA}: (slapping some cash on the dresser)
{DIALOGUE}: It's on me.
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{META_DATA}: (sitting down)
{DIALOGUE}: Count me out.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Oooh, I see.
{DIALOGUE}: Didn't go so good last night, huh?
{DIALOGUE}: That's a shocker.
{DIALOGUE}: You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood?
{DIALOGUE}: You dumb fuck.
{DIALOGUE}: Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles looks down.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack heads for the door.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Later.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack stops, eyeing Miles suspiciously.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles tosses Jack his phone.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack flips it open and scrolls down with his thumb.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He doesn't like what he sees.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, boy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{META_DATA}: (pointing at the room phone)
{DIALOGUE}: She's been leaving messages here too.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: Okay.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He SNAPS the phone shut and puts it back.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: You should call her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: I will.
{META_DATA}: (heading out the door)
{DIALOGUE}: See ya!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Right now.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Okay!
{DIALOGUE}: Jesus!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack picks up his phone, sits on the bed and looks defiantly at Miles.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: I've got no problem calling her.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now Jack closes his eyes and brings the heel of his hand to his forehead as he begins to concoct the BIG LIE.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{META_DATA}: (opening his phone)
{DIALOGUE}: Wait outside, will you?
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles wanders out and looks down at Stephanie.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHANIE
{DIALOGUE}: That was fun last night.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: Good food.
{DIALOGUE}: You've got quite a wine collection.
{DIALOGUE}: Very impressive.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHANIE
{DIALOGUE}: Thanks.
{DIALOGUE}: Hey, I talked to Maya this morning.
{DIALOGUE}: She said she had a good time too.
{DIALOGUE}: You should call her.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles says nothing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHANIE
{DIALOGUE}: Where's Jack?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: He had to make a phone call.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Stephanie cuts her bike's engine and climbs off, propping it up on the kickstand.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHANIE
{DIALOGUE}: So what are you up to today, Miles?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Just kickin' back, I guess.
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{DIALOGUE}: Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHANIE
{DIALOGUE}: Huh.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHANIE
{DIALOGUE}: Oops.
{DIALOGUE}: Sorry.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: You golf?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHANIE
{DIALOGUE}: Me?
{DIALOGUE}: No, I think it's kind of a stupid game.
{DIALOGUE}: I mean, at least, I could never get into it.
{DIALOGUE}: I tried it once.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Huh.
{DIALOGUE}: Jack loves golf.
{DIALOGUE}: Crazy about it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just then Jack cracks open the motel room door.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{META_DATA}: (hushed)
{DIALOGUE}: Hey Miles.
{DIALOGUE}: Miles.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles ducks back inside.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Do you have that other condom?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles reaches into his wallet and hands over the little foil square.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: What'd Christine say?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Lucked out -- got voice mail.
{DIALOGUE}: Everything's cool.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. WINDMILL INN - CONTINUOUS
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack bounds out of the room and down the stairs like a child on Christmas morning.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles watches Jack climb on the bike behind Stephanie, grasping her waist.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Stephanie and Jack PEEL OUT, leaving Miles alone on the balcony.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLOSE ON MILES --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As we begin to hear a SNIPPING sound which carries us to --
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. MOTEL ROOM BALCONY - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles sits outside carefully trimming his toenails.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SNIP, SNIP, SNIP.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MUSIC BEGINS for this mournful montage of solitude.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. MOTEL LOBBY - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles takes a styrofoam cup and helps himself to a cup of complimentary COFFEE from a PUMP THERMOS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he takes a look at the rack of pamphlets of local TOURIST ATTRACTIONS -- a water park, a mystery cave, and of course winery after winery.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. WINDMILL INN JACUZZI - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Amid turbulent water, Miles corrects his students' papers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is alone in the tub, but at the nearby pool STOCKY KIDS play noisily with SUPER-SOAKERS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: OVER MILES'S SHOULDER --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The PAPER he's reading is marked up with circled spelling errors, and one entire paragraph has been crossed out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Finding a new error, Miles writes "NO!!!"
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CAMERA PANS to reveal a STACK of papers already heavily marked with corrections, some of them mottled with water stains.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles FLOSSES, his lips pulled back into a grotesque moue.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he brushes with a SONIC-CARE TOOTHBRUSH.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: LATER --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles checks his machine.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SAAB - CONTINUOUS
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Whistling absently as he drives, Miles leans over to turn the radio on and fiddle around to find a good station.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then all of a sudden --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WHUMP!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The car has struck something with a hideous sound followed immediately by the receding "ARF-ARF-ARF-ARF" of an injured DOG in the Saab's wake.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles applies the BRAKES.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. BUCOLIC ROAD - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles gets out of his car just in time to see --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A DOG
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: scampering into the nearby woods.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles looks around -- has anyone seen him?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Is there a nearby residence?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Finding nothing, Miles momentarily weighs his options before finally GIVING CHASE.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He follows the path of the dog into --
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. ROADSIDE WOODS - CONTINUOUS
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Still hearing occasional distant barking, Miles finds his way among the trees and bushes, looking in vain for the ill- fated cur.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After a frenetic search, Miles reluctantly gives up and heads back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: OMIT.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. BUCOLIC ROAD - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles has returned to where he hit the dog.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just then, Miles notices TWO MEXICAN CHILDREN watching him from just down the road.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They disappear into the bushes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Looking like a criminal, Miles trots back to the Saab climbs behind the wheel and speeds away.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT./INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

{DIALOGUE}: What're you drinking?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack reaches over to check out the bottle's label.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles remains cool to Jack's amiability.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Any good?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles shrugs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{META_DATA}: (to the bartender)
{DIALOGUE}: Could I get a glass please?
{META_DATA}: (to Miles)
{DIALOGUE}: Stephanie took me out into the Pinot fields today.
{DIALOGUE}: It was awesome.
{DIALOGUE}: I think I finally got a handle on the whole process, from the soil to the vine to the -- what do you call it?
{DIALOGUE}: -- selection and harvest.
{DIALOGUE}: And the whole, you know, big containers where they mix it.
{DIALOGUE}: We even ate Pinot grapes right off the vine.
{META_DATA}: (the new expert)
{DIALOGUE}: Still a little sour but already showing potential for great structure.
{DIALOGUE}: Stephanie really knows her shit, Miles.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack now has his glass and pours himself some wine.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Where is Stephanie?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Upstairs.
{DIALOGUE}: Getting cleaned up.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: What the fuck are you doing?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: What?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: With this chick.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack just looks at him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Does she know about Saturday?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Um... not exactly.
{DIALOGUE}: But I've been honest.
{DIALOGUE}: I haven't told her I'm available.
{DIALOGUE}: And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days.
{DIALOGUE}: Besides...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack stops short in a rare instance of self-censorship.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Besides what?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: What?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Well, I've been doing some thinking.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, you've been thinking.
{DIALOGUE}: And?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles looks at him with incredulity.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: I fully realize that making a change like that might be tricky for certain people to accept at first, but life is short, Miles.
{DIALOGUE}: I've got to be sure I'm doing the right thing before taking such a big step.
{DIALOGUE}: And not just for my sake.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm thinking about Christine's feelings too.
{DIALOGUE}: I take marriage very seriously -- always have.
{DIALOGUE}: That's why I've never done it before.
{DIALOGUE}: The day I get married, it's going to be the real thing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles just looks at his friend, waiting for more.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes.
{DIALOGUE}: She's not uptight or controlling.
{DIALOGUE}: She's just cool.
{DIALOGUE}: Things are so easy with her.
{DIALOGUE}: Smells different.
{DIALOGUE}: Tastes different.
{DIALOGUE}: Fucks different.
{DIALOGUE}: Fucks like an animal.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles.
{DIALOGUE}: Deep.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Deep.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles draws a long sigh.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Don't get all judgmental on me.
{DIALOGUE}: This is my deal.
{DIALOGUE}: It's my life, and it's my call.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They fall silent for a moment.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: I was hoping to get some understanding from you.
{DIALOGUE}: And I'm not getting it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Understanding of what?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Like I might be in love with another woman.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: In love?
{DIALOGUE}: Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love?
{DIALOGUE}: And give up everything?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Look who's talking.
{DIALOGUE}: You've been there.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man?
{DIALOGUE}: Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do?
{DIALOGUE}: Huh?
{DIALOGUE}: Was it?
{DIALOGUE}: Is she a part of my life now?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: This is totally different.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about.
{DIALOGUE}: That's the distinction.
{DIALOGUE}: I have not made the commitment yet.
{DIALOGUE}: I am not married.
{DIALOGUE}: I have not said the words.
{DIALOGUE}: In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore.
{DIALOGUE}: Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: And what about Stephanie?
{DIALOGUE}: She's a woman -- with a kid.
{DIALOGUE}: A single mom.
{DIALOGUE}: What do you think she's looking for?
{DIALOGUE}: Huh?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{META_DATA}: (interrupting)
{DIALOGUE}: Here's what I'm thinking.
{DIALOGUE}: We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard.
{DIALOGUE}: You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side.
{DIALOGUE}: Then you get inspired and write a new novel.
{DIALOGUE}: As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away.
{DIALOGUE}: Not even.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: You're crazy.
{DIALOGUE}: You've gone crazy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: What do you care anyway?
{DIALOGUE}: You don't even like Christine.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: What?
{DIALOGUE}: Of course I like Christine.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: You said she was shallow.
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: That was three years ago after that first party!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor.
{DIALOGUE}: All I have is my instinct.
{META_DATA}: (his hand on his chest)
{DIALOGUE}: My intuition -- that's all I have.
{DIALOGUE}: And you're asking me to go against it.
{DIALOGUE}: And that's just wrong.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just then Stephanie walks in.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She cozies up to Jack, and he kisses the top of her head.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHANIE
{DIALOGUE}: Hi, guys.
{DIALOGUE}: We should probably get going.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Where?
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. BOWLING ALLEY - DUSK

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A delighted Siena laughs and giggles.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles sits nearby with Stephanie and her fifty-something, two-pack-a-day MOTHER CARYL.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CARYL
{DIALOGUE}: Stephanie's heard this a thousand times, but if I'd done what I wanted and I'd bought up in Santa Maria when I had the chance, I would have made a fortune when they put in that outlet center and that Home Depot.
{DIALOGUE}: (a drag off her cigarette, then to Stephanie) Your father knew it too, but he was a fucking chickenshit.
{DIALOGUE}: Always was.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Caryl looks over her shoulder, her gaze drawn to Jack and Siena, so completely happy together.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Caryl exhales a puff of smoke as she watches.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Stephanie is equally enthralled.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles takes it all in, trying his best not to shake his head in disgust.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{META_DATA}: (dispirited)
{DIALOGUE}: Sure, whatever.
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe I'll catch a movie.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Stephanie kisses Miles's cheek before getting in the car next to her mom.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHANIE
{DIALOGUE}: See you, Miles.
{DIALOGUE}: You take care.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Bye, Stephanie.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A TOUR BUS, whose flank reads "Solvang Wine Tours," is in the process of letting out WINE TOURISTS, many of them elderly.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. LARGE WINERY - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The room boasts not only a large TASTING BAR but also display after display of t-shirts, golf shirts, olive oils, chocolate sauces and other gourmet tourist items emblazoned with the winery's logo.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In the corner an ACOUSTIC GUITARIST with a small amp plays soothing Windham Hill-ish music.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The tasting bar is packed three-deep with TASTERS attended to by HARRIED POURERS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Finally the POURER gets to their glasses.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles chews a sip and swallows, then downs the rest in a single gulp.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus.
{DIALOGUE}: Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit.
{DIALOGUE}: Fucking Raid.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{DIALOGUE}: Tastes okay to me.
{META_DATA}: (looking at the tasting sheet)
{DIALOGUE}: Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Let me use your phone.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{META_DATA}: (handing it over)
{DIALOGUE}: What's up?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: I can't take it anymore.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Good, good.
{DIALOGUE}: Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know.
{DIALOGUE}: So what's happening?
{DIALOGUE}: Still no word?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
{DIALOGUE}: Actually there is word.
{DIALOGUE}: I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: And?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
{DIALOGUE}: And... they're passing.
{DIALOGUE}: Conundrum's passing.
{DIALOGUE}: He said they really liked it.
{DIALOGUE}: They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it.
{DIALOGUE}: He said it was a tough call.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Huh.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
{DIALOGUE}: I'm sorry, Miles.
{META_DATA}: (off his silence)
{DIALOGUE}: So I don't know where that leaves us.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it.
{DIALOGUE}: I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home.
{DIALOGUE}: The whole industry's gotten gutless.
{DIALOGUE}: It's not about the quality of the books.
{DIALOGUE}: It's about the marketing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles is at a loss for words.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A distant RUMBLE begins to sound, the familiar harbinger of an anxiety attack.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. DEEP CANYON - INSERT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Once again we see the narrow ROPE BRIDGE extending vertiginously across a great CHASM.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. LARGE WINERY - BACK AGAIN

{DIALOGUE}: You've been a real trooper.
{META_DATA}: (loudly, to her assistant)
{DIALOGUE}: Tell him I'll call back.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: So I guess that's it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
{DIALOGUE}: You're a wonderful writer, Miles.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't be discouraged.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MOMENTS LATER --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles STAGGERS toward the tasting room, unpocketing his Xanax and downing a couple, as Evelyn's clichs of consolation continue in his head.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
{DIALOGUE}: Just hang in there, and who knows?
{DIALOGUE}: After you get something else published, we can revisit this one.
{DIALOGUE}: And next time we can try a different title.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Once back at the tent, he leans against it in a vain attempt to steady himself.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The RUMBLE grows deafening.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. LARGE WINERY - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now inside, Miles grabs the first DIRTY WINE GLASS he finds and shakes it out as he approaches the closest tasting station.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pushes his way to front.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The pourer offers the usual one-ounce dollop.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles jacks it back, immediately extending his glass for more.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Hit me again.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The same small amount is poured and downed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Once again Miles holds out his glass.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Pour me a full glass.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll pay for it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: POURER
{DIALOGUE}: This is a tasting, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: Not a bar.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles slams a TWENTY-DOLLAR BILL on the table.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Just give me a full goddamn pour.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The pourer turns away to serve another party.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles looks around indignantly, as though everyone should be sympathetic to this injustice.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now Miles boldly reaches over and pours himself a glass right up to the brim and beyond.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: POURER
{DIALOGUE}: Sir, what are you doing?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: I told you I need a drink.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: POURER
{DIALOGUE}: Then buy a bottle and go outside.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The pourer grabs Miles by the wrist before he can drink.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: POURER
{DIALOGUE}: Put the glass down.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In the ensuing struggle, the wine spills, and everyone nearby steps back.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: POURER
{DIALOGUE}: You're going to have to leave, sir.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The pourer signals to a SECURITY GUY at the door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Across the room Jack notices the disturbance and heads over.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles hoists up the SPIT BUCKET, holds it aloft and starts to GUZZLE it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wine cascades down the sides of his face, onto his shirt and even onto his shiny new shoes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Security Guy yanks the bucket away from Miles, and drags him toward the EXIT.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack catches up.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Just write another one.
{DIALOGUE}: You have lots of ideas, right?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: No, I'm finished.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not a writer.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm a middle-school English teacher.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others.
{DIALOGUE}: It's okay.
{DIALOGUE}: I like books.
{DIALOGUE}: The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm unnecessary.
{META_DATA}: (a dark laugh)
{DIALOGUE}: I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: What's that supposed to mean?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz.
{DIALOGUE}: You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces?
{DIALOGUE}: He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Thanks.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Don't give up.
{DIALOGUE}: You're going to make it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: See?
{DIALOGUE}: Right there.
{DIALOGUE}: Just what you just said.
{DIALOGUE}: That's beautiful.
{DIALOGUE}: A thumbprint on a skyscraper.
{DIALOGUE}: I couldn't write that.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: seated halfway up on the motel stairs, her HELMET in her lap, watching patiently as --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE SAAB
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: pulls to a stop in a parking space.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{META_DATA}: (calling out)
{DIALOGUE}: Hey, baby.

{DIALOGUE}: Stop!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHANIE

{DIALOGUE}: I can explain.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHANIE
{DIALOGUE}: You said you loved me!
{DIALOGUE}: You fuck!
{DIALOGUE}: I hope you die!

{CHARACTER_NAME}: STEPHANIE
{DIALOGUE}: Fuckface!
{META_DATA}: (to Miles)
{DIALOGUE}: You too!

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Don't need a lecture.
{DIALOGUE}: You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: No, I did not.
{DIALOGUE}: Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post.
{DIALOGUE}: I think we mentioned it to him the first night.

{DIALOGUE}: Please leave a message.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: It's Miles.
{DIALOGUE}: Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did.
{DIALOGUE}: I think you're great, Maya -- always have.
{DIALOGUE}: From the first time you waited on me.
{META_DATA}: (bracing himself)
{DIALOGUE}: And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published.
{DIALOGUE}: I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong.
{DIALOGUE}: Again.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do.
{DIALOGUE}: So you see I'm not much of a writer.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not anything really.
{DIALOGUE}: The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand.
{DIALOGUE}: We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm sorry.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm really sorry.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: What else to say?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He hangs up.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He returns to his seat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A moment later he extends his legs to look at his new SHOES now STAINED WITH WINE.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: LATER --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack emerges unsteadily from the bowels of the emergency room, his face purple and swollen beneath the HUGE WHITE BANDAGE that holds the NOSEGUARD in place.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles walks with him toward the exit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Well?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: I'm going to need an operation.
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe a couple of them.

{DIALOGUE}: Then they break it again.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Good thing you have a voice-over career.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Gonna fuck that up too.
{DIALOGUE}: I should sue her ass.
{DIALOGUE}: Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: That's thoughtful.

{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They walk by us and out the door.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. STREET IN SOLVANG - DAY

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When his agony allows him to open his eyes, he glares at the DANISH THEMED STORES lining the street.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An ABELSKIVER MAKER plies his lofty trade in a nearby window.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He hears a strange CLOMPING NOISE and turns his head to see a MAN IN WOODEN CLOGS walking noisily down the street, dressed in a TRADITIONAL DANISH COSTUME and carrying a TUBA.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack takes a slug of wine.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just then Miles gets back in the car.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: Sure I'm sure.
{DIALOGUE}: And just what are you implying?
{DIALOGUE}: I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth.
{DIALOGUE}: What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you?
{DIALOGUE}: You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal.
{DIALOGUE}: Not by a longshot.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack takes a long lie-detecting look at Miles.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A TOOTHPICK DISPENSER as a finger tips it forward to dispense one.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WIDER --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Miles stands by the cash register and PICKS HIS TEETH as he watches Jack finish speaking with Cammi and head his way.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES
{DIALOGUE}: You're joking, right?
{META_DATA}: (seeing that he isn't)
{DIALOGUE}: What are you doing?
{DIALOGUE}: Un-fucking- believeable.
{DIALOGUE}: Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jack rests one hand on Miles's shoulder and drops his head, thinking how best to put it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Look, Miles.
{DIALOGUE}: I know you're my friend and you care about me.
{DIALOGUE}: And I know you disapprove.
{DIALOGUE}: I respect that.
{DIALOGUE}: But there are some things I have to do that you don't understand.
{DIALOGUE}: You understand wine and literature and movies, but you don't understand my plight.
{DIALOGUE}: And that's okay.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLOSE ON MILES --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as the disappointment in his friend deepens by the moment.
{META_DATA}: FADE TO BLACK:

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: You don't understand.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JACK
{DIALOGUE}: Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILES

{DIALOGUE}: Thanks for your letter.
{DIALOGUE}: I would have called you sooner, but I think I've needed some time to think about everything that happened and what you wrote to me.
