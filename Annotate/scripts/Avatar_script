{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He leans down and grabs one leg of the man's barstool -- and YANKS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The chair flips.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The guy goes down HARD and --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: JAKE hurls himself from the wheelchair, toppling on the guy, getting a grip on him like a pit bull and PUNCHING the crap out of him, right there on the floor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE BOUNCER jumps in, trying to drag him off and it goes into SLOW MOTION, everybody yelling and pulling...

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JAKE (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Me -- I was just another dumb grunt gettin' sent someplace I was gonna regret.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There are waterfalls, rivers, and distant flocks of WINGED CREATURES.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly the carpet of virgin rainforest gives way to --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: AN OPEN-PIT MINE.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A lifeless crater -- as if a giant cookie- cutter took a chunk out of the world.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: CREW CHIEF
{DIALOGUE}: Exopack on, let's go!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: BENEATH THE SHUTTLE air blasts outward for a hundred meter radius as it settles onto its landing gear.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INSIDE everybody is queued up in the aisles, with duffles ready.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Rows of tense, expectant faces in breathing masks -- and we DIP DOWN to find Jake, wheelchair putting him at the level of everyone else's WAISTS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 8.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE CARGO RAMP OPENS with a hydraulic whine.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CREW CHIEF

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jake, pumping his chair, looks around as --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A huge TRACTOR, taller than a house, ROARS past on muddy wheels.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He notices something sticking in the tires -- ARROWS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The neolithic weapons are jarring amid all the advanced technology.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beyond the tractor, two VTOL vehicles take off.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A STINGBAT.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WAINFLEET casually BLASTS IT with his PISTOL.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It drops off the fence, tail still lashing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WAINFLEET
{DIALOGUE}: Seen a lotta guys leave this place in a wheelchair.
{DIALOGUE}: Never seen anybody show up in one.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jake stares at the gnashing fangs of the dying alien.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ON A WALKWAY of the OPS CENTER, seen from above, a UNIFORMED FIGURE grips the railing, watching Jake pump his chair through the tunnel below.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The hair is clipped short.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The scalp is etched by long parallel SCARS where some Pandoran denizen's claws raked across it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The bare arms, below tightly rolled sleeves, seem hewn out of some hard tropical wood.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Criss-crossed by scars.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The MAN raises his masked face to look at the sky.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: JAKE ROLLS IN, watching from the back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: COLONEL QUARITCH raises his hand and points out the window, toward the dark treeline.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: QUARITCH
{DIALOGUE}: Out beyond that fence every living thing that crawls, flies or squats in the mud wants to kill you and eat your eyes for jujubees.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The room gets very quiet.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: QUARITCH
{DIALOGUE}: We have an indigenous population of humanoids here called the Na'vi.
{DIALOGUE}: They're fond of arrows dipped in a neurotoxin which can stop your heart in one minute.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A very large, very blue, man.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Blood circulates through a synthetic UMBILICAL in the abdomen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the figure turns in the amniotic fluid, we see that it has a lemur-like TAIL.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The skin is cyan-blue.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: JAKE'S VOICE-OVER up until now has been part of this VIDEOLOG.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JAKE
{DIALOGUE}: -- so their nervous systems are in tune.
{DIALOGUE}: Or something.
{DIALOGUE}: Which is why they offered me this gig, because I can link with Tommy's avatar, which was insanely expensive.
{META_DATA}: (looking off camera)
{DIALOGUE}: Is this right?
{DIALOGUE}: I just say whatever in these videologs?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WIDER, showing Norm working nearby with Max.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NORM
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: You just need to get in the habit of documenting everything -- what you see, what you feel -- it's all part of the science.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JAKE
{DIALOGUE}: Right.
