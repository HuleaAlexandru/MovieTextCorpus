{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: First Draft
{META_DATA}: 11/4/97
{META_DATA}: "We each owe a death, there are no exceptions..."
{META_DATA}: A SONG BEGINS, distant as a faded memory on an old Victrola:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Once I built a railroad, made it run... Made it race against time...Once I built a railroad, now it's done...Brother, can you spare a dime...
{META_DATA}: Opening credit sequence
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: plays against footage of the Great Depression, images haunting and sepia-toned, defining an era.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The bread lines...the soup kitchens...the dust bowl refugees heading west with their possessions on their backs and no hope in their eyes...the strutting gangster royalty flaunting their bootleg riches...an entire generation of lost youth riding the rials...the U.S. army troops raining truncheon blows on the half-starved and forgotten veterans of World War One as "Hooverville" is set afire in the very shadow of the nation's capitol...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All these faces, all these lives, in a world not really so very long ago...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. FIELD - DAY(SLOW MOTION)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...where cattails sway in the sepia-toned heat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A small scrap of fabric is snagged in the nettles, fluttering languidly...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: COLOR BLEEDS SLOWLY IN as mosquitoes swarm and dragonflies skitter, showing the fabric scrap to be pale yellow...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, a MAN WITH A SHOTGUN comes crashing through the cattails, wiping through frame and exiting...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...then ANOTHER MAN...and ANOTHER...armed with rifles, plowing through the brush, exiting frame...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and now comes KLAUS DETTERICK, a farmer one step above shirt-tail poor, a double-barrel shotgun in the crook of his arm.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pauses, horrified, seeing the scrap of cloth.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pulls it loose, turns back, screaming something in anguish...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and still more men come crashing into view, flooding by us with dreamlike, slow-motion grace.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ONE MAN is leading a team of DOGS, trying to untangle the leads.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: DEPUTY ROB McGEE is shouting for everybody to stay together...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and under it all, we hear a sibilant, frightening whisper:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: You love your sister?
{DIALOGUE}: You make any noise, know what happens?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And off that horrible voice, we
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. GEORGIA PINES NURSING HOME - MORNING(PRESENT DAY)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A CLOCK RADIO spews the morning weather report, abruptly pulling us into the present with a prediction of rain.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: PAUL EDGECOMB, late 70's/early 80's, wakes to another day...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. PAUL'S ROOM - MORNING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul stands at his bathroom mirror, meticulously buttoning his shirt.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He picks up a hairbrush, starts tidying his hair...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. CORRIDOR - MORNING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE OLD AND INFIRM haunt these corridors like ghosts.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A WOMAN inches along on a walker.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A MAN shuffles by with a rolling I.V. stand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The floor is a limey, institutional green.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul comes into view, spry for his age, murmurs an occasional greeting.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - MORNING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: DOZENS OF RETIREES are having breakfast, sipping weak coffee or tea.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Some chat and gossip, other are content to keep their own company, some just stare slackly into space.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul enters, sees ELAINE CONNELLY sitting with a few other ladies, sipping tea.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She's 80, refined and elegant, his best friend here.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She gives him a good-morning smile.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He gives her a rakish wink in return, which makes her smiles all the more.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul reaches past the people at the counter and sneaks two pieces of cold leftover toast off a serving plate.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He tosses Elaine another look--catch ya later--and exits.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. HALLWAY PAST KITCHEN - MORNING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul slips to the back door unnoticed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Identical red plastic rain ponchos line the wall on pegs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He helps himself to one and eases outside, making good his escape.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. NURSING HOME - ESTABLISHING - MORNING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Nestled in a valley of wooded hills, a drizzly mist rolling over the treetops.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul appears f.g., coming up the ridge in his borrowed poncho.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks back at the valley below, inhales deeply-- this is a man who loves his walks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pulls a piece of toast from his pocket and starts to nibble as he presses up on the ridge...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Low angle: nursing home and ridge beyond
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and we see Paul from a distance, just a speck trudging up toward the treeline.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A PICKUP TRUCK rumbles into frame and parks, a bumper sticker looming large: "I Have Seen God and His Name Is Newt Gingrich".
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: BRAD DOLAN gets out, an orderly in his late 20's/early 30's, arriving for work in jeans and cheesy plaid shirt.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He gazes up toward the ridge, scowling and muttering softly:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRAD
{DIALOGUE}: Old fuck.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He slams the door and heads for the nursing home...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. WOODS - MORNING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...as CAMERA BOOMS DOWN through the trees to find Paul wandering a wooded path, munching a tidbit of toast, looking for all the world like Red Riding Hood in his plastic poncho.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's silent here, like a church.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The only sounds we hear are the twittering of the birds and the hammering of the woodpecker.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A RUSTLING SOUND makes Paul freeze.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns, becomes transfixed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Softly:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, my...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Reverse angle
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: reveals a magnificent BUCK, not twenty feet away, misty breath punching the cold morning air.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They watch each other for an endless moment, both standing stock still...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and then the animal bounds away, vanishing into the foliage.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul lets out a breath, shakes his head in wonder.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes another bite of toast, moves on...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and WE PAN WITH HIM to reveal a pair of old wooden storage shacks along the path up ahead.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SHACK - MORNING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dark in here, cobwebby and decrepit.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see Paul approaching outside the grimy window.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He steps up to the glass and shades his eyes, peering curiously in as we
{META_DATA}: DISSOLVE TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. NURSING HOME - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul approaches the back door, returning from his walk.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He reaches for the knob...and a figure in white lunges from behind the dumpster to grab his wrist.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He whirls, gasping in fright--it's Brad Dolan, wearing his orderly's uniform.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRAD
{DIALOGUE}: Out for a little stroll, Paulie?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Let go...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul tries to pull away, but Dolan's got him tight.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRAD
{DIALOGUE}: What's with this poncho you got on, huh?
{DIALOGUE}: This isn't yours.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: I got it off the wall there.
{DIALOGUE}: There's a whole row of them.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRAD
{DIALOGUE}: But not for you, Paulie, that's the thing.
{DIALOGUE}: Those are for the staff.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: I just borrowed it.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't see what harm it does.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRAD
{DIALOGUE}: It's not about harm, it's about rules.
{DIALOGUE}: You probably don't think an old fart like you has to mind rules anymore, but that's just not true.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brad's eyes keep shifting--he obviously doesn't mind abusing the elderly as long as he doesn't get caught doing it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: I'm sorry if I broke the rules.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRAD
{DIALOGUE}: You got no business up in those woods anyway, especially in the rain.
{DIALOGUE}: What if you fall and bust a hip, huh?
{DIALOGUE}: Who you think's gonna have to hoss your sorry old bacon back down here?
{DIALOGUE}: Me, that's who.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: You're hurting me!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRAD
{DIALOGUE}: What do you do up there, anyway?
{DIALOGUE}: You're too old to go jerk off, so what do you do?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Nothing.
{DIALOGUE}: I just walk, that's all, I like to walk!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brad lashes out and grabs Paul's other hand, which he's been holding tightly clenched shut.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRAD
{DIALOGUE}: Come on.
{DIALOGUE}: Open up.
{DIALOGUE}: Let Poppa see.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul uncurls his fingers, revealing the crushed remnants of a bit of toast, his palm slick with a greasy oleo smear.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ELAINE (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: Paul?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They turn.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Elaine stands just inside the screen door with a cup of tea.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brad's eyes become calculated, wondering how much she's seen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Elaine keeps her tone level, betraying nothing:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ELAINE
{DIALOGUE}: I saw you coming back, thought you'd like some tea.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Are you coming in?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Mr. Dolan and I were...chatting.
{DIALOGUE}: About the weather.
{DIALOGUE}: I think we're through now.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brad lets Paul loose, leans close:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRAD
{DIALOGUE}: Paulie?
{DIALOGUE}: You tell anyone I squeezed your po' ol' hand, I'll tell 'em you're having senile delusions.
{DIALOGUE}: Who you think they'll believe?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brad walks off.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul turns, watches him go.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The screen door opens and Elaine steps out, her face pale.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul gives her a strained, though grateful, smile as we
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. TV ROOM - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jerry Springer's on the tube, whipping his studio audience into a frenzy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: PAN OFF TO REVEAL DOZENS OF OLD FOLKS watching on couches and folding chairs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An old black fellow named PETE is grousing to a GROUP OF ELDERLY LADIES...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PETE
{DIALOGUE}: Why we always watch this crap?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ELDERLY LADY #1
{DIALOGUE}: It's interesting.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PETE
{DIALOGUE}: Interesting?
{DIALOGUE}: Bunch'a inbred trailer trash, all they ever talk about is fucking...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and WE CONTINUE PANNING to Paul and Elaine sitting near the back, talking quietly as Paul rubs his bruised hand:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ELAINE
{DIALOGUE}: We should report him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: That might just provoke him all the more, make things worse for everybody.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ELAINE
{DIALOGUE}: It's not everybody he has it in for, Paul.
{DIALOGUE}: It's you.
{META_DATA}: (off his look)
{DIALOGUE}: What did you do to provoke him in the first place?
{DIALOGUE}: Nothing.
{DIALOGUE}: He's just an abusive bully, and should be made to stop.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Ellie, please...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Pete
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: is at the TV, switching channels while:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ELDERLY LADIES
{DIALOGUE}: ...no, the Movie Classic channel is further down...past the Home Shopping...keep going...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He finds the Movie Classic channel, which is playing an old black and white musical--"Top Hat," with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A delighted reaction:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ELDERLY LADY #2
{DIALOGUE}: Oh!
{DIALOGUE}: This is wonderful...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: idly shifts his gaze to the TV...and his expression goes slack with recognition and dismay.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Elaine sees the look in his eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He glances away...even briefly considers walking out...but in the end, he can't help himself.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The past just caught up with him with a freight-train wallop, and, for one, he decides to ride the rails...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks back at the TV.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On screen, Fred and Ginger have begun their famous "Cheek to Cheek" number, with Astaire singing in that sublime, easy-go-lucky way of his:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FRED ASTAIRE
{DIALOGUE}: Heaven, I'm in heaven...and my heart beat so that I can hardly speak...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SLOW PUSH IN on Paul, watching.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He'd like to take his eyes off the screen, but the movie has him in a grip tighter than Brad Dolan's.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Elaine is watching him with puzzled concern:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ELAINE
{DIALOGUE}: Paul?
{DIALOGUE}: What is it?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: No response.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All he can hear is that music, all he can see are those dancers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The figures on TV are gliding with ghostlike grace in their silvery, phosphor-dot world of long ago...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul abruptly bursts into tears.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The room goes quiet, everything comes to a standstill.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All eyes turn, some concerned, others merely curious.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul just sits sobbing into his hands, shoulders heaving.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ELAINE
{DIALOGUE}: Paul...my God...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ORDERLY
{META_DATA}: (rushing over)
{DIALOGUE}: What is it?
{DIALOGUE}: What's wrong?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: It's okay...I'll be okay...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Another orderly appears--Brad Dolan.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He puts his hand on Paul's shoulder and leans close, feigning concern.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRAD
{DIALOGUE}: S'matter, Paulie?
{DIALOGUE}: Why the boo-hoo- hoo?
{DIALOGUE}: Something nasty happen?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Elaine shoves his hand away, eyes flashing with anger.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ELAINE
{DIALOGUE}: Mr. Edgecomb will be perfectly fine without your help, thank you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brad back off with a "hey, suit yourself" gesture.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Elaine helps Paul to his feet and leads him out.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SUN ROOM - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul is staring out the windows, pensive and drained.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's raining now, pattering the glass and the lawn beyond.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Elaine waits across from him, wishing he would speak.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Softly:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: I guess sometimes the past just catches up with you, whether you want it to or not.
{DIALOGUE}: It's silly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ELAINE
{DIALOGUE}: Was it the film?
{META_DATA}: (off his look)
{DIALOGUE}: It was, wasn't it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: I haven't spoken of these things in a long time, Ellie.
{DIALOGUE}: Over sixty years.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She reaches out, gently takes his hand.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ELAINE
{DIALOGUE}: Paul.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm your friend.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{DIALOGUE}: Yes you are.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul wonders if he's even up to talking about it after all this time...and decides that perhaps he is:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: I ever tell you I was a prison guard during the depression?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ELAINE
{DIALOGUE}: You've mentioned it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Did I mention I was in charge of death row?
{DIALOGUE}: That I supervised all the executions?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This does come as a surprise.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She shakes her head.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: They usually call death row the Last Mile, but we called ours the Green Mile, because the floor was the color of faded limes.
{DIALOGUE}: We had the electric chair then.
{DIALOGUE}: Old Sparky, we called it.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: I've lived a lot of years, Ellie, but 1935 takes the prize.
{DIALOGUE}: That was the year I had the worst urinary infection of my life.
{DIALOGUE}: That was also the year of John Coffey, and the two dead girls...
{META_DATA}: FADE TO BLACK
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In blackness, a title card appears:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: "The Two Dead Girls"
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. GEORGIA COUNTRYSIDE - DAY (1935)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: HUNDREDS OF PRISONERS work the fields, pickaxes rising and falling in waves, a prison song being sung in cadence with the work.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: GUARDS patrol on horseback, rifles aimed at the sky.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A late 20's Ford PRISON TRUCK comes chugging into view along the road, kicking up a long trail of dust in the heat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It seems to be riding unusually low on its rear suspension.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN PENITENTIARY - ESTABLISHING - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A Depression-era prison in the south.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The prison truck sways down the rutted dirt road toward the main gate...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. E BLOCK TOILET - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...while Paul Edgecomb, early 40's, stands in a cramped toilet in his guard's uniform, trying to piss.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His face is pained, his forehead beaded with sweat.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. E BLOCK (THE GREEN MILE) - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: BRUTUS HOWELL(nicknamed "Brutal" for his intimidating size, but he's actually rather thoughtful by nature) stands at the entry door of the cellblock, peering out through a viewing slot.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He sees the prison truck arrive at the main gate.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns and nods to fellow guard DEAN STANTON sitting at the duty desk, then cross the Green Mile--a wide corridor of faded green linoleum running some sixty paces top to bottom, with four large cells to a side.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brutal steps to the bathroom, listen a moment, knocks softly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL
{DIALOGUE}: Paul?
{DIALOGUE}: Prisoner.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: Christ.
{DIALOGUE}: Gimme a minute.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brutal waits patiently, a bit embarrassed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He finally hears a THIN TRICKLE, accompanied by a stifled groan of pain.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL
{DIALOGUE}: You all right in there?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: For a man pissing razor blades.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The door opens, revealing Paul's pale and sweaty face.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL
{DIALOGUE}: You should'a took the day off, gone to see the doctor.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: With a new arrival?
{DIALOGUE}: You know better.
{DIALOGUE}: Besides, it's not as bad as it was.
{DIALOGUE}: I think it's clearing up.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They hear the truck HONKING as it rumbles up outside.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul gives them a nod to resume their positions.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul walks down the Mile, passing the cells where two inmates reside--the first is ARLEN BITTERBUCK, a Washita Cherokee; the second is EDUARD DELACROIX("DEL"), a skinny Cajun.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEL
{DIALOGUE}: New boy coming in, boss?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Never you mind, Del, you just keep your nose quietly on your business.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul arrives at the end of the Mile, takes up a position at an empty cell.
{META_DATA}: (Down at this end, past the cells, is E Block's version of the "hole" -- a padded room where violent inmates are sent to cool off.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It isn't used very often...in fact, at the moment, it's doubling as storage space.)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brutal
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: peers out the viewing slot as the truck stops outside.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL
{DIALOGUE}: Damn, they're riding on the axle.
{DIALOGUE}: What'd they do, bust the springs?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: GUARDS PERCY WETMORE AND HARRY TERWILLIGER OF E BLOCK emerge from the back of the truck and step down, turn back...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Tighter angle on back of truck
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We get our first glimpse of the new inmate as a pair of GIGANTIC BLACK FEET step down into the yard...and the rear of the truck bounces back up on its springs where it belongs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brutal
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: sees what's coming, eyes widening slightly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL
{DIALOGUE}: Paul?
{DIALOGUE}: You might wanna reconsider getting in the cell with this guy?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Why's that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL
{DIALOGUE}: He's enormous.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Can't be bigger than you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brutal tosses him a look--just wait.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He swings the door open in a hot flood of daylight, giving us our first good look at:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John coffey
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: is a huge black man, nearly 7 feet tall and 300 pounds, his massive head shiny and bald, his skin a tapestry of old scars, his prison overalls (the biggest size they had) ending at mid-calf.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks dull and confused, as if wondering where he is and how he got there.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy and Harry lead him toward E Block in shackles.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy's got his hickory baton out of it custom-made holster, hollering:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PERCY
{DIALOGUE}: Dead man walking!
{DIALOGUE}: Dead man walking here!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Inside the cellblock
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul can't see them approach from where he stands, but he can certainly hear Percy:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Jeezus, pleeze-us, what the hell's he yelling about?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Up by the door, Brutal just rolls his eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy is the first one through the door, still hollering...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PERCY
{DIALOGUE}: Dead man walking!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...then Coffey enters, ducking low to get through, his shadow blotting out Brutal and Dean as his massive frame fills the door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everything hangs suspended for a moment, a look of "hold shit" written on everybody's faces.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy keeps yanking on the big man's cuffs, leading him along with a cry of:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PERCY
{DIALOGUE}: Dead man walking!
{DIALOGUE}: Dead man--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Percy, that's enough.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy falls reproachfully silent.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul doesn't dignify it, just motions for them to come on.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The procession comes down the Mile, with Brutal and Dean bringing up rear.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL
{DIALOGUE}: You sure you wanna be in there with him?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{META_DATA}: (looks to Coffey)
{DIALOGUE}: Am I gonna have trouble with you, big boy?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey shakes his head slowly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul takes the clipboard transfer papers from Harry, turns and enters the cell.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey just stands outside the cell and waits, as if he doesn't understand the concept.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul motions him to come on in.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey starts to comply, but Percy raps him smartly with the tip of his hickory baton to get him moving faster.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey flinches, enters the cell.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul stares angrily at Percy, who stands slapping his hickory baton against the palm of his hand like a man with a toy he's itching to use.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Percy.
{DIALOGUE}: They're moving house over in the infirmary.
{DIALOGUE}: Why don't you go see if they could use some help?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PERCY
{DIALOGUE}: They got all the men they need.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Why don't you just go make sure?
{META_DATA}: (off his look)
{DIALOGUE}: I don't care where you go, Percy, as long as it's not here at this very moment.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy flushes red, the baton hovering near his palm.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks like he's about to say something, but thinks better of it and stalks angrily up the Mile instead...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and sees Del at his bars, smiling.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Infuriated, Percy swings his baton and smashes Del's fingers with a LOUD CRACK.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Del jerks back, howling in pain:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEL
{DIALOGUE}: OWW, GOD, HE BUS' MY FINGERS!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PERCY
{DIALOGUE}: Wiped that grin off your shitpoke face, didn't I
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Goddamn it, Percy!
{DIALOGUE}: Get the hell off my block!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy throws Paul a look of disdain--your block, huh?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He swaggers out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Del's on his knees, weeping from the pain:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEL
{DIALOGUE}: Oww, damn, boss, he done bus' my fingers for true...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: We'll get it looked at, Del, now keep yourself quiet like I said!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Del falls silent, moaning over his hand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul turns to Coffey, who looks unsettled by all the commotion.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: If I let Harry take those chains off you, you gonna be nice?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey nods.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Harry enters to remove Coffey's shackles.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Your name is John Coffey.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY
{META_DATA}: (deep and quiet)
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, sir, boss, like the drink, only not spelt the same.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: So you can spell, can you?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey shakes his head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Harry steps out.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: My name is Paul Edgecomb.
{DIALOGUE}: If I'm not here, you can ask for Mr. Terwilliger, Mr. Howell, or Mr. Stanton...those gentlemen there.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: This isn't like the rest of the prison.
{DIALOGUE}: It's a quiet place, we like to keep it that way.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey considers this carefully, puzzled.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY
{DIALOGUE}: It weren't me making all the noise, boss.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{META_DATA}: (eyes narrowing)
{DIALOGUE}: You having a joke on me, John Coffey?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY
{DIALOGUE}: No, sir.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul sees he isn't joking, continues:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Your time here can be easy or hard, depends on you.
{DIALOGUE}: If you behave, you get to walk in the exercise yard every day.
{DIALOGUE}: We might even play some music on the radio from time to time.
{DIALOGUE}: Questions?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey doesn't miss a beat, as if he's been waiting to ask:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY
{DIALOGUE}: Do you leave a light on after bedtime?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul blinks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's the last thing he expected.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey smiles uneasily, as if they might think him foolish for asking.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY
{DIALOGUE}: Because I get a little scared in the dark sometimes.
{DIALOGUE}: If it's a strange place.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul looks to his men.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The guards are trading glances.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: It's pretty bright in here all night long.
{DIALOGUE}: We keep half the lights burning in the corridor.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY
{DIALOGUE}: Cor'der.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey looks confused.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul points to the lights lining the ceiling of the Green Mile in wire mesh cages.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Right out there.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey nods, relieved.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he surprises everybody by offering Paul his hand, as if to show proper manners.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul hesitates, oddly touched, then surprised his men even more by accepting.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey's hand swallows his.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey shakes gently, lets go.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul steps from the cell.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brutal slides the door shut, locks it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey stands a moment as if unsure what to do, then sinks onto the cot with his hands clasped between his knees.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks up at Paul, his voice soft as a whisper:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and they stop, gazing in horror:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John Coffey sits on the riverbank in bloody overalls, his huge feet splayed out before him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's making that inhuman howling sound, face twisted in monstrous grief, pausing occasionally to take in a great hitching breath of air.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Curled in his massive arms are the naked bodies of Detterick's 9 year-old twin girls, their once-blonde hair now matted to their heads with blood.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: You didn't come all the way down here just to hand me a D.O.E.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAL
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: I had an angry call from the state capital about twenty minutes ago.
{DIALOGUE}: Is it true you ordered Percy Wetmore off the block.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: It is.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAL
{DIALOGUE}: I'm sure you had reason, but like it or not, the wife of the governor of this state has only one nephew, and his name happens to be Percy Wetmore.
{DIALOGUE}: I need to tell you how this lays out?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Little Percy called his aunt and squealed like a schoolroom sissy.
{META_DATA}: (Hal nods)
{DIALOGUE}: He also mention he assaulted a prisoner this morning out of sheer petulance?
{DIALOGUE}: Broke three fingers on Eduard Delacroix's left hand.

{DIALOGUE}: I'm sure she didn't either.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL

{DIALOGUE}: Bad combination in a place like this.
{DIALOGUE}: Sooner or later, he's gonna get somebody hurt.
{DIALOGUE}: Or worse.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAL
{DIALOGUE}: You and Brutus Howell will make sure that doesn't happen.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Easy enough to say.
{DIALOGUE}: We can't watch him every minute, Hal.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAL
{DIALOGUE}: Stick with it.
{DIALOGUE}: May not be much longer.
{DIALOGUE}: I have it on good authority that Percy has an application in at Briar Ridge.

{DIALOGUE}: The mental hospital?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAL
{META_DATA}: (nods)
{DIALOGUE}: Administration job.
{DIALOGUE}: Better pay.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Then why's he still here?
{DIALOGUE}: He could get that application pushed through...hell, with his connections, he could have any state job he wants.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hal has no answer.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul look off toward Bitterbuck.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Tell you what I think.
{DIALOGUE}: I think he just wants to see one cook up close.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hal follows Paul's gaze, takes his meaning.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAL
{DIALOGUE}: Well, he'll get his chance then, won't he?
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe then he'll be satisfied and move on.
{DIALOGUE}: In the meantime, you'll keep the peace.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Of course.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAL
{DIALOGUE}: Thank you, Paul.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hal rises, slapping yard dust off his trousers.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: You give Melinda my love, okay?
{DIALOGUE}: I bet that X-ray turns out to be nothing at all.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hal walks off looking like he's got the weight of the world on his shoulders.

{DIALOGUE}: Got a new inmate today.
{DIALOGUE}: Big, simple-minded fella.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JAN
{DIALOGUE}: Do I want to hear what he did?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: No.

{META_DATA}: (softly)
{DIALOGUE}: The things that happen in this world.
{DIALOGUE}: It's a wonder God allows it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She gives him a tiny kiss above his left eyebrow, in that special spot that makes him prickle.

{DIALOGUE}: Why don't you come to bed?
{DIALOGUE}: I've got something to help you sleep, and you can have all you want.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Don't I wish.
{DIALOGUE}: I've still got something wrong with my waterworks, I don't want to pass it on.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JAN
{DIALOGUE}: You see Doc Sadler yet?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: No, because he'll want me to take sulfa tablets and I'll spend the rest of the week puking in every corner of my office.
{DIALOGUE}: It'll run its course all by itself, thank you very much for your concern.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She kisses that spot above his eyebrow again.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He smiles.

{DIALOGUE}: Paul?
{DIALOGUE}: Dean?
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. E BLOCK - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul and Dean enter to find Brutal trying not to wake the cons in their cells by laughing too loudly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They follows his gaze down the Mile, see nothing, turn to him like he's crazy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL
{DIALOGUE}: I guess the legislature loosened those purse-strings enough to hire on a new guard.
{META_DATA}: (off their looks)
{DIALOGUE}: Look again.
{DIALOGUE}: He's right there.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul and Dean look again and this time they see it:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A tiny brown mouse is coming up the Mile.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It trots a short distance, peers right and left as if checking the snoring inmates in their cells, then makes another forward spurt.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: He's doing a cell check.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This gets them all trying not to laugh.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The mouse draws ever closer.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dean starts to look worried.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEAN
{DIALOGUE}: It ain't normal for a mouse to come up on people that way.
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe it's rabid.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, my Christ.
{DIALOGUE}: The big mouse expert.
{DIALOGUE}: The Mouse Man.
{DIALOGUE}: You see it foaming at the mouth, Mouse Man?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEAN
{META_DATA}: (dubious)
{DIALOGUE}: I don't see its mouth at all.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: That does it--Paul and Brutal burst out laughing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The mouse stops before them and peers up, curling its tail primly around its paws as if to wait.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The guards fall silent, fascinated.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bitterbuck stirs in his cell, sits up to watch.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brutal tears off a piece of his half-eaten corned beef sandwich, holds it delicately out with two fingers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The mouse rises up, appraising the morsel with shiny black eyes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEAN
{DIALOGUE}: Aw, Brutal, no!
{DIALOGUE}: We'll be hip-deep in mice around here...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL
{META_DATA}: (to Paul)
{DIALOGUE}: I just wanna see what he'll do.
{DIALOGUE}: In the interests of science, like.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul shrugs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brutal drops the scrap.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The mouse grabs it and eats, sitting up like a dog doing a trick.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The mouse turns and scurries back down the Mile, vanishing under the restraint room door at the far end.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEAN
{DIALOGUE}: He's in the damn restraint room.
{DIALOGUE}: You know he's gonna be chewing the padding out of walls and making himself a nice little nest.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: All right.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brutal shrugs off his jacket.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul grabs a mop from a steel bucket, hands it to Dean.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Dean, watch the door.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brutal and Paul start doing the heavy lifting, muscling an unused filing cabinet out the door...
{META_DATA}: DISSOLVE:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and they finally relay the last few heavy buckets of paint onto the Mile.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul and Brutal catch their breath, scanning the empty restraint room.

{DIALOGUE}: You let him get past you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEAN
{DIALOGUE}: No I didn't, I was here all the time!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL
{DIALOGUE}: Then where the hell is he?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They move slowly into the room, peering into every nook and cranny, utterly mystified.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brutal shakes his head.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL
{DIALOGUE}: Three grown men.
{DIALOGUE}: Outsmarted by a mouse.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEAN
{DIALOGUE}: Well, bright side is, all this commotion probably scared him off for good.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, that's right.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Harry and Bill Dodge are at the desk b.g., doing paperwork and filing chores.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy is idling nearby, whistling softly and combing his hair...

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: stares through his bars as the mouse goes by...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: PERCY

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ANGLE UP to Bitterbuck peering through his bars, watching him go by...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: PERCY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: keeps working that comb--and freezes at the sound of a TINY SQUEAK.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His head swivels slowly...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and there's the mouse.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Staring at him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: That moment of eye contact reveals an enmity older than time itself.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: If mice have a natural enemy, Percy is it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: You little son of a bitch.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Harry and Bill glance up from their work.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRY
{DIALOGUE}: Well, I'll be damned.

{DIALOGUE}: I thought Brutal was pulling my leg.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BILL
{DIALOGUE}: That's a goddamn mouse.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRY
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: Brute said he was in here last night begging for food, came right up to the desk.

{META_DATA}: (Percy's hand inches ever closer to his baton)
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BILL
{DIALOGUE}: Here, lemme try.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bill drops a piece of cracker.

{META_DATA}: (Percy's hand starts easing his baton from its holster.)
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BILL
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe he's full.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRY

{DIALOGUE}: Gotta be an E Block regular to feed the E Block mouse, don'cha know...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Harry drops another piece--and sure enough, the mouse starts to eat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Harry's smile fades.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He and Bill trade a look.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRY
{DIALOGUE}: I was just kidding ab--
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy lets rip a BELLOWING WAR CRY ("Yaaaahhh!")
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: and launches his baton like a spear, scaring the crap out of everyone.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The mouse ducks (yes, actually ducks) and the baton sail over his head close enough to ruffle its fur, bouncing off the floor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Apparently remembering a pressing engagement elsewhere, the mouse takes off in a flash toward the restraint room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy roars with frustration and takes off after it, trying to squash it with his heavy work shoes, leaping and stomping with great big galloping strides, missing the mouse by inches...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and thus is the Green Mile traversed, with Percy stomping and hollering like a spastic flamenco dancer, the convicts yelling at their bars, the mouse zigging and zagging like Jim Thorpe heading for the endzone...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The mouse wins, zipping to safety under the restraint room door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy pounds his fist against the door in frustration:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PERCY
{DIALOGUE}: FUCK!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He fumbles with his keys, unlocks the door, yelling all the while:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PERCY
{DIALOGUE}: I'M GONNA RIP YOUR DISEASED HEAD OFF, YOU LITTLE PIECE OF SHIT!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: OUTSIDE E BLOCK

{DIALOGUE}: Boss Edgecomb?
{DIALOGUE}: Needs ta see you down here, boss.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The prison truck appears, swaying along the rutted road...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: IN THE TRUCK

{DIALOGUE}: Careful.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: OUTSIDE E BLOCK
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Billy is brought to the door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dean pulls his keys, starts to unlock it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We PUSH IN on Billy's face, where the tiniest trace of a smile is starting to grow...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INSIDE E BLOCK
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and Coffey's unease grows with it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: he presses his face to the bars, his whispering becoming more urgent:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY
{DIALOGUE}: Careful.
{DIALOGUE}: Careful.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul hears him, glances back with a puzzled look.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey's gaze is directed at the door, which is being unlocked...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE DOOR
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and opened.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In that moment, the slack look on Billy's face gives way to a wild grin.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A CRAZED SCREECH leaps from his throat, a cross between a rebel yell and a dog being tortured, freezing everybody's blood in their veins--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BILLY
{DIALOGUE}: Yeeeeeeehaaaawwwwwwrooooo!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: --and he drops his wrist-chain down over Dean's head, jerks it tight, begins to strangle him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dean lurches forward, Billy riding/propelling him through the door onto the Mile.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy stands frozen in the doorway, stunned.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Harry shoves him aside and jumps on Billy from behind, trying to get him off Dean.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul rushes from the cell to join the fray.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Billy whirls, delivering a stunning kick to Paul's groin.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul's bladder pain goes nuclear--he falls back in agony, clutching himself and sucking air through his teeth, unable even to scream.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Billy rams an elbow into Harry's face, knocks him sprawling on the desk, screaming and laughing and howling all the while:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BILLY
{DIALOGUE}: WHOOOEE, BOYS!
{DIALOGUE}: AIN'T THIS A PARTY, NOW?
{DIALOGUE}: IS IT, OR WHAT?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul forces himself to his feet, pulls his revolver, draws down on Billy...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: LET HIM GO!

{CHARACTER_NAME}: BILLY
{DIALOGUE}: C'MON, PERCY, HIT ME!
{DIALOGUE}: HIT ME, YOU LIMP NOODLE, HIT ME!

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: --it's Brutal coming through the door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He swings the baton and lands an awesome blow to Billy's head--THUMP!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The force of it spins Billy off his feet and slams him flat on his back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dean crawls away, gulping ragged breaths of air.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Amazingly, Billy's still conscious--he looks up at Brutal and laughs:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BILLY
{DIALOGUE}: Big fucker.
{DIALOGUE}: Snuck up on me.
{DIALOGUE}: No fair.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Still laughing, he makes another grab at Dean.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brutal whacks him again, turning his lights out for good.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRY
{DIALOGUE}: We thought he was doped.
{META_DATA}: (to Percy)
{DIALOGUE}: Didn't we?
{DIALOGUE}: Didn't we all of us think he was doped?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy nods, still numb.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul is furious:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: You didn't ask?
{DIALOGUE}: I guess that's not a mistake you'll be need to make again anytime soon, is it?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Harry shakes his head miserably.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul grabs Billy by the feet.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Grab his arms!
{DIALOGUE}: You too, Percy!
{META_DATA}: (off Percy's hesitation)
{DIALOGUE}: Percy, goddamn it, get your feet out of cement and help us out here!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy finally unfreezes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The three of them hoist Billy up in a dead-lift, get him in his cell, toss him on the cot.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They step out, slam the door, lock it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul looks to Harry and Brutal.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Get Dean looked at right away, make sure he's all right.
{DIALOGUE}: Percy, you go make a report to the warden for me.
{DIALOGUE}: Start off by saying the situation is under control-- it's not a story, he won't appreciate you drawing out the suspense.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL
{DIALOGUE}: What about you?
{DIALOGUE}: You look about ready to collapse.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: I've got the Mile till you all get back.
{DIALOGUE}: Go on now.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They all exit.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As soon as he's alone, Paul gives in to the pain, holding his crotch and sinking to his knees with a moan.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's so bad he actually lays down on the Mile, face pressed against the cool linoleum, wishing he were dead.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A stretch of silence...and then:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: Boss?
{DIALOGUE}: Needs ta see ya down here.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: This is not a good time, John Coffey.
{DIALOGUE}: Not a good time at all.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: But I needs ta see ya, boss.
{DIALOGUE}: I needs ta talk t'ya.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul sighs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Things couldn't get much worse than this.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He rises with a supreme effort, walks painfully down the Mile...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: COFFEY'S CELL
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and finds Coffey waiting at his bars.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY
{DIALOGUE}: Closer.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: I'm alone here right now, John.
{DIALOGUE}: Figure this is close enough.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY
{DIALOGUE}: Boss, please.
{DIALOGUE}: I got to whisper in your ear.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul blinks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Maybe it's the fever clouding his brain, or maybe...hell, is this what being hypnotized is like?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He tries to shake the sensation off, comes a little closer.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEL
{DIALOGUE}: Boss?
{DIALOGUE}: You know you not s'pose to do dat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Mind your business, Del.
{DIALOGUE}: What do you want, John Coffey?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY
{DIALOGUE}: Just to help.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His hand shoots out, grabs Paul by the collar, jerks him close.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul makes a panic-grab for his revolver...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...but Coffey lays his free hand atop Paul's, eases his grip from the gun--no need for that.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey's hand then drifts slowly down, easing to Paul's crotch...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{META_DATA}: (stunned, frozen)
{DIALOGUE}: What are you...doing?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and something goes WHUMP through Paul's body.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He arches back with his mouth agape and arms outstretched as a rush of energy seems to pass from Paul through Coffey's hand...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and then it's over.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul comes back to the real world, weak against the bars, realizes Del is hollering in his cell:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEL
{DIALOGUE}: HELP!
{DIALOGUE}: JOHN COFFEY'S KILLING BOSS EDGECOMB!
{DIALOGUE}: HELP!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Del, Chrissake, settle down, I'm fine...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It dawns on him that he really is fine.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Fever's gone.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: So is the pain in his groin.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John Coffey, though, seems to be having trouble.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He sits down on his bunk, bends forward, gagging like a man with a chicken bone caught in his throat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: John?
{DIALOGUE}: John, what's wrong?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul fumbles his keys to the lock, unsure if he should open the door, watching the big man's contortions grow stronger like a cat trying to cough up a hairball...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and then comes an unpleasant, gagging/retching sound as Coffey's lips draw back from his teeth in a kind of godawful sneer...and he exhales a cloud of what look like tiny black insects.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They swirl furiously in front of his face, turn white...and disappear.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul just stares, stunned.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Softly:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: What did you do, big boy?
{DIALOGUE}: What did you do to me?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY
{DIALOGUE}: I helped it.
{DIALOGUE}: Didn't I help it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, but...how?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey shrugs--it's something that just is.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY
{DIALOGUE}: Just took it back, is all.
{DIALOGUE}: Awful tired now, boss.
{DIALOGUE}: Dog tired.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He rolls onto his bunk, faces the wall.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul just stares at him, stunned.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns and walks up the Mile, his stiffness and pain now gone.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Del watches him go by, also stunned:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEL
{DIALOGUE}: What dat man do to you?
{DIALOGUE}: He throw some gris-gris on you?
{META_DATA}: (off Paul's look)
{DIALOGUE}: You look diff'int!
{DIALOGUE}: Even walk diff'int.
{DIALOGUE}: Like y'all better!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: You're imagining thing.
{DIALOGUE}: Lie down, Del.
{DIALOGUE}: Get you some rest.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul continues up the Mile...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: E BLOCK TOILET
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and steps back into the toilet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Not trusting this situation for even a moment, Paul opens his fly, takes a deep breath to prepare himself for the pain, starts to pee...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and we hear a healthy stream of water hitting the bowl.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The look on Paul's face says it all--blessed relief.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - DUSK
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul comes home from work, still looking numb about the whole thing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He drifts to the kitchen door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jan's at the counter, slicing vegetables for dinner.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She glances at him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JAN
{DIALOGUE}: Hi, honey.
{DIALOGUE}: How are you feeling?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Um...not too bad.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She turns back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul's eyes drift down to admire her ass.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JAN
{DIALOGUE}: What did the doctor say?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: No response.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's too busy staring.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She turns again--he glances hastily up.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, you know doctors.
{DIALOGUE}: Gobble-de- gook mostly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She turns back, keeps working.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He crosses the room, eyeing her ass all the way...and surprised her by pressing up against her from behind, running his hands along her hips.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JAN
{DIALOGUE}: Paul?
{DIALOGUE}: What are you doing?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He starts laying kisses on the back of her neck, giving her pleasant shivers, murmuring:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: What's it feel like?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JAN
{DIALOGUE}: I know what it feels like...it feels great...but...Paul...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's getting her breathless.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She turns into his arms and they get into some passionate kissing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's not too long before they're frantically peeling each other's clothes off...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and we find them having a wild tumble in the sheets, both moaning and groaning, sweating and panting.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She pushes him flat on the bed, pauses to catch her breath...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JAN
{DIALOGUE}: Those must've been some pills.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and they keep going, rutting like crazed weasels...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...as their moans go drifting into the night...
{META_DATA}: FADE TO:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SAME ANGLE AS ABOVE - DAWN
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and they're still moaning up there as the sun creeps up.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jan falls back, exhausted after the latest go-round.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She catches her breath, looks over at Paul, and finally:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JAN
{DIALOGUE}: Paul?
{DIALOGUE}: Not that I'm complaining.
{DIALOGUE}: But we haven't gone four times in one night since we were nineteen.
{META_DATA}: (off his look)
{DIALOGUE}: You wanna tell me just what the hell's going on?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Well...thing is...I never actually got to the doctor yesterday...

{DIALOGUE}: That's swell.
{DIALOGUE}: Thanks.
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, I'm sure I'll feel better.
{DIALOGUE}: Okay.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He hangs up, turns to Jan.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JAN

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The screen door opens and CYNTHIA HAMMERSMITH ushers Paul out.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CYNTHIA
{DIALOGUE}: I offer you a cold drink?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, ma'am, a cold drink would be fine.
{DIALOGUE}: Thank you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She goes back inside.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Burt rises.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Mr. Hammersmith.
{DIALOGUE}: Your office said I'd find you at home today.
{DIALOGUE}: I hope I'm not troubling you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURT
{DIALOGUE}: That depends, Mr.--?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Paul Edgecomb.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm the E Block superintendant at Cold Mountain.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURT
{DIALOGUE}: The Green Mile.
{DIALOGUE}: I've heard of it.
{DIALOGUE}: Lost a few clients your way.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: That's why I'm here.
{DIALOGUE}: I'd like to ask you about one of them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Burt settles back down, motions "please sit".
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURT
{DIALOGUE}: Which client?
{DIALOGUE}: Now you got my curiosity aroused.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: John Coffey.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURT
{DIALOGUE}: Ah, Coffey.
{DIALOGUE}: He causing you problems?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: No, can't say he is.
{DIALOGUE}: He doesn't like the dark.
{DIALOGUE}: He cries on occasion.
{DIALOGUE}: Other than that...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURT
{DIALOGUE}: Cries, does he?
{DIALOGUE}: Well, he's got a lot to cry about, I'd say.
{DIALOGUE}: You know what he did.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{META_DATA}: (nods)
{DIALOGUE}: I read the court transcripts.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cynthia reappears, hands Paul a cold root beer.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Thank you, Missus.

{DIALOGUE}: Y'all come on up!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She goes back inside, but the kids aren't quite able to tear themselves away from their play.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURT
{DIALOGUE}: What exactly are you trying to find out?
{DIALOGUE}: Satisfy my curiosity, I'll see if I can satisfy yours.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: I've wondered if he ever did anything like that before.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURT
{DIALOGUE}: Why?
{DIALOGUE}: Has he said anything?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: But a man who does a thing like that has often developed a taste for it over time.
{DIALOGUE}: Occurred to me it might be easy enough to follow his backtrail and find out.
{DIALOGUE}: A man his size, and colored to boot, can't be that hard to trace.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURT
{DIALOGUE}: You'd think so, but you'd be wrong.
{DIALOGUE}: Believe me, we tried.
{DIALOGUE}: It's like he dropped out of the sky.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: How do you explain that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURT
{DIALOGUE}: We're in a Depression.
{DIALOGUE}: A third of the country's out of work.
{DIALOGUE}: People are drifting by the thousands, looking for work, looking for that greener grass.
{DIALOGUE}: Even a giant like Coffey wouldn't get noticed everywhere he goes... not until he kills a couple of little girls.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: He's...strange, I admit.
{DIALOGUE}: But there doesn't seem to be any real violence in him.
{DIALOGUE}: I know violent men, Mr. Hammersmith.
{DIALOGUE}: I deal with 'em day in and day out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Burt smiles, realizing:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURT
{DIALOGUE}: You didn't come up here to ask me whether he might have killed before.
{DIALOGUE}: You came up here to see if I think he did it at all.
{DIALOGUE}: That's it, isn't it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Do you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURT
{DIALOGUE}: One seldom sees a less ambiguous case.
{DIALOGUE}: He was found with the victims in his arms.
{DIALOGUE}: Blurted out a confession right then and there.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Yet you defended him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURT
{DIALOGUE}: Everyone is entitled to a defense.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cynthia hollers from an open window:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CYNTHIA
{DIALOGUE}: Kids!
{DIALOGUE}: Lunch!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURT
{DIALOGUE}: Y'all listen to your Momma, now!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The kids start this way.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Burt turns back to Paul.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURT
{DIALOGUE}: Tell you something.
{DIALOGUE}: You listen close, too, because it might be something you need to know.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: I'm listening.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURT
{DIALOGUE}: We had us a dog.
{DIALOGUE}: No particular breed, but gentle.
{DIALOGUE}: Ready to lick your hand or fetch a stick.
{DIALOGUE}: Just a sweet mongrel, you know the kind.
{META_DATA}: (Paul nods)
{DIALOGUE}: In many way, a good mongrel dog is like you negro.
{DIALOGUE}: You get to know it, and often you get to love it.
{DIALOGUE}: It is of no particular use, but you keep it around because you think it loves you.
{DIALOGUE}: If you're lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you never have to find out any different.
{DIALOGUE}: My wife and I were not so lucky.
{DIALOGUE}: Caleb.
{DIALOGUE}: Come here for a second.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The little boy comes to him, staring at his feet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Burt tires to raise the boy's chin.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The boy resists for a moment...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURT
{DIALOGUE}: Please, son.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and then his face comes around.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's horribly scarred on that side, the eye missing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURT
{DIALOGUE}: He has the one eye.
{DIALOGUE}: I suppose he's lucky not to be blind.
{DIALOGUE}: We get down on our knees and thank God for that much at least.
{DIALOGUE}: Right Caleb?
{META_DATA}: (the boy nods shyly)
{DIALOGUE}: Okay, go on in now.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The boy races inside after his sister.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul follows Burt's gaze off toward the rear of the property, where an unoccupied doghouse stands weathered and sad in the weeds.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURT
{DIALOGUE}: That dog attacked my boy for no reason.
{DIALOGUE}: Just got it into his mind one day.
{DIALOGUE}: Same with John Coffey.
{DIALOGUE}: He was sorry afterwards, of that I have no doubt...but those little girls stayed raped and murdered nonetheless.
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe he's never done it before--my dog never bit before, but I didn't concern myself with that.
{DIALOGUE}: I went out there with my rifle and grabbed his collar and blew his brains out.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: I'm sorry for your trouble.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Burt acknowledges the condolence with a gracious nod.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURT
{DIALOGUE}: I'm as enlightened as the next man, Mr. Edgecomb.
{DIALOGUE}: I would not bring back slavery for all the tea in China.
{DIALOGUE}: I believe we have to be humane and generous in our efforts to solve the race problem.
{DIALOGUE}: But we have to remember that the negro will bite if he gets the chance, just like a mongrel dog will bite if it crosses its mind to do so.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Is Coffey guilty?
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, he is.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't you doubt it, and don't you turn your back on him.
{DIALOGUE}: You might get away with it once or even a hundred times...but in the end...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He raises his hand, making biting motions with his fingers.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURT
{DIALOGUE}: You understand?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul says nothing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Burt gazes out again.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Softly:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURT
{DIALOGUE}: I'm gonna have to tear that old doghouse down one of these days.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. PAUL'S MODEL T - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul drives back to Cold Mountain, his heart conflicted...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. E BLOCK - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and he walks onto the Mile with a bundle wrapped in a dish towel.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brutal glances up from the desk, sniffing the air.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: No, it's not for you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul continues down the Mile.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Whatever he's carrying, the smell of it brings Del to his bars.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul and Brutal nod--and are stunned as:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PERCY
{DIALOGUE}: No such place.
{DIALOGUE}: That's just a fairy tale these guys told you to keep you quiet.
{DIALOGUE}: Just thought you should know, faggot.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The stricken look in Del's eyes tells us a part of him had known all along.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Nothing they can do.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: TIGHT ON PAUL
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as realization starts to dawn.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stares at the bucket, then across the floor to Delacroix, coming to terms with the evidence of his eyes--there's no water on the floor or dripping down the sides of Del's neck.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul's eyes widen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A stunned beat of horror.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He starts to open his mouth to scream "NO!"
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: , but Percy beats him to it with:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PERCY
{DIALOGUE}: Roll on two.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Delacroix begins twisting and jittering in the chair, his masked face snapping violently from side to side, his legs pistoning up and down in his restraints.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Smoke starts coming through the fabric of the mask, puffing upward.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Del is being cooked alive.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul spins to the partition, hollering--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL

{DIALOGUE}: Don't you do it.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The other guards are trading wild looks, unable to believe what's happening.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Even Percy looks aghast--he was expecting something, but not this.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Del begins SCREAMING--the wild, hysterical sound of an animal being shredded alive in a hay baler.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The HUMMING goes uneven and ragged, the lights rising and falling...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ON THE MILE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...as Del's screams rise and fall with them, echoing up the corridor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey's shaking and screaming too, as if feeling Del's pain.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mr. Jingles squirms out of his grasp and goes squeaking in terror toward the restraint room door...

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Witnesses start rising to their feet:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WITNESSES

{DIALOGUE}: NO!
{DIALOGUE}: ROLL, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, ROLL!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Harry scoops up the bucket of water to throw it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: No water!
{DIALOGUE}: No water!
{DIALOGUE}: You crazy?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Harry backs off with a look of dazed understanding--you don't throw water on a man getting juiced.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Right.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He drops the bucket, races to get the chemical fire extinguisher instead.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The flaming mask peels away, revealing Del's charring face.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His eyeballs are misshapen globs of burning white jelly blown out of their sockets.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The ATTENDING DOCTOR faints dead away.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Pandemonium now in the room.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hal grabs Paul by the shoulder, spins him around.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAL

{DIALOGUE}: He's still alive!
{DIALOGUE}: You want me to shut down while he's still alive?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hal is horrified at the thought.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Del is jittering and screaming, rocking from side to side, smoke pouring from his nostrils and mouth, his tongue sizzling purple-black.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hal is near the back, calming the crowd:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAL
{DIALOGUE}: It's all right, folks, it's all under control.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL

{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Delacroix's dead, nothing can change that, and Percy's not worth it!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL
{DIALOGUE}: So he just gets away with it?
{DIALOGUE}: Is that how it works?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hal comes lunging down the stairs, furious:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAL
{DIALOGUE}: What the fuck was that?
{DIALOGUE}: Jesus Christ, three witnesses puked all over the floor up there!
{DIALOGUE}: And the smell!
{DIALOGUE}: I got Van Hay to open both doors, but that smell won't come out for five damn years, that's what I'm betting!

{DIALOGUE}: I can hear him!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{META_DATA}: (quietly)
{DIALOGUE}: Can he carry a tune, Hal?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This pulls the plug on the moment--Hal snorts, triggering laughter among the men, a wild release of tension and fear.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everybody starts feeling a bit saner again as it dies down:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAL
{DIALOGUE}: Okay, boys.
{DIALOGUE}: Okay.
{DIALOGUE}: Now what the hell happened?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All eyes go to Percy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hal turns, sees Percy's bloody lip.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAL
{DIALOGUE}: Percy?
{DIALOGUE}: Something to say?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PERCY
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't know the sponge was supposed to be wet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A look of utter contempt from Hal.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAL
{DIALOGUE}: How many years you spend pissing on the toilet seat before somebody told you to put it up?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Percy fucked up, Hal.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAL
{DIALOGUE}: Is that your official position?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAL

{DIALOGUE}: He did it to me too.
{DIALOGUE}: He put his hands on me and took my bladder infection away.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL
{DIALOGUE}: If you say it, I accept it.
{DIALOGUE}: But what's it got to do with us?

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul nods--that's who we're talking about.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JAN
{DIALOGUE}: You really think you can help her?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: It's not a bladder infection, or even a busted-up mouse.
{DIALOGUE}: But there might be a chance.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRY
{DIALOGUE}: Hold on now.
{DIALOGUE}: You're talking about our jobs.
{DIALOGUE}: Sneak a sick woman onto a cellblock?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Hal would never allow that.
{DIALOGUE}: You know him, he wouldn't believe something unless it fell on him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL
{DIALOGUE}: So you're talking about taking John Coffey to her.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: What's happening to her is an offense, Brutal.
{DIALOGUE}: To the eyes and the ears and the heart.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL
{DIALOGUE}: I have no doubt.
{DIALOGUE}: But we don't know her like you and Jan do...do we?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: That's why it's a lot to ask.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRY
{DIALOGUE}: It is.
{DIALOGUE}: Let's not forget Coffey's a murderer.
{DIALOGUE}: What if he escapes?
{DIALOGUE}: I'd hate losing my job or going to prison, but I'd hate having a dead child on my conscience even more.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL

{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul and Brutal walk to the front door as the lights inside the house keep clicking on.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The last one finally comes on over the stoop, the front door opens a crack...and the twin barrels of a shotgun poke out into the night.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAL
{DIALOGUE}: Who the hell goes there at two- thirty in the goddamn morning?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Hal, it's us!
{DIALOGUE}: It's Paul and Brutal--it's us!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The door swings wider, revealing Hal's face gaunt and haggard in the yellow porch light, stunned to see them:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAL
{DIALOGUE}: Paul, what are you doing here at this hour?
{DIALOGUE}: Jesus, it's not a lockdown, is it?
{DIALOGUE}: Or a riot?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Hal, God's sakes, take your finger off the trigger...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hal doesn't, aiming past them at the truck in the yard.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAL
{DIALOGUE}: Are you hostages?

{DIALOGUE}: Hal?
{DIALOGUE}: Who are you talking to, you fucking cocksucker?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A frozen moment.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hal mortified.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: No one's hurt.
{DIALOGUE}: We're here to help.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAL
{DIALOGUE}: Help what?
{DIALOGUE}: I don't understand.
{DIALOGUE}: Is this a prison break?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: I can't explain what it is.
{DIALOGUE}: You just have to trust me.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey comes up the steps, brushes Paul aside, stops before the warden.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAL
{DIALOGUE}: What do you...want?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MELINDA
{DIALOGUE}: Hal!

{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAL
{DIALOGUE}: Don't you go up there!
{DIALOGUE}: Don't you do it!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY
{DIALOGUE}: Boss, you just be quiet now and let me be.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey mounts the stairs with the others at his heels, heading up toward that quavering voice:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MELINDA (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: Stay out of here!
{DIALOGUE}: Whoever you are, just stay out!
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not dressed for visitors, you rat's asshole!
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey enters, trailed by the others.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul pauses, horrified.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The woman propped in bed barely resembles Melinda Moores anymore--she looks made up like a Halloween witch, her livid skin hanging in a loose trail of wrinkles, one corner of her mouth twisted.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Yellowish bile stains her chin and the front of her nightgown.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her hair has gone white and straw-like, her eyes glowering at Coffey with lively, irrational interest:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MELINDA
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, so big!
{DIALOGUE}: Pull down your pants!
{DIALOGUE}: Let's have a look!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hal groans with despair.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey just stands there for a moment, watching her from a distance, then approaches the bed...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MELINDA
{DIALOGUE}: Don't come near me, pigfucker.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...but as he draws closer, a change occurs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her features soften, her eyes become more sane and aware.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MELINDA
{DIALOGUE}: Why do you have so many scars?
{DIALOGUE}: Who hurt you so badly?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY
{DIALOGUE}: Don't hardly remember, ma'am.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey sits on the edge of the bed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The lights seem to flare hotter and brighter.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Tears are forming in Melinda's eyes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MELINDA
{DIALOGUE}: What's your name?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY
{DIALOGUE}: John Coffey, ma'am.
{DIALOGUE}: Like the drink, only not spelt the same.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She lays back, staring at him with shining fascination.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The world seems to be slowing down, growing very still indeed...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and he starts bending slowly toward her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY
{DIALOGUE}: Ma'am?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MELINDA
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, John Coffey?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY
{DIALOGUE}: I see it.
{DIALOGUE}: I see it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He comes closer...closer still...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY
{DIALOGUE}: You be still now.
{DIALOGUE}: You be so quiet and so still.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He brushes her forehead with his lips...the gentlest whisper of a kiss...then moves his mouth down to hers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For a moment we can see one of her eyes staring past him, filling with an expression of surprise...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and then her face is lost to view as Coffey puts his lips on hers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We hear a soft whistling sound as he begins inhaling the air deeply from her lungs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Something hot and glowing starts passing between them, drawn on his breath...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The men watch.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The house seems to shudder in that moment, as if the entire world has shifted an inch to the right...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: DOWNSTAIRS PARLOR
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and the grandfather clock stops ticking, the pendulum stopping dead, the glass face cracking neatly up the center...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: BEDROOM
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and a windowpane cracks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then another.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A picture falls off the wall.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A lightbulb bursts, showering glass.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul smells smoke, realizes the fringed coverlet of the bed has caught fire.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Moving like a man in a dream, he reaches for the waterglass on the nightstand, douses the flames.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey keeps kissing Melinda in that deep and mysterious way, inhaling and inhaling, her hand held in his like a tiny white bird.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For a moment we actually hear something screaming, as if some willful imp were being extracted by force...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and then it's over.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey raises his head, revealing:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Melinda's beautiful face.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her mouth no longer droops.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Color is coming back to her hair.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy blinks, unable to grasp that.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: We know people, too, are you so foolish you don't realize that?

{DIALOGUE}: Sooner or later.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul nods with weary resignation--yeah, I know.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ON THE MILE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy pauses near Coffey's cell, careless as always, getting his holster buckled--and a massive black arm grabs him through the bars.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His SCREAM brings Paul and the others from the restraint room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey's face is pressed so tight between his bars it looks like he's trying to push his head through.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He draws his lips back, baring his teeth in an awful sneer...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy whacks him with his baton.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coffey barely seems to feel it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He curls his free hand around the back of Percy's head, pulling him ever closer...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and Percy's screams are muffled as their mouths come together.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Several lightbulbs explode in their steel cages up and down the Mile.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy's baton drops from his nerveless fingers and clatters to the floor, never to be picked up again.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then Coffey steps back, rubbing his mouth as if he's tasted something bad.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The color has returned to his skin.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy, however, is ashen gray.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His expression is blank as a sheet of paper, not a trace of awareness in his eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The men are stunned.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul raises his hand to Percy's face, snaps his fingers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Nothing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He tries again, clapping loudly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy reacts slightly, eyes fluttering, swaying a bit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Easy, easy.
{DIALOGUE}: You all right?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy says nothing.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He comes to a swaying stop at Wild Bill's cell...and turns slowly to look in.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wild Bill is coming painfully around, groggily clutching his head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks up, see Percy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BILLY
{DIALOGUE}: What'a you looking at, you limp noodle?
{DIALOGUE}: You wanna kiss my ass or suck my dick?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Nothing for the longest moment.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy just staring...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...and then he pulls his gun and empties it into Wild Bill as fast as he can pull the trigger.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bill takes all six rounds in the chest, reeling back across the cell.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He hits the wall and slides down, leaving a smear, his face registering a final look of stunned surprise.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul and the other tackle Percy and bring him down, wrestling the gun out of his hand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dean is almost weeping:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEAN
{DIALOGUE}: Oh God, oh God, no...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Percy is flat on his back, staring up at nothing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The black "bugs" come drifting out of nose and mouth, swirling in the air over his head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They turn white and disappear.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The men are speechless.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul turns, sees Coffey sitting on the floor at his bars, watching.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY
{DIALOGUE}: Punished them bad men.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY
{DIALOGUE}: Take my hand, boss.
{DIALOGUE}: You see for yourself.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL
{DIALOGUE}: Paul, no!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul hesitates, torn between reason and Coffey's pleading eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A whisper:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY
{DIALOGUE}: My hand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul can't help it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He has to.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Their hands come together.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul lurches wildly as that circuit starts blazing between them...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: No...please...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COFFEY
{DIALOGUE}: Gots to, boss.
{DIALOGUE}: Gots to give you a little bit of myself.
{DIALOGUE}: A gift, like.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kathe skipping to the head of the hopscotch squares, turning and starting back, laughing in the sun...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The paint brush slopping more paint, dripping like blood...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul jerks and twists, trying to pull away, trying to break the circuit, but he can't, not till all is seen and done:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Marjorie Detterick calling from the porch for everybody to come eat, supper's ready...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A hammer pausing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Klaus looking down from atop the barn...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Detterick twins finishing their hopscotch, gathering their jump ropes from the dust, running across the yard...

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The little girls running past the man with the paint brush, who turns and smile as they go by...it's Wild Bill.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The basket of biscuits is passed one last time.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A hand pulls one out, raises it for a bite.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's Wild Bill, smiling at the little girls as conversation flows around the table...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul screams, trying to pull away, but:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The porch door is kicked off its hinges just before dawn, a figure looming in the doorway.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kathe wakes, her scream cut short as the man's fist punches her hard in the face...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul trembles violently as if riding the lightning himself, pleading for it to stop, but there's one last thing:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wild Bill looms over the terrified little girls like a horrendous boogeyman, whispers to Kathe:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BILLY
{DIALOGUE}: You lover your sister?
{DIALOGUE}: You make any noise, know what happens?
{DIALOGUE}: I'll kill her instead of you.
{META_DATA}: (to Cora)
{DIALOGUE}: And if you make any noise, I'll kill her.

{DIALOGUE}: Cheap labor, just another drifter...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL
{DIALOGUE}: Only not.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Sick bastard came back a month later, just before dawn.

{META_DATA}: (absorbs this)
{DIALOGUE}: Then you can stop it.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JAN
{DIALOGUE}: Show this farmer--what's his name, Detterick?
{DIALOGUE}: --show him a picture of Wild Bill.
{META_DATA}: (off their looks)
{DIALOGUE}: Why not?
{DIALOGUE}: If Wharton was there...if the farmer can identify his picture and they know he was there...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL
{DIALOGUE}: Him being there in May doesn't mean he came back and killed those girls in June.
{DIALOGUE}: Even if he was committing other crimes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL

{DIALOGUE}: Hell, Coffey's own lawyer would come throw the switch if we let him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JAN
{DIALOGUE}: Then lie.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Lie?
{DIALOGUE}: About what?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JAN

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JAN
{DIALOGUE}: But he was there!
{DIALOGUE}: He painted their barn!
{DIALOGUE}: He ate dinner with them!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: All the more reason he might take credit for the crime.
{DIALOGUE}: He's gonna fry anyway, so why not boast?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jan stands thinking for a moment, then:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JAN
{DIALOGUE}: All right.
{DIALOGUE}: Then you've got to get John Coffey out on your own.

{DIALOGUE}: Ma'am?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JAN

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JAN
{DIALOGUE}: Work out a plan.
{DIALOGUE}: Make it look like a real escape.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRY
{DIALOGUE}: Better be a plan an imbecile could dream up.
{DIALOGUE}: Nobody'd believe it otherwise.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRUTAL
{DIALOGUE}: Even if we did think of something, it wouldn't do any good.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JAN
{DIALOGUE}: Why not?
{DIALOGUE}: Just why the hell not?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: Because he's a six-foot-eight-inch baldheaded black man with barely enough brains to feed himself.
{DIALOGUE}: How long you think it'd be before he was recaptured?
{DIALOGUE}: Two hours?
{DIALOGUE}: Six?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jan swipes a tear away with the heel of her hand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Softly:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JAN
{DIALOGUE}: Do you mean to kill him, you cowards?
{DIALOGUE}: Do you?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paul tries to take her hand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She wrenches away, furious.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JAN
{DIALOGUE}: Don't touch me!

{DIALOGUE}: Does he have the influence to do something about this?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PAUL
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JAN
