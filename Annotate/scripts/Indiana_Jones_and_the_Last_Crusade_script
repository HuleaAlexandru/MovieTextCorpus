{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The men are ROUGH RIDER (his name describes his dress), ROSCOE (a Bowery Boy bully of 14) and HALFBREED (with straight black hair that cascades over his shoulders).
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And the fourth man wears a LEATHER WAIST JACKET and BROWN FELT FEDORA HAT.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He has his back turned to us, but we would be willing to bet anything that this is INDLANA JONES.

{DIALOGUE}: Run back and find the others.
{DIALOGUE}: Tell Mister Havelock that there are men looting in the caves.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: ROSCOE
{DIALOGUE}: He's got our thing!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HALFBREED
{DIALOGUE}: Get 'im!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The three Robbers are so eager to get their hands on INDY, they almost knock each other over in the attempt.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The impact sends a shock wave up his body that rattles his back teeth.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Indy stands up and successfully mounts his horse.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: FEDORA AND HIS MEN ARRIVE at the roof's edge in time to see INDY climb into the saddle and gallop off.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The passenger in the car.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His face is concealed by the hat's wide brim.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: PANAMA HAT
{DIALOGUE}: Come on.
{DIALOGUE}: Get him!

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INDY crawls away, toward an opening on the opposite side.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: HALFBREED grabs at Indy's feet again; Indy rolls away and we SEE large bins of squirming snakes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The combined weight of the three people is more than the catwalk was intended for, and the BOLTS BEGIN TO RIP FROM THE CEILING.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everyone holds their breath, afraid to make another move.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Too late.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SEVERAL BOLTS TEAR FREE.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER SCREAM... but it's Indy's end of the catwalk that DROPS DOWN... PLUNGING INDY to the floor of the car.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He lands hard, with a SPLASH into a vat of water... where he finds himself eye- to-eye with an—
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ENORMOUS ANACONDA
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The head of this snake is so damn big, it looks more like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: INDY
{DIALOGUE}: Oh... Oh...

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: IN THE BOXCAR BELOW
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ... THE FEROCIOUS BLACK RHINO is becoming extremely agitated by the commotion going on atop his cage.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Finally, he raises his head and THRUSTS HIS HORN THROUGH THE ROOF.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: BACK TO THE ROOFTOP
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as the horn SMASHES through the wood only inches from INDY's head.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INDY gets to his feet—looks ahead—sees a WATER TANK alongside the track directly up ahead.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Indy gets an idea...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In an instant, he calculates his approach—times the distance—and LEAPS for the tank's WATER SPOUT.
{META_DATA}: CONTINUED:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He catches it perfectly... but his velocity causes the water spout to ROTATE A FULL 360 DEGREES.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With INDY hanging on, feet kicking, the water spout deposits him back on the train, onto the ROOF OF A STOCKCAR, where he looks up to see FEDORA walking toward him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FEDORA
{DIALOGUE}: Come on, kid.
{DIALOGUE}: There's no way out of this.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As INDY edges away from FEDORA, a portion of the STOCKCAR'S ROOF COLLAPSES and Indy FALLS THROUGH into the car below.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INDY CRASHES down from above.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dust rises.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: INDY
{DIALOGUE}: Ohhh!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INDY's eyes take a moment to adjust to the dark.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A bit of sunlight leaks in through the cracks between the boards.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then INDY sees it.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Rising slowly to its feet... an AFRICAN LION.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Lion ROARS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The boxcar walls shake.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Indy gasps.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dust swirls up into the shafts of sunlight.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And INDY has one more surprise in store: The Cross of Cortes has been dislodged from his belt during the fall...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INDY glances around, sees a coiled LION TAMER'S WHIP hanging on a nail.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He carefully takes it down by the handle.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Lion sees this and GROWLS SOFTLY.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INDY swallows hard and gives the whip a try.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It unravels awkwardly, its TIP flying back and HITTING INDY IN THE FACE... CUTTING his chin.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Lion GROWLS LOUDER.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Indy quickly gathers up the whip, wets his lips, and tries again.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This time—success!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The WHIP CRACKS SHARPLY.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Lion BELLOWS and SWATS the air... and steps back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INDY looks amazed and delighted.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He CRACKS the whip again.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Lion backs away even more.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: rushes forward and calls to INDY.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRODY
{DIALOGUE}: Indy... Indy, you must hurry!!
{DIALOGUE}: Come quickly!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: BACK TO INDY
{CHARACTER_NAME}: INDY
{META_DATA}: (realizing)
{DIALOGUE}: It's... a leap of faith.
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, God.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: HENRY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: calls to his son.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HENRY
{DIALOGUE}: You must believe, boy.
{DIALOGUE}: you must... believe.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see him do it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see him leap into space.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see that he is in midair.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see that he is not going to make it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His hands claw for the opposite wall but he is going to fall 100 feet to his death.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then—he doesn't!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He appears to be held up by thin air as he lands on his hands and knees.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INDY looks around and down and now he figures it out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ingeniously, the First Crusaders have painted a pathway to align with the rocks 100 feet below.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is a perfect forced perspective image of the rocks below with lines from a hundred feet continuing six feet below his sight line where his feet are stepping.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's painted to blend in with the rocks below.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Highly evolved camouflage... in perfect alignment with everything we see below.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When INDY leans out to the left or right... that's when he sees the perfect alignment shift that betrays the trick.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Indy throws some dirt on the bridge and he crosses it like the first Crusader from the painting over Henry's desk.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Indy crawls through a small opening in the side of the cliff and enters a Temple.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A vast array of chalices is displayed on the altar of this small Temple.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Perhaps a hundred or more.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Many sizes, many shapes, some gold, some silver, but they all glitter and shine.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INDY is mesmerized by their number and their beauty.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then he realizes that a man is praying at the altarl
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He has his back turned to INDY... but he is dressed as what he is!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A GRAIL KNIGHT.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLOSE ON THE GRAIL KNIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But we can't see the Grail Knight's face.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The visor of his helmet is down.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Perhaps we see his eyes.
{META_DATA}: CONTINUED:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When the GRAIL KNIGHT sees INDY he gets wearily to his feet and, surprisingly, prepares to give combat...taking up his two-handed broadsword...he comes at Indy, attempting to swing the huge, heavy sword but finding the effort almost too much.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Indy dodges two or three clumsy swings of the sword, making no attempt to fight back...until the Knight, exhausted, drops the sword and collapses.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Indy approaches him and raises the visor and we see that the Knight is a very ancient man.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KNIGHT
{DIALOGUE}: I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: INDY
{DIALOGUE}: Who are you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KNIGHT
{DIALOGUE}: The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: INDY
{DIALOGUE}: That was seven hundred years ago.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KNIGHT
{DIALOGUE}: A long time to wait.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The GRAIL KNIGHT reaches forward and fingers Indy's clothing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KNIGHT
{DIALOGUE}: You're strangely dressed...for a knight.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: INDY
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not exactly...a knight.
{DIALOGUE}: What do you mean?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KNIGHT
{DIALOGUE}: I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy.
{DIALOGUE}: The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat.
{DIALOGUE}: I pass it to you who vanquished me.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The GRAIL KNIGHT holds his sword out to INDY.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: INDY
{META_DATA}: (gulp)
{DIALOGUE}: Listen, I don't have time to explain, but—
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At that moment DONOVAN and ELSA appear.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Donovan turns to face the display of cups.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DONOVAN
{DIALOGUE}: Which one is it?
{META_DATA}: CONTINUED: (2)
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KNIGHT
{DIALOGUE}: You must choose.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: But choose wisely.
{DIALOGUE}: For as the True Grail will bring you life— the False Grail will take it from you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DONOVAN
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not a historian.
{DIALOGUE}: I have no idea what it looks like.
{DIALOGUE}: Which one is it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ELSA
{DIALOGUE}: Let me choose.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DONOVAN
{DIALOGUE}: Thank you, Doctor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ELSA and INDY exchange looks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He thinks he is seeing her in her true colors.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ELSA chooses a cup—a solid gold, emerald encrusted goblet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: DONOVAN instantly takes it from her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DONOVAN
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, yes.
{DIALOGUE}: It's more beautiful than I'd ever imagined.
{DIALOGUE}: This certainly is the cup of the King of Kings.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: DONOVAN rushes to the well and fills the goblet with water.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DONOVAN
{DIALOGUE}: Eternal life!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: DONOVAN drinks from the goblet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, DONOVAN'S entire body starts to convulse.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His face contorts in agony.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He grabs his stomach and turns toward ELSA.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DONOVAN
{DIALOGUE}: What . . . is . . . happening. . . to . . . me. . .?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He starts to age—fast!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His hair grows long and gray and brittle.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His face sinks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Fingernails curl back on themselves.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Milky cataracts coat his eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ELSA gasps and screams.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DONOVAN
{DIALOGUE}: What. . . is . . . happening. . . ?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His skin turns brown and leathery and stretches across his bones until it splits.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His skeletal hands reach for ELSA's throat, choking her.
{META_DATA}: CONTINUED: (3)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INDY rushes forward and pushes DONOVAN away.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he falls he BODY BREAKS INTO FLAMES, then SHATTERS AGAINST THE WALL.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KNIGHT
{DIALOGUE}: He chose...poorly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INDY studies the array of chalices.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ELSA
{DIALOGUE}: It would not be made out of gold.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INDY picks up another cup—a simple earthenware jug.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: INDY
{DIALOGUE}: That's the cup of a carpenter.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He and ELSA exchange a look.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: INDY
{DIALOGUE}: There's only one way to find out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INDY goes to the well and fills the earthenware jug with water, then pauses.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INDY brings the jug to his lips and takes several large swallows.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A strange sensation overcomes him, a feeling of peace and contentment...and we see his wounds begin to heal.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KNIGHT
{DIALOGUE}: You have chosen wisely.
{DIALOGUE}: But the Grail cannot pass beyond the Great Seal.
{DIALOGUE}: That is the boundary and the price of immortality.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CUT TO BRODY AND SALLAH who attend to Henry awaiting Indy's return.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INDY and ELSA come forward with the Grail.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The TWO NAZI SOLDIERS are over-awed by the possessors of the Grail.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They put down their guns and kneel.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INDY kneels by HENRY's side and tilts his head forward and holds the Grail to his lips.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: HENRY is too weak to even open his eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: HENRY swallows some of the water.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Much of it runs down the corners of his mouth.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Finally INDY pours the water over the wound and everyone watches in astonishment as the wound and the blood stain disappear before their eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The color returns to Henry's face.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: HENRY's eyes open.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The first thing he sees is the Grail and they light up.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then they shift to INDY's face—and they light up even more...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: NAZI SOLDIERS
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: run forward.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SALLAH points a rifle at them.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SALLAH
{DIALOGUE}: Drop your guns.
{DIALOGUE}: Please.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: INDY
{DIALOGUE}: Elsa, don't cross the Seal.
{DIALOGUE}: The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A RUMBLING SOUND IS HEARD and the ground roars and shifts.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dirt falls from the ceiling of the cavern.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ELSA falls on the Great Seal.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Grail bounces away from her grasp.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She reaches for it and the ground beneath her begins to SPLIT OPEN.

{DIALOGUE}: Junior!

{DIALOGUE}: Give me your hand.
{DIALOGUE}: Give me your other hand!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ELSA just manages to touch the Grail.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In doing so, she has tipped the balance too far—INDY slides down another yard, Elsa loses her grip and falls screaming to her death.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: INDY
{META_DATA}: (horrified)
{DIALOGUE}: Elsa!!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now the ledge INDY lies upon begins to break apart.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: HENRY
