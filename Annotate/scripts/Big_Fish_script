{META_DATA}: "BIG FISH"
{META_DATA}: Written by
{META_DATA}: John August
{META_DATA}: Based on the novel by
{META_DATA}: Daniel Wallace
{META_DATA}: Final Production Draft
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is a Southern story, full of lies and fabrications, but truer for their inclusion.
{META_DATA}: FADE IN:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A RIVER.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We're underwater, watching a fat catfish swim along.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is The Beast.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: There are some fish that cannot be caught.
{DIALOGUE}: It's not that they're faster or stronger than other fish.
{DIALOGUE}: They're just touched by something extra.
{DIALOGUE}: Call it luck.
{DIALOGUE}: Call it grace.
{DIALOGUE}: One such fish was The Beast.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Beast's journey takes it past a dangling fish hook, baited with worms.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Past a tempting lure, sparkling in the sun.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Past a swiping bear claw.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Beast isn't worried.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: By the time I was born, he was already a legend.
{DIALOGUE}: He'd taken more hundred- dollar lures than any fish in Alabama.
{DIALOGUE}: Some said that fish was the ghost of Henry Walls, a thief who'd drowned in that river 60 years before.
{DIALOGUE}: Others claimed he was a lesser dinosaur, left over from the Cretaceous period.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (1973)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WILL BLOOM, AGE 3, listens wide-eyed as his father EDWARD BLOOM, 40's and handsome, tells the story.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In every gesture, Edward is bigger than life, describing each detail with absolute conviction.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't put any stock into such speculation or superstition.
{DIALOGUE}: All I knew was I'd been trying to catch that fish since I was a boy no bigger than you.
{META_DATA}: (closer)
{DIALOGUE}: And on the day you were born, that was the day I finally caught him.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT (1977)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A few years later, and Will sits with the other INDIAN GUIDES as Edward continues telling the story to the tribe.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Now, I'd tried everything on it: worms, lures, peanut butter, peanut butter-and-cheese.
{DIALOGUE}: But on that day I had a revelation: if that fish was the ghost of a thief, the usual bait wasn't going to work.
{DIALOGUE}: I would have to use something he truly desired.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward points to his wedding band, glinting in the firelight.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LITTLE BRAVE
{META_DATA}: (confused)
{DIALOGUE}: Your finger?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward slips his ring off.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Gold.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: While the other boys are rapt with attention, Will looks bored.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's heard this story before.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I tied my ring to the strongest line they made -- strong enough to hold up a bridge, they said, if just for a few minutes -- and I cast upriver.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. BLOOM FRONT HALL - NIGHT (1987)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward is chatting up Will's pretty DATE to the homecoming dance.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She is enjoying the story, but also the force of Edward's charisma.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's hypnotizing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: The Beast jumped up and grabbed it before the ring even hit the water.
{DIALOGUE}: And just as fast, he snapped clean through that line.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WILL, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His mother SANDRA -- from whom he gets his good looks and practicality -- stands with him at the door.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: You can see my predicament.
{DIALOGUE}: My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ON WILL AND SANDRA
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{META_DATA}: (low but insistent)
{DIALOGUE}: Make him stop.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His mother pats him sympathetically, then adjusts his tie.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL'S DATE
{DIALOGUE}: What did you do?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I followed that fish up-river and down-river for three days and three nights, until I finally had him boxed in.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will regards his father with exasperated contempt.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: With these two hands, I reached in and snatched that fish out of the river.
{DIALOGUE}: I looked him straight in the eye.
{DIALOGUE}: And I made a remarkable discovery.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. TINY PARIS RESTAURANT (LA RUE 14°) - NIGHT (1998)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WILL, now 28, sits with his gorgeous bride JOSEPHINE.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is their wedding reception, crowded with their friends and family.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They should be joyful, but Will is furious.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward has the floor, ostensibly for a toast.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The room is cozy and drunk.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: This fish, the Beast.
{DIALOGUE}: The whole time we were calling it a him, when in fact it was a her.
{DIALOGUE}: It was fat with eggs, and was going to lay them any day.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Over near the doorway, we spot Sandra, just returned from the restrooms.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She looks gorgeous.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She couldn't be any happier if this were her own wedding.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Now, I was in a situation.
{DIALOGUE}: I could gut that fish and get my ring back, but doing so I would be killing the smartest catfish in the Ashton River, soon to be mother of a hundred others.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will can't take any more.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Josephine tries to hold him back, but he gets up and leaves.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward doesn't even notice.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Did I want to deprive my soon-to-be- born son the chance to catch a fish like this of his own?
{DIALOGUE}: This lady fish and I, well, we had the same destiny.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he leaves, Will mutters in perfect unison with his father --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD AND WILL
{DIALOGUE}: We were part of the same equation.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will reaches the door, where his mother intercepts him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{DIALOGUE}: Honey, it's still your night.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will can't articulate his anger.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He just leaves.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Now, you may well ask, since this lady fish wasn't the ghost of a thief, why did it strike so quick on gold when nothing else would attract it?
{META_DATA}: (closer; he holds up his ring)
{DIALOGUE}: That was the lesson I learned that day, the day my son was born.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He focuses his words on Sandra.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This story is -- and has always been -- about her more than anyone.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Sometimes, the only way to catch an uncatchable woman is to offer her a wedding ring.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A LAUGH from the crowd.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward motions for Sandra to get up here with him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As she crosses, we can see that thirty years of marriage has not lessened their affection for each other.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As they kiss, Edward tweaks her chin a special little way.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crowd APPLAUDS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward toasts the happy couple.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Josephine covers well for her absent husband, a smile as warm as summer.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward downs his champagne in a gulp.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. OUTSIDE LA RUE 14° - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We come into the middle of an argument on the sidewalk.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Occasional PASSERSBY take notice, especially as it gets more heated.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Both men are a little drunk.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{META_DATA}: (disbelieving)
{DIALOGUE}: I am a footnote in that story.
{DIALOGUE}: I am the context for your great adventure.
{DIALOGUE}: Which never happened!
{DIALOGUE}: Incidentally!
{DIALOGUE}: You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{META_DATA}: (shaking his head)
{DIALOGUE}: Jesus Christ.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Friend of yours?
{DIALOGUE}: Did you help him out of a bind?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Come on, Will.
{DIALOGUE}: Everyone likes that story.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: No Dad, they don't.
{DIALOGUE}: I do not like the story.
{DIALOGUE}: Not anymore, not after a thousand times.
{DIALOGUE}: I know all the punchlines, Dad.
{DIALOGUE}: I can tell them as well as you can.
{META_DATA}: (closer)
{DIALOGUE}: For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom.
{DIALOGUE}: It revolves around me and my wife.
{DIALOGUE}: How can you not understand that?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A long beat, then...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{META_DATA}: (low)
{DIALOGUE}: Sorry to embarrass you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will won't let him get the last word.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: You're embarrassing yourself, Dad.
{DIALOGUE}: You just don't see it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ANGLE ON Edward.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Fine.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A hand to wave, enough of you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He walks away.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ANGLE ON Will, still fuming with righteous anger.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's then we FREEZE FRAME.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: After that night, I didn't speak to my father again for three years.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. A.P. NEWSROOM (PARIS) - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A typically busy day.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On hold with the phone cradled under an ear, Will sorts through a bundle of mail dropped on his desk.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL (ON PHONE)
{META_DATA}: (without pauses)
{DIALOGUE}: William Bloom with the Associated Press if I could just...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's put back on hold.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Returning to the mail, he finds a hand-addressed envelope.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Rips it open.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: We communicated indirectly I guess.
{DIALOGUE}: In her letters and Christmas cards, my mother would write for both of them.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. BLOOM HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At the table, Sandra talks on the phone while Edward fixes a sandwich.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: When I'd call, Mom would say that Dad was out driving.
{DIALOGUE}: Or swimming in the pool.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward takes a seat, starting to eat his sandwich.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: True to form, we never talked about our not talking.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. BLOOM HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sandra stands by the window, watching as...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. BLOOM BACK YARD - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS]
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward swims laps in the family pool.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's born to the water.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: The truth is, I didn't see anything of myself in my father, and I don't think he saw anything of himself in me.
{DIALOGUE}: We were like strangers who knew each other very well.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. RIVER - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward stares intently into the water, a lion in wait.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: In telling the story of my father's life, it's impossible to separate the fact from the fiction, the man from the myth.
{DIALOGUE}: The best I can do is to tell it the way he told me.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We LOOK DOWN at the river, where Edward's reflection is caught in the dark water.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the water ripples past, something changes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sure enough, as we LOOK UP again, it's a younger EDWARD BLOOM, 20's, staring into the water.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's not just handsome, not just charming.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's as if all the forces of the natural world had conspired to create him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: It doesn't always make sense, and most of it never happened.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, this Edward thrusts both hands into the water, grabbing hold of
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE BEAST.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He brings the catfish up to his face.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Looks it right in the eye.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat, then the Beast spits out Edward's gold ring.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: But that's what kind of story this is.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Smiling, Edward takes the ring, then throws the Beast back into the water with a splash.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: TITLE OVER:
{META_DATA}: BIG FISH
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Young Dr. Bennett stands between the Wife's legs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She's flustered and sweating, but the doctor has a comforting bedside manner...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YOUNG DR. BENNETT
{DIALOGUE}: Now, Mrs. Bloom, I'll need you to give me one good push.
{DIALOGUE}: On three.
{DIALOGUE}: One...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, we hear a POP as a slimy mass of human being rockets into the doctor's unprepared hands.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bennett tries to hold tight, but the infant is slippery like a fish.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It shoots up into air.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The NURSES and the Husband try to grab the baby, but no one can hold it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the newborn sails upward TOWARDS CAMERA, we can see a GIGGLING SMILE on its face.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As it falls, the newborn knocks over a tray, which provides it a ramp to slide right out of the room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everyone races after it.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bursting through the doors --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YOUNG DR. BENNETT
{DIALOGUE}: Grab that baby!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A NURSE finally scoops up the slippery baby.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everyone lets out a collective sigh of relief.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: My father's birth would set the pace for his unlikely life.
{DIALOGUE}: No longer than most men's, but larger.
{DIALOGUE}: And as strange as his stories got, the endings were always the most surprising of all.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. HALF-DARK PARIS APARTMENT - (PRESENT) DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Over the sound of rain, a phone RINGS on a chair.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: By the tone of the ring, we know we're not in the U.S. -- it has that insistent European sound.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As it keeps RINGING, we look to see the apartment is mostly empty, just a few half-unpacked boxes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A cradle is still in its carton.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: KEYS in the lock.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: LAUGHTER in the hallway.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The door swings open to reveal a drenched Will (29) carrying four sacks of groceries, the bottoms collapsing from the rain.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His wife Josephine (28) pushes past him to get the phone.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPHINE
{DIALOGUE}: Allo oui?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will begins stripping out of his wet clothes, each layer unleashing a new drizzle.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He plays it up, trying to get a reaction out of Josephine.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPHINE
{META_DATA}: (on phone)
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, he's here.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She hands the phone to Will, concerned.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPHINE
{DIALOGUE}: It's your mother.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Half-stripped, Will takes the phone.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This won't be good news.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{META_DATA}: (on phone)
{DIALOGUE}: Hi.
{DIALOGUE}: Uh-huh.
{DIALOGUE}: Uh-huh.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Josephine takes off her rain coat, we see she is very, very pregnant.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She listens carefully to Will's side of the conversation, trying to gauge how bad the news is.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: What does Dr. Bennett say?
{DIALOGUE}: Okay.
{DIALOGUE}: No, sure, let me talk to him.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll wait.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He covers the mouthpiece.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Looks over to Josephine.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPHINE
{DIALOGUE}: It's bad.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: It's more than they thought.
{DIALOGUE}: They're going to stop chemo.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPHINE
{DIALOGUE}: You need to go.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Probably tonight.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPHINE
{DIALOGUE}: I'm going with you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: You don't have to.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPHINE
{META_DATA}: (a simple fact)
{DIALOGUE}: I'm going with you.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. AIR FRANCE 747 - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the plane continues boarding, a STEWARDESS recites the welcome spiel in French.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will has a window seat in coach.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Josephine sits beside him, putting on hand lotion.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Taking his hands, she rubs the excess into him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There's an effortless intimacy between them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She can pinpoint what he's feeling before he can.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. 747 / FLYING - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hours later, and the lights are dimmed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Most of the PASSENGERS are asleep, including Josephine.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her head is propped against Will's shoulder, her hands tucked under her belly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will watches her sleep, brushing back her hair.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat, then he notices a BORED BOY in the next row over.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Off the glow of the reading light, the boy is using his hands to cast shadows on the seat back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The kid is pretty good, making a convincing bird, a passable monkey, and finally a dog.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We PUSH IN on the silhouettes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (O.S., PRELAP)
{DIALOGUE}: So which one's it gonna be?
{DIALOGUE}: The Monkey in the Barn, the Dog in the Road?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Focusing on the final shadow, we...
{META_DATA}: MATCH CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. BLOOM HOUSE - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ...come to find Edward making the shapes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will (6) sits in his pajamas on the floor next to him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The endtable lamp lies between them, its shade off to cast big shadows on the wall.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: The one about the witch.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore.
{DIALOGUE}: You get nightmares.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not scared.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward looks around for a beat, seeing if his wife is in earshot.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He then leans in, complicitous.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Neither was I.
{DIALOGUE}: At first.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will smiles, excited to hear the forbidden story.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: This all happened in the swamp outside of Ashton.
{DIALOGUE}: Kids weren't supposed to go out in the swamp, on account of the snakes and spiders and quicksand that would swallow you up before you could even scream.
{DIALOGUE}: But there were five of us out there that night: Me, Ruthie, Wilbur Freely, and the Price Brothers, Don and Zacky.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward holds up his hand, counting the names on his fingers.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Not a one of us knew what was in store.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As his hand moves past the light, we
{META_DATA}: COME TO:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A flashlight SWEEPS past.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We are...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. FIELD AT THE SWAMP EDGE - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The night is WHIRRING and BREATHING, alive.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The moon hangs low, casting long shadows.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Five kids walk past in silhouette.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Four have flashlights on.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The fifth keeps tripping, crashing into YOUNG EDWARD (10).
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Zacky, turn your flashlight on!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ZACKY
{DIALOGUE}: I don't got any batteries!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Red-headed ZACKY PRICE is 10.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His brother DON PRICE is 12, and a lot bigger than the others.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DON PRICE
{DIALOGUE}: Then why'd you bring it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ZACKY
{DIALOGUE}: I don't want to be in the swamp with a witch and no flashlight.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WILBUR FREELY, also 10, is the black asthmatic son of a sharecropper.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Redheaded RUTHIE MACKLIN, 8, is happy just to be there.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Is it true she got a glass eye?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILBUR FREELY
{DIALOGUE}: I heard she got it from Gypsies.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: What's a Gypsy?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ZACKY
{DIALOGUE}: Your momma's a Gypsy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DON PRICE
{DIALOGUE}: Your momma's a bitch.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RUTHIE
{DIALOGUE}: You shouldn't swear.
{DIALOGUE}: There's ladies present.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DON PRICE
{DIALOGUE}: Shit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ZACKY
{DIALOGUE}: Damn.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILBUR FREELY
{DIALOGUE}: Screw.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{META_DATA}: (whispering)
{DIALOGUE}: Turn off your flashlights!
{DIALOGUE}: She'll see 'em.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MOVING UP behind the kids, we find ourselves at the gates of...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. A CREEPY OLD HOUSE - NIGHT
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Now, it's common knowledge that most towns of a certain size have a witch, if only to eat misbehaving children and the occasional puppy who wanders into her yard.
{DIALOGUE}: Witches use those bones to cast spells and curses that make the land infertile.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We PULL BACK, and BACK, revealing more of the Gothically creepy house: its broken windows, strangling vines, and eerie gargoyles half-buried in the dirt.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Even bats are afraid to fly over it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In the moonlight, the house is especially sinister.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Who knows what is lurking in the shadows?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Yet of the all the witches in Alabama, there was one who was the most feared.
{DIALOGUE}: For she had one glass eye, which was said to contain mystical powers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We finally come to the kids, staring in through the gate.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILBUR FREELY
{DIALOGUE}: I hear if you look right at it, you can see how you're gonna die.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: That's bull-s-h-i-t, that is.
{DIALOGUE}: She's not even a real witch.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DON PRICE
{DIALOGUE}: You're so sure, why don't you go in and get that eye?
{DIALOGUE}: I heard she keeps it in a box on her nighttable.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward looks back at the spooky house.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DON PRICE
{DIALOGUE}: Or are you too scared?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I'll go in right now and get that eye.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DON PRICE
{DIALOGUE}: Then do it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Fine, I will.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DON PRICE
{DIALOGUE}: Fine, you do it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Fine, I'm doing it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He hands Zacky his flashlight, then starts climbing the gate.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RUTHIE
{DIALOGUE}: Edward, don't!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILBUR FREELY
{DIALOGUE}: She'll make soap out of you!
{META_DATA}: (to Ruthie)
{DIALOGUE}: That's what she does, she makes soap out of people.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward drops down on the far side of the gate.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Truth be told, Edward is scared, but he forges ahead anyway.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wilbur looks to Ruthie, and they're in complete agreement.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They get the hell out of there.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Zacky would run too, but Don holds him by the collar.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. APPROACHING THE HOUSE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward curves around the tall bushes that hide the front door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Anything could jump out of them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He steps on the porch.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The boards SQUEAL and CREAK, but he continues on.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A cat SCREAMS OUT from a broken wicker rocker.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Catching his breath, Edward reaches the front door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The doorknob is ancient brass, two projections that look like horns.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Yet Edward extends his hand, reaching closer and closer before he finally
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: RINGS THE DOORBELL.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Impossibly fast, the door opens, revealing an OLD WOMAN with a patch over her left eye.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She looks like she's been dead for years, but too stubborn to lie down.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{META_DATA}: (calm and straightforward)
{DIALOGUE}: Ma'am, my name is Edward Bloom, and there's some folks'd like to see your eye.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. BACK AT THE GATE - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Zacky and Don Price wait for Edward, each moment more convinced he's already dead.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But suddenly, he's back at the gate.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DON PRICE
{DIALOGUE}: You get the eye?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I brought it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DON PRICE
{META_DATA}: (dubious)
{DIALOGUE}: Let's see it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Old Woman steps out of the shadows behind Edward, flipping up her eye patch.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When their flashlight beam hits her left eye, it shines with a hellish glow.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We RUSH IN on Zacky, who is paralyzed by what he sees.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. FRONT PORCH OF HOUSE - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An OLD MAN -- Zacky -- stands on a wobbly stepladder, changing a lightbulb.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, the ladder gives way and he falls.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dead.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. AT THE GATE - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We RUSH IN on Don Price.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. FRATERNITY HOUSE BATHROOM - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Twenty-year old Don Price falls face-forward on the tile, face mushed in the grout.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Very much dead.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. AT THE GATE - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Don and Zacky both tremble with fear.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The latter has tears in his eyes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ZACKY
{DIALOGUE}: I saw how I was gonna die.
{DIALOGUE}: I was old, and I fell.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DON PRICE
{DIALOGUE}: I wasn't old at all.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The brothers suddenly bolt.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Still standing next to the Old Woman, Edward smiles.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. AT THE OLD WOMAN'S DOOR - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward helps her back inside.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He could leave now, but curiosity gets the better of him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I was thinking about death and all.
{DIALOGUE}: About seeing how you're gonna die.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Old Woman turns to him slightly, still not facing him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I mean, on one hand, if dying was all you thought about, it could kind of screw you up.
{DIALOGUE}: But it could kind of help you, couldn't it?
{DIALOGUE}: Because you'd know that everything else you can survive.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Old Woman smiles a little, a crooked grin of broken teeth.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I guess I'm saying, I'd like to know.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Old Woman turns leaning her face right in front of his.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And on a silent count of one, two, three -- Edward looks into The Eye.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This time we don't cut.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Instead, we HOLD ON Edward as he witnesses his death.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stares transfixed, perplexed and amused.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Whatever he sees, it's not as dire as the other boys.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His future has something strange in store.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Huh.
{DIALOGUE}: That's how I go?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Old Woman nods.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{DIALOGUE}: You don't think he looks any worse.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. BENNETT
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: I would say he's the same.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And in the silence that follows, a lot is said.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It wasn't the upbeat reply Sandra was hoping for.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Can I see him?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. BENNETT
{DIALOGUE}: Absolutely.
{DIALOGUE}: Be good for you to talk to him.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Did you do any of that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: No, but I hear it's terrible.
{DIALOGUE}: Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.

{DIALOGUE}: You think I'm up for it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: You learned from the best.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Fine.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will cracks open the can, finding a straw on the nightstand.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: People needn't worry so much.
{DIALOGUE}: It's not my time yet.

{DIALOGUE}: Truly.
{DIALOGUE}: I saw it in The Eye.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: The Old Lady by the swamp.

{DIALOGUE}: She was a witch.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: No, she was old and probably senile.
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe schizophrenic.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I saw my death in that eye.
{DIALOGUE}: And this is not how it happens.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: So how does it happen?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Surprise ending.
{DIALOGUE}: Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward slurps down as much of the Ensure as he can stand, then pushes the can away.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Okay.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: And every day I gave him a quarter.
{DIALOGUE}: Every day.
{DIALOGUE}: Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks.
{DIALOGUE}: And when I went back there, you know what he said?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: What did he say?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: You owe me three-fifty.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Really.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: True story.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: When did you ever work in an office?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: There's a lot you don't know about me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: You're right.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward gives a wry smile.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He walked into that.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Your mother was worried we wouldn't talk again.
{DIALOGUE}: And look at us.

{DIALOGUE}: We're storytellers, both of us.
{DIALOGUE}: I speak mine out, you write yours down.
{DIALOGUE}: Same thing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will won't commit to Edward's assessment.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: You mean, while I'm here.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: I'd just like to know the true versions of things.
{DIALOGUE}: Events.
{DIALOGUE}: Stories.
{DIALOGUE}: You.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward LAUGHS a little, which becomes a COUGH.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The HACKING escalates until another drink of water gets it under control.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's not clear whether any of this was an act to keep from talking.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool.
{DIALOGUE}: If you wanted to you could...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: I will.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: You know where the chemicals are?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: I used to do it when you were gone, remember?
{DIALOGUE}: I used to do it a lot.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He didn't mean for that to sound so pointed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Taking the half- empty Ensure, Will gets up to go.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's at the door when...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I was never much for being at home, Will.
{DIALOGUE}: It's too confining.
{DIALOGUE}: And this, here.
{DIALOGUE}: Being stuck in bed.
{DIALOGUE}: Dying is the worst thing that ever happened to me.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He smiles at his joke.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: I thought you weren't dying.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I said this isn't how I go.
{DIALOGUE}: The last part is much more unusual.
{DIALOGUE}: Trust me on that.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shutting the door behind himself, Will drinks the rest of the Ensure himself.

{DIALOGUE}: I had made it all the way to the "G's," hoping to find an answer to my gigantificationism, when I uncovered an article about the common goldfish.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INSERT: The encyclopedia article, complete with drawings.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YOUNG EDWARD
{META_DATA}: (reading)

{DIALOGUE}: With more space, the fish can grow double, triple, or quadruple its size."
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Young Edward thinks this through.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: It occurred to me then, that perhaps the reason for my growth was that I was intended for larger things.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. HILL OUTSIDE ASHTON - DAY

{DIALOGUE}: GO AWAY!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The giant's voice has such force, it blows Edward's hair back.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not going anywhere until you show yourself.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat, then we hear a RUMBLE, like a train coming.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward braces himself, fists ready for a fight, if that's what it's going to take.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the RUMBLE gets louder, the ground starts to shake.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Even Edward starts to worry.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just how big is this guy?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Armed with the foreknowledge of my own death, I knew the giant couldn't kill me.
{DIALOGUE}: All the same, I preferred to keep my bones unbroken.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward picks up a stone, ready to play David to Goliath.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then suddenly, the giant bursts forth.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hunched over, he slams into a stunned Edward, knocking him halfway down the hill.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: KARL THE GIANT is bigger than any man you've ever seen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Not just tall, but massive.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's completely feral, with a beard to his elbow and skin scratched and blistered.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: What remains of his clothes are ragged and muddy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: God knows what's living in his matted hair.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Karl leans over Edward, blocking the sun.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward throws his rock, but it just bounces off.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The giant didn't even notice it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KARL
{DIALOGUE}: Why are you here?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward ponders the best response, settling on...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: So you can eat me.
{DIALOGUE}: The town decided to send a human sacrifice, and I volunteered.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Karl's eyes narrow, confused.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward stands up.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: My arms are a little stringy, but there's some good eating on my legs.
{DIALOGUE}: I mean, I'd be tempted to eat them myself.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: So I guess, just, if you could get it over with quick.
{DIALOGUE}: Because I'm not much for pain, really.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward closes his eyes, hands at his side, ready to be eaten.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Karl just stares at him, not sure what to do.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After a beat, Edward opens his eyes a tiny bit, just to see what the giant is doing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Relieved to see he's not licking his chops --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Look, I can't go back.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm a human sacrifice.
{DIALOGUE}: If I go back, everyone will think I'm a coward.
{DIALOGUE}: And I'd rather be dinner than a coward.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Karl sits down with a BOOM, dejected.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Here, start with my hand.
{DIALOGUE}: It'll be an appetizer.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Reaching up, Edward shoves his hand into Karl's mouth.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But the giant spits it back out.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KARL
{DIALOGUE}: I don't want to eat you.
{DIALOGUE}: I don't want to eat anybody.
{DIALOGUE}: It's just I get so hungry.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm too big.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And that's the sad truth.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Karl is less a monster than a freak -- a giant man, but in the end, just a man.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward takes a seat beside him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Did you ever think maybe you're not too big?
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe this town's just too small.
{DIALOGUE}: I mean, look at it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Circling behind them, we look down at Ashton -- a tiny town in a tiny valley.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Hardly two stories in the whole place.
{DIALOGUE}: Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KARL
{DIALOGUE}: Really?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Wouldn't lie to you.
{DIALOGUE}: And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets.
{DIALOGUE}: You can eat a lot, can't you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KARL
{DIALOGUE}: I can.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: So why are you wasting your time in a small town?
{DIALOGUE}: You're a big man.
{DIALOGUE}: You should be in the big city.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Karl smiles, but then it fades.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A certain sad suspicion --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KARL
{DIALOGUE}: You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you?
{DIALOGUE}: That's why they sent you here.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: What's your name, Giant?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KARL
{DIALOGUE}: Karl.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Mine's Edward.
{DIALOGUE}: And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl.
{DIALOGUE}: But I want to leave with you.
{META_DATA}: (closer)
{DIALOGUE}: You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition.
{DIALOGUE}: I can't see staying here a day longer.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KARL
{DIALOGUE}: You don't like it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I love every square inch of it.
{DIALOGUE}: But I can feel the edges closing in on me.
{DIALOGUE}: A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: So what do you say?
{DIALOGUE}: Join me?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Karl thinks a moment.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KARL
{DIALOGUE}: Okay.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD

{DIALOGUE}: Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton, it's with a heavy heart we see you go.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward ducks a bit so the Mayor can put the key around his neck.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crowd CHEERS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And with that, Edward and Karl start walking, waving as they go.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Only DON PRICE, smoking on the corner, isn't sad to see Edward go.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He crushes his cigarette under his heel.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He wishes he could crush Edward.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Many of the townfolk come onto the street to hug Edward or shake his hand.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: That afternoon as I left Ashton, everyone seemed to have advice.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VARIOUS TOWNFOLK
{DIALOGUE}: Find yourself a nice girl!
{DIALOGUE}: Don't trust anyone in Kentucky!
{DIALOGUE}: Watch your pride, Edward Bloom!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: But there was one person whose counsel I held above all others.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the crowd parts, he finds himself face to face with
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE OLD WOMAN.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been cast.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She motions for Edward to lean down, so she can whisper something to him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Although we're VERY CLOSE, we can't hear her voice.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: She said that the biggest fish in the river gets that way by never being caught.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The advice only succeeds in confusing Edward.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{META_DATA}: (to the Old Woman)
{DIALOGUE}: Okay.
{DIALOGUE}: Thanks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward and Karl keep walking.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Old Woman shuffles off, somehow knowing her advice will go unheeded.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KARL
{DIALOGUE}: What did she say?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Beats me.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. ROAD - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We TILT UP from the road to reveal Edward and Karl walking out of Ashton.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Each wears a backpack with all his earthly possessions.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: There were two roads out of Ashton, a new one which was paved, and an older one that wasn't.
{DIALOGUE}: People didn't use the old road anymore, and it had developed the reputation of being haunted.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward and Karl come to a bend, where the paved road veers left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The old road is blocked with signs and warnings of danger.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Since I had no intention of ever returning to Ashton, this seemed as good a time as any to find out what lay down that old road.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Karl looks at the dirt road, wary.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KARL
{DIALOGUE}: You know anyone's who's taken it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: That poet, Norther Winslow did.
{DIALOGUE}: He was going to Paris, France.
{DIALOGUE}: He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Tell you what.
{DIALOGUE}: You take the other way and I'll cut through here.
{DIALOGUE}: Meet you on the far side.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A little paranoid...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KARL
{DIALOGUE}: You're not trying to run away?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Karl perks up, even though it means more for him to carry.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The road is overgrown, but not altogether creepy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The sun is still shining, and the birds still CHIRPING.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spinning the Key to the City, Edward WHISTLES, because it's a day meant for whistling.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. FURTHER ALONG - ROUGH PATH
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The road has narrowed to a rough path.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Spikes of sunlight break through the thick canopy, catching particles in the air.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Still, Edward WHISTLES.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Coming around a bend, his PITCH DROPS as he sees thick, thorny vines growing across the path.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stops.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For the first time, he realizes the birds have stopped singing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The forest is dead quiet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks back the way he came.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's tempting to go back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It would be easier to go back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But Edward presses on.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He carefully steps through the thorns.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His trouser legs catch on the barbs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We can hear the fabric TEAR.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: FURTHER ALONG
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A scratched and sweaty Edward waves off various STINGING BUGS flying at him, finally whipping off his hat to swat at them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just then a CAWING crow swoops down and grabs the hat right out of his hands.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: You stupid sonofa...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stops his swearing, but grabs a rock and throws it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The stone ricochets off a tree and into a BEE'S NEST.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The swarm roars out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward high-tails it, each step still precarious.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. THE DARK FOREST - DAY [LATER]
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward is bruised, battered and bee-stung.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A half-broken sign lies in the road.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward picks it up.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Reads it:
{META_DATA}: WARNING!
{META_DATA}: JUMPING SPIDERS!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sure enough, up ahead he sees the path is overgrown with thick cobwebs, heavy from the rain.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: There comes a point where a reasonable man will swallow his pride and admit he's made a terrible mistake.
{DIALOGUE}: The truth is, I was never a reasonable man.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward tosses the sign and forges ahead, into the spiderwebs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: And what I recalled of Sunday School was that the more difficult something became, the more rewarding it was in the end.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. CLEARING / THE ROAD - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward emerges from the forest, brushing the last cobwebs off and shaking the spiders from his shirt.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: One is stuck in his sleeve, and he has to dance to get it out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Even then, he still keeps twitching, convinced another one is left behind.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty and comforting.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ahead lies a tiny one-street town -- smaller even than Ashton -- with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dangling from the line above he sees two dozen pairs of shoes, their laces tied together.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He passes a sign that reads "Welcome To Spectre!"
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. THE TOWN OF SPECTRE - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's a main street with stores on each side: Cole's Pharmacy, Talbot's Five and Dime, Al's Country Store.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everything is old, but this isn't a ghost town.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In fact, there's a group of about 20 CITIZENS spilling out to see Edward approach.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Most are smiling.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There are even a few tears of joy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: What's more, all of these people are barefoot.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAN'S VOICE
{DIALOGUE}: Friend!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A forty-year old man named BEAMEN comes out of the seed store to greet Edward.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Friendly but a little drunk, he's the closest thing the town has to a mayor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's carrying a clipboard.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEAMEN
{DIALOGUE}: Welcome to ya.
{DIALOGUE}: What's your name?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Edward Bloom.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beamen checks the clipboard.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Not finding the name, he flips forward a few pages.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Still looking...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEAMEN
{DIALOGUE}: Bloom like a flower?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEAMEN
{DIALOGUE}: Oh.
{DIALOGUE}: Here!
{DIALOGUE}: Right here.
{DIALOGUE}: Edward Bloom.
{DIALOGUE}: We weren't expecting you yet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Still confused...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: You were expecting me?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEAMEN
{DIALOGUE}: Not yet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A helpful woman named MILDRED chimes in:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILDRED
{DIALOGUE}: You must have taken a shortcut.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I did.
{DIALOGUE}: It nearly killed me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEAMEN
{DIALOGUE}: Mmm-hmm.
{DIALOGUE}: Life'll do that to you.
{DIALOGUE}: And truthfully, the long way is easier, but it's longer.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILDRED
{DIALOGUE}: Much longer.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEAMEN
{DIALOGUE}: And you're here now, and that's what matters.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beamen's daughter JENNY (8) hides behind her father, peering around to look at the handsome stranger.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: What is this place?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEAMEN
{DIALOGUE}: The town of Spectre.
{DIALOGUE}: Best kept secret in Alabama.
{DIALOGUE}: Says here you're from Ashton, right?
{DIALOGUE}: Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: The poet?
{DIALOGUE}: What ever happened to him?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEAMEN
{DIALOGUE}: He's still here.
{DIALOGUE}: Let me buy you a drink.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll tell you all about it.
{DIALOGUE}: Hell, I'll have him tell you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: I've gotta meet somebody.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm already running late.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He didn't mean it as a joke, but for some reason, everyone's laughing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEAMEN
{DIALOGUE}: Son, I already told you.
{DIALOGUE}: You're early.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. BEAMEN'S HOUSE - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sitting at the kitchen table, Edward takes a second slice of apple pie.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He and Beamen are joined by NORTHER WINSLOW (30), who fancies himself a cultured artist, though he's never left the state.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEAMEN
{DIALOGUE}: Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: It truly is.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: UNDER THE TABLE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Young Jenny is stealthily untying the laces on Edward's shoes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NORTHER WINSLOW
{DIALOGUE}: Everything here tastes better.
{DIALOGUE}: Even the water is sweet.
{DIALOGUE}: Never gets too hot, too cold, too humid.
{DIALOGUE}: At night the wind goes through the trees and you'd swear there was a whole symphony out there, playing just for you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, Jenny YANKS OFF Edward's shoes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She races for the door.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Hey!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He chases after her.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TOWN / MAIN STREET - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As she runs, Jenny ties Edward's laces together.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Reaching the edge of town, she tosses the shoes up and around the power line -- a perfect throw.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There's no way he's ever getting them down.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The gathered citizens of Spectre CHEER for Edward, who is confused and overwhelmed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The women hug him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Men shake his hand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Still focused on his shoes...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Wait!
{DIALOGUE}: I need those!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NORTHER WINSLOW
{DIALOGUE}: There is no softer ground than town.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILDRED
{DIALOGUE}: That rhymes!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEAMEN
{DIALOGUE}: He is our poet laureate.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The townsfolk continue to congratulate Edward...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Sometimes in a dream, you'll visit places that seem instantly familiar, filled with friends you've never met.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. UNDER A TREE - DUSK
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward sits with Norther Winslow.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The fireflies are out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Thousands of them.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: A man might travel his entire life and never find a place so inviting.
{DIALOGUE}: My journey had scarcely begun, and I had arrived.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norther hands him his noteboook.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NORTHER WINSLOW
{DIALOGUE}: I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Really.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NORTHER WINSLOW
{DIALOGUE}: There's a lot of expectation.
{DIALOGUE}: I don't want to disappoint my fans.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: It's only three lines long.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norther grabs his notebook back.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NORTHER WINSLOW
{DIALOGUE}: This is why you don't show work in progress.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NORTHER WINSLOW
{DIALOGUE}: I can't imagine any place better than here.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: You're a poet.
{DIALOGUE}: You oughta be able to.
{DIALOGUE}: And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norther doesn't answer.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just goes back to his notebook.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. BY THE RIVER - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: By the light of the full moon, Edward soaks his feet in the water, trying to make sense of it all.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Key to the City dangles around his neck.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stares at himself in the reflection.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He smiles.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's then that a WOMAN emerges at the far side of the river.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: No telling where she came from -- she must have been swimming underwater.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We never see her face.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She stands in the river with her bare back to Edward, squeezing the water out of her golden hair, oblivious to his presence.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward is breathless.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's the first woman he's seen in her natural state, and he doesn't dare move lest he frighten her away.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he sees the snake.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's a cottonmouth, has to be.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It leaves a break in the water, its small reptilian head aiming for her flesh.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There's no decision to be made.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On pure instinct, Edward dives in.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He swims as hard as can,
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: GRABBING THE SNAKE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: just as it's about to strike.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The woman dives back underwater, understandably terrified that a man is coming at her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: No, it's okay!
{DIALOGUE}: I got it.
{DIALOGUE}: I got the snake.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the splashing subsides, Edward looks at what he holds in his hands.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Which isn't a snake at all, but rather a common stick.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And a non-threatening one at that.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: While Edward ponders his mistake, he looks around to discover that the Girl in the River is gone.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He never even saw her face.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Wait!
{DIALOGUE}: I'm sorry.
{DIALOGUE}: Hello?!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward keeps expecting her to surface, somewhere, but she never does.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stands alone in the river, wondering what tricks his eyes are playing on him.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. BY THE RIVER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
{CHARACTER_NAME}: A GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: There's leeches in there!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward looks to the bank, where young Jenny Hill is watching him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Did you see that woman?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: What did she look like?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Well, she... uh...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: Was she nekkid?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Embarrassed to admit it...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{META_DATA}: (matter-of-fact)
{DIALOGUE}: It's not a woman, it's a fish.
{DIALOGUE}: No one ever catches her.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Given the day he's had so far, Edward isn't inclined to follow up on the issue.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He starts to wade back to the bank.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: Fish looks diff'rent to diff'rent people.
{DIALOGUE}: My daddy said it looked like the coon dog he had when he was kid, back from the dead.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward climbs up onto the shore, completely drenched.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pulls up his pant legs to reveal three shiny leeches clinging to his skin.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Shoot.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He starts to work pulling them off.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. PATH BACK TO TOWN - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward and Jenny walk back.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: How old are you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Eighteen.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: I'm eight.
{DIALOGUE}: That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28.
{DIALOGUE}: And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{META_DATA}: (a little wary)
{DIALOGUE}: You're pretty good at arithmetic.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: And when I'm 38, you'll be 48.
{DIALOGUE}: And that's not much difference at all.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Eager to get off this subject...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Sure is a lot now, though, huh?
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Edward and Jenny approach Main Street, they find "downtown" has been transformed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lanterns and streamers hang on cables across the street, and a small stage has been built at one end to hold FIDDLERS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen, Edward Bloom.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Before he can protest, two WOMEN have grabbed him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The resulting dance number seems both choreographed and complete chaos.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: From FARMER to BAKER'S WIFE, everyone wants to dance with Edward, who finds himself tossed around like a stick caught in a whirlpool.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Still, he's having a blast.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jenny grabs both his hands, and they spin wildly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beamen plucks his LAUGHING daughter away to dance with her.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then Mildred cuts in to dance with Edward.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's hard to hear over the MUSIC.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILDRED
{DIALOGUE}: Jenny thinks you're quite a catch.
{DIALOGUE}: We all do.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{META_DATA}: (not hearing)
{DIALOGUE}: What?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MILDRED
{DIALOGUE}: I said you're quite a catch!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward stops dancing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat, then he heads for the edge of the crowd.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beamen is there, with Jenny on his shoulders.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I have to leave.
{DIALOGUE}: Tonight.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEAMEN
{DIALOGUE}: Why?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: This town is everything a man could ask for.
{DIALOGUE}: And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky.
{DIALOGUE}: But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEAMEN
{DIALOGUE}: No one's ever left.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I suspect it will hurt a lot.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And with that, Edward walks down Main Street.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The townspeople stop dancing, disbelieving, some shaking their heads.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Poor Edward Bloom's gone crazy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEAMEN
{META_DATA}: (calling after him)
{DIALOGUE}: You won't find a better place!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I don't expect to.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jenny runs to him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She'd tackle him if she could.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: Promise me you'll come back.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I promise.
{DIALOGUE}: Someday.
{DIALOGUE}: When I'm really supposed to.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's not good enough, but it will have to do.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward keeps walking.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. THE DARK FOREST - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: VARIOUS SHOTS: Edward negotiates the thorns in his bare feet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's horrible.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Almost unendurable.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then it gets worse.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The trees ahead are moving.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At first, it just seems to be the wind blowing the branches, but as we hear the wood CRACKING and GROANING, there's no mistaking it: they're trying to block him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Snake-like WHITE ROOTS shoot out of the ground, grabbing for his ankles.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He leaps up, kicking off one tree trunk to grab another one's branches.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He swings off, lands and rolls.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now all the trees are moving to block him, their dark shapes towering over him in the flashes of LIGHTNING.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: As difficult as it was to reach Spectre, I was fated to get there eventually.
{DIALOGUE}: After all, no man can avoid reaching the end of his life.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he ducks under branches, the chain holding the Key to the City gets caught.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's almost strangled, but the chain finally breaks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The silver key disappears into the mud.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Scrambling forward, he looks for a way out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But the trees have encircled him, their spiky crowns bending down to crush him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He SCREAMS up at the night, until his breath is gone.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: And then I realized, this wasn't the end of my life.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With a sudden calm...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{META_DATA}: (aloud)
{DIALOGUE}: This isn't how I die.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Another lightning FLASH, and suddenly the trees are back where they've always been.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward is lying shoeless and torn in a muddy puddle, staring up at the rain.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And LAUGHING.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. THE ROAD - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His bare foot steps onto asphalt.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: A DEEP VOICE
{DIALOGUE}: Friend!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward turns to see
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: KARL
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: to his right, coming down the larger, paved road.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KARL
{DIALOGUE}: What happened to your shoes?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward looks down at his muddy, bloody feet.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: They got ahead of me.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With that, the men start walking down the larger road.
{META_DATA}: CROSSFADE TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward and Will sit at opposite ends of the table, with Sandra and Josephine in the middle.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Although Edward has a small plate of food in front of him, he hasn't touched it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's exhausted from the trip downstairs, but determined to maintain the family dinner ritual.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The other three eat awkwardly, each CLINK and SCRAPE of a knife or fork resonating.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will finally breaks the silence.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{DIALOGUE}: Really!
{DIALOGUE}: That's wonderful.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPHINE
{DIALOGUE}: I spent a week in Morocco for the story.
{DIALOGUE}: It was incredible.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{DIALOGUE}: We'll have to pick up a copy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Will scoops out another serving of potatoes, Edward suddenly speaks:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know if you're aware of this, Josephine, but African parrots, in their native home of the Congo -- they speak only French.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All three stop to listen.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPHINE
{META_DATA}: (amused)
{DIALOGUE}: Really.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: You're lucky to get four words out of them in English.
{DIALOGUE}: But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French.
{DIALOGUE}: Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Taking the bait...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Why not religion, Dad?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: It's rude to talk about religion.
{DIALOGUE}: You never know who you're going to offend.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, so you know.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will shakes a shopping cart free from the pile-up while his mother checks her list.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: AT THE PRODUCE SECTION
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sandra starts to bag string beans.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{DIALOGUE}: Of course.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: How is that possible?
{DIALOGUE}: I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.
{META_DATA}: (decidedly)
{DIALOGUE}: You can't honestly say you know him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, Will, I do.
{DIALOGUE}: And don't presume things you don't know.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She's more amused than annoyed, but Will is entering dangerous territory.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{DIALOGUE}: Would you say you understand Josephine?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{DIALOGUE}: But that's a different...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{DIALOGUE}: No it's not.
{DIALOGUE}: It's exactly the same.
{DIALOGUE}: Your father and I met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level.
{DIALOGUE}: Just the same as you two.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She moves on to the carrots.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Josephine and I have a lot in common.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife.
{DIALOGUE}: And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother.
{DIALOGUE}: You can't discount that.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: True.
{DIALOGUE}: But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all.
{DIALOGUE}: Or ever will.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With a look, Sandra acknowledges the stakes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{DIALOGUE}: I know it's not easy.
{DIALOGUE}: Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son.
{DIALOGUE}: You just ended up together.
{DIALOGUE}: You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same.
{DIALOGUE}: If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: But I understand you, Mom.
{DIALOGUE}: I always have.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{DIALOGUE}: Well, clearly you don't.
{DIALOGUE}: But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. AT THE CHECKOUT - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Reaching the CASHIER, Sandra hands over her coupons.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will is approaching with a Newsweek magazine.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Two checkstands over, an ATTRACTIVE BLONDE WOMAN in her 50's
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: is getting her change.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Though she's Sandra's generation, she carries herself like a much younger woman, with blue jeans and sneakers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She accidentally makes eye contact with Will as he passes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We HOLD ON the woman, who tracks Will as he reaches Sandra.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's hard to read her reaction: does she recognize him, or just find him attractive?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will notices the gaze.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The woman turns away.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Josephine motions, is it okay for her to sit on the bed?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I don't usually remember unless they're especially portentous.
{DIALOGUE}: You know what that word means, portentous?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She shakes her head.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.
{META_DATA}: (beat, gathering)
{DIALOGUE}: Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die."
{DIALOGUE}: I was so scared I woke up my parents.
{DIALOGUE}: They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed.
{DIALOGUE}: But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPHINE
{DIALOGUE}: That's terrible.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power.
{DIALOGUE}: Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "Your Grampa is going to die."
{DIALOGUE}: Well, I ran right back to my parents.

{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Well, I didn't know what to do.
{DIALOGUE}: But finally I told my father.
{DIALOGUE}: And he said not to worry, but I could tell he was rattled.
{DIALOGUE}: That next day, he wasn't himself, always looking around, waiting for something to drop on his head.
{DIALOGUE}: Because the crow didn't tell how it was going to happen, just those words: your Daddy is going to die.
{DIALOGUE}: Well, he went into town early and was gone for a long time.
{DIALOGUE}: And when he finally came back, he looked terrible, like he was waiting for the axe to fall all day.
{DIALOGUE}: He said to my mother, "Good God.
{DIALOGUE}: I just had the worst day of my life."
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: "You think you've had a bad day," she said.
{DIALOGUE}: "This morning the milkman dropped dead on the porch!"

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPHINE (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: I have photos from the wedding to show you.
{DIALOGUE}: There's a great one of you and my father.
{DIALOGUE}: I had an extra print made.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward grimaces, a flash of pain.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Around others, he's hiding how much it hurts, but alone we can see how bad it is.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He controls his breathing, trying to push through it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPHINE
{DIALOGUE}: I want to see pictures of your wedding.
{DIALOGUE}: I've never seen any.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She returns with her camera.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward smiles, doing a good job masking the pain.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: That's because we didn't have a wedding.
{DIALOGUE}: Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me.
{DIALOGUE}: She was engaged to somebody else.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPHINE
{META_DATA}: (loading film)

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: From behind Amos, CARNIES start rolling a massive ball towards the crowd.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: AMOS

{META_DATA}: (she trembles)
{DIALOGUE}: But he won't.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There's a GASP from the crowd, along with nervous anticipation -- what will happen next?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: They say when you meet the love of your life, time stops.
{DIALOGUE}: And that's true.
{DIALOGUE}: What they don't tell you, is that once time starts again, it moves extra fast to catch up.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, everything RUSHES.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: AMOS
{DIALOGUE}: Sorry, kid.
{DIALOGUE}: I don't do charity.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I'll work night and day, and you won't have to pay me.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He watches as Sandra puts the cap back on the syrup.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Did I ever tell you about how...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{META_DATA}: (interrupting)
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward is startled.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: The maple tree and the Buick.
{DIALOGUE}: We heard it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{META_DATA}: (re: Josephine)
{DIALOGUE}: I think someone hasn't.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPHINE
{DIALOGUE}: The tree fell on the car, spilling the syrup, which attracted the flies, which got stuck to it and flew off with the whole car.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{META_DATA}: (undeterred)
{DIALOGUE}: But the real story is how I got the car.
{DIALOGUE}: You see...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{META_DATA}: (interrupting)
{DIALOGUE}: Dad?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Son?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Can we talk?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sandra SNAPS the cap back on the syrup.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{DIALOGUE}: I'm going to get started on dishes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPHINE
{DIALOGUE}: I'll help you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Both women quickly gather plates.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will and Edward both smile.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The women clearly want this to happen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It settles for a beat after they leave.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Do I?
{DIALOGUE}: I saw an iceberg once.
{DIALOGUE}: They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside.
{DIALOGUE}: The woolly kind.
{DIALOGUE}: A mammoth.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{META_DATA}: (interrupting)
{DIALOGUE}: Dad!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: What?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Then you shouldn't have started with a question.
{DIALOGUE}: Because people want to answer questions.
{DIALOGUE}: You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{META_DATA}: (frustrated)
{DIALOGUE}: The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them.
{DIALOGUE}: The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it.
{DIALOGUE}: And that's what it is with you Dad.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{META_DATA}: (joking)
{DIALOGUE}: What, you're seeing down to my nose?
{DIALOGUE}: My chin?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I've told you a thousand facts.
{DIALOGUE}: That's all I do, Will.
{DIALOGUE}: I tell stories.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: You tell lies, Dad.
{DIALOGUE}: You tell amusing lies.
{DIALOGUE}: Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime.
{DIALOGUE}: They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty.
{DIALOGUE}: And the thing is, I believed you.
{DIALOGUE}: I believed your stories so much longer than I should have.
{DIALOGUE}: And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything!
{DIALOGUE}: -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you.
{DIALOGUE}: You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined.
{DIALOGUE}: Just as charming and just as fake.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: You think I'm fake.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Only on the surface.
{DIALOGUE}: But that's all I've ever seen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward looks away, angry and disbelieving.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here.
{DIALOGUE}: It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: It would kill you, huh?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Finally --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: What do you want, Will?
{DIALOGUE}: Who do you want me to be?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Yourself.
{DIALOGUE}: Good, bad, everything.
{DIALOGUE}: Just show me who you are for once.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born.
{DIALOGUE}: And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With a skimmer pole, Will cleans the leaves and debris out of the pool, but it's a fool's errand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The pool has long since gone native, a shiny slick of algae on the surface, slime covering the cemented rocks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, an underwater shape RIPPLES against the water's surface.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will is so startled that he drops the pole, which disappears into the murky water.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks around, relieved that no one saw that.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He casually walks away.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The doors open to reveal Sandra, Will and Josephine, staring into the mouth of oblivion.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The storeroom is a museum of hasty decisions and half-finished projects: partially built outboard motors, dead bonsai trees, Frankensteinian lawnmowers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We also find boxes of products Edward used to sell.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clearing a path, Sandra leads Will to a roll-top desk, its ribs covered in dust.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Two beaten metal file cabinets sit beside it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{DIALOGUE}: Your father decided he needed to have an office, and it wouldn't do to have it in the house.
{DIALOGUE}: You'll know better than me what's important.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With some effort, Will forces up the desktop.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With a HISS, a neighbor's cat makes a run for it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will's getting used to being startled.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY [LATER]
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will, Sandra and Josephine have worked through two trash bags of papers to throw out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Looking through a new file, Sandra makes a small sound.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A memory.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: What is it?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sandra hands Will a yellowed telegram.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He shares it with Josephine.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{DIALOGUE}: It was during the war.
{DIALOGUE}: Your father went missing.
{DIALOGUE}: They thought he was dead.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will can't believe what he's reading.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: That really happened?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{DIALOGUE}: Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat, then Sandra stands.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{DIALOGUE}: I'm going to check on him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPHINE
{DIALOGUE}: I need to lie down for a bit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Go.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Josephine kisses him, then follows Sandra.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will re-reads the telegram, still bewildered.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Looking for a place to put it, he tucks it into a strange mechanical hand on the desk.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It clamps down automatically.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will smiles, a memory.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He hasn't thought about this device in years.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We slowly PUSH IN on the telegram, held in the hand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward's VOICE begins as a memory...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: After the war, the sons of Alabama returned home, looking for work.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. COUNTY FAIR - DAY [STORY]
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On a low platform, Edward pitches a brilliant new product to the crowd.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I've travelled from Tennessee to Timbuktu, and if there's one thing people have in common, is we could all use a hand around the house.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward sets down a contraption, which looks something like a metal lava lamp.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Like a flower, it unfolds to reveal five fingers and a thumb.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is the Hand Around the House.
{META_DATA}: (TM)
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Why, with this product you can...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: QUICK MONTAGE as he demonstrates:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Open a jar.
{DIALOGUE}: Open a letter.
{DIALOGUE}: Scratch yourself while wearing mittens.
{DIALOGUE}: Hold a book.
{DIALOGUE}: Hold a baby.
{DIALOGUE}: Hold the dog away from kittens.
{DIALOGUE}: It's strong enough, you can do a handstand with no hands at all.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Indeed, a remarkably agile Edward is able to support his entire weight on it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crowd APPLAUDS.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: You can use it to point out important information.
{DIALOGUE}: Or dangers.
{DIALOGUE}: Or beautiful women.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The hand points a finger at an HEAVYSET MAN IN OVERALLS.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: We're still working on that one.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)

{DIALOGUE}: It's me.
{DIALOGUE}: Norther Winslow.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The men shake, disbelieving this lucky coincidence.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I don't believe it!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NORTHER WINSLOW
{DIALOGUE}: I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes.
{DIALOGUE}: There was a whole life out there that I was not living.
{DIALOGUE}: So I travelled.
{DIALOGUE}: I saw France, and Africa, half of South America.
{DIALOGUE}: Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: That's great, Norther.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm happy for you.
{DIALOGUE}: I can't believe I helped.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's genuinely proud.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: So what are you up to now?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NORTHER WINSLOW
{DIALOGUE}: I'm robbing this place.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Reaching the front of the line, Norther pulls two pistols out of his coat, FIRING both into the ceiling.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SCREAMS all around.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The skinny SECURITY GUARD makes a halfhearted reach for his gun, but Norther waves him off.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The guard takes out his gun and slides it over.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NORTHER WINSLOW
{META_DATA}: (to Edward)
{DIALOGUE}: Would you mind grabbing that?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There's nothing threatening about his delivery -- he might as well be asking for a Budweiser.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Still, Edward senses it would be best to do as he says.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes the guard's gun.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NORTHER WINSLOW
{META_DATA}: (to the crowd)
{DIALOGUE}: Now, I want all of you to lie down.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm gonna be cleaning out the cash drawers, and my associate here is going to handle the vault.
{META_DATA}: (pointing to a Teller Woman)
{DIALOGUE}: You help my friend, okay?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The TELLER WOMAN nods.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ANGLE ON Edward, not sure what to do.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He has a gun, but he truly doesn't want to shoot Norther.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He decides he better go.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. AT THE VAULT - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Teller Woman is crying as she works the combination.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She pulls open the vault door.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. THE VAULT - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The inner sanctum of the Horizon Savings and Loan holds exactly one folding chair.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Nothing else.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TELLER WOMAN
{DIALOGUE}: ...there's no money.
{DIALOGUE}: We're completely bankrupt.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: It turned out the savings and loan had already been robbed -- not by armed bandits, but by speculators in Texas real estate.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TELLER WOMAN
{META_DATA}: (dead serious)
{DIALOGUE}: You gotta promise you won't tell anybody.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. EDWARD'S CAR - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward drives the getaway car, though truthfully they're going just a little over the speed limit.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: No one's following them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's an empty country road for miles.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norther HOLLERS with body-tingling joy as he counts the money.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NORTHER WINSLOW
{DIALOGUE}: Sixty.
{DIALOGUE}: Eighty.
{DIALOGUE}: Four hundred dollars!
{DIALOGUE}: Not bad for just the drawers.
{DIALOGUE}: Let's see what you got from the vault.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward winces, but doesn't say anything yet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Digging through the vault bag, Norther is surprised to find only a single deposit envelope.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He rips it open, revealing just a little cash inside.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Even some dimes and pennies.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NORTHER WINSLOW
{DIALOGUE}: This is it?
{DIALOGUE}: The whole vault.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: 'Fraid so.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NORTHER WINSLOW
{DIALOGUE}: Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Caught, Edward has to confess...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Look, I just didn't want you to go empty-handed.
{DIALOGUE}: There's something you should know, Norther.
{DIALOGUE}: You see, the reason why...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward continues his narration...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: I told Norther about the vagaries of Texas oil money and its effect on real estate prices, and how lax enforcement of fiduciary process had made savings and loans particularly vulnerable.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hearing this news, Norther was left with one conclusion:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TEXAS ROAD - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Norther leans in the driver's side window.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NORTHER WINSLOW
{DIALOGUE}: I should go to Wall Street.
{DIALOGUE}: That's where all the money is.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward looks over at Norther, the reality sinking in.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: I knew then that while my days as a criminal were over, Norther's were just beginning.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The two men wave at each other as Edward drives off.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At the last moment, Norther calls out:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NORTHER WINSLOW

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's talking about his Hand Around the House.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We HOLD ON Norther for a beat, dreaming of his future.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. BLOOM HOUSE [MID/LATE '70'S] - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sandra is watering the garden.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will (5) runs past her to greet Edward, just returned from another trip.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Ten thousand dollars is no fortune to most men.
{DIALOGUE}: But it was enough to buy my wife a proper house with a white picket fence.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We reveal the Bloom house, the nicest one in the neighborhood.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward kisses his wife.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: And for that, it was all the riches a man could ever want.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Another.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then the SPLASHING water goes silent.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward opens one eye.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The other eye.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He sits up to find
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SANDRA
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: sitting on the edge of the tub.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I was drying out.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{DIALOGUE}: I see.
{DIALOGUE}: We need to get you one of those plant misters.
{DIALOGUE}: We can spray you like a fern.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He smiles, then pulls his knees up, making room for her in the tub.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat while she considers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sandra steps out of her sandals and climbs into the tub, facing him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her dress is soaked, but she doesn't mind.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He leans forward and kisses her.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When they separate, she has tears hanging in her eyes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Come now.

{DIALOGUE}: I don't think I'll ever dry out.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY

{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Did you and Dad have any other property?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{META_DATA}: (thinking)
{DIALOGUE}: I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on.
{DIALOGUE}: But we sold that right away.
{DIALOGUE}: Your cousin Shirley bought it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: So you never bought any land.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{DIALOGUE}: Heavens no.
{DIALOGUE}: We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. A LONE HOUSE - DAY

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will notices this.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Reaching the porch, we hear a PIANO playing inside.

{DIALOGUE}: I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.
{META_DATA}: (a beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Like this.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The PIANO STUDENT, a black boy of eight, has stopped.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's watching the conversation at the door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Speaking of awkward...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{META_DATA}: (to the student)
{DIALOGUE}: Listen, Kenny.
{DIALOGUE}: Why don't we skip the lesson today?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: STUDENT
{DIALOGUE}: Do I have to give it back to my Mom?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Not flinching...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Were you and my father having an affair?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{META_DATA}: (taken aback)
{DIALOGUE}: Wow.
{DIALOGUE}: Wow, you just said it.
{DIALOGUE}: I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: I've seen him with women.
{DIALOGUE}: He flirts.
{DIALOGUE}: He always has.
{DIALOGUE}: On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother.
{DIALOGUE}: I just never had proof.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She moves, trying to get out of the corner he's boxed her into.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Once she's finally free...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: Can I ask you a question?
{DIALOGUE}: Why did you come here today?
{DIALOGUE}: If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Because he's dying.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A long beat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jenny is taken back by the suddenness of it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She's a tangle of conflicting emotions.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this.
{DIALOGUE}: You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it.
{DIALOGUE}: Especially this late in the game.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Fair enough.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jenny takes a seat across from him at the table.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: The first thing you have to understand, is that your father never meant to end up here.

{DIALOGUE}: The first time, he was early.
{DIALOGUE}: The second time, he was late.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. EDWARD'S CAR / DRIVING - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's late, and Edward is pensive.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Those days, your father was working for himself.
{DIALOGUE}: If there was one thing you could say about Edward Bloom, it's that he was a social person, and people took a liking to him.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's that loud.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Puts on the handbrake.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just as suddenly, the sound changes -- no longer pounding, but softly SPLASHING.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The world is close and echoing, because --
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. EDWARD'S CAR - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -- the car is underwater.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Water is trickling in through the crack between the window and the door, but very slowly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For now, he's fine.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: That's when he sees her -- The Girl in the River.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She's swimming outside the car.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: While we never see her face exactly, she remains just as beautiful, just as mysterious, as the first time we saw her.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She puts her hand to the windshield.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He puts his up to meet hers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And smiles.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward gathers the clothes that have spilled out of his suitcase, which broke open when he dropped it from
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: HIS CAR,
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: which balances precariously ten feet up in an elm tree.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Edward gathers his last pair of socks, he notices a shiny piece of metal sticking out of the dirt.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's a key.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Fate has a way of circling back on a man, and taking him by surprise.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. ROAD - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Carrying his busted suitcase, a tired Edward walks toward a one-street town in the distance.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We pass a rusty sign...
{META_DATA}: "Welcome to Spectre."
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Amazed and disbelieving, Edward walks down the center of the road, no cars coming from either direction.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks up to find his faded shoes still dangling from the power line, along with the rest of the town's.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: A man sees things differently at different times in his life.
{DIALOGUE}: This town didn't seem the same now that he was older.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. TOWN OF SPECTRE - VARIOUS SHOTS
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We look around the town, on and off Main Street.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There are "FOR SALE" signs in many of the windows
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: A new road had brought the outside world to Spectre, and with it, banks, liens and debt.
{DIALOGUE}: Almost everywhere you looked, people were bankrupt.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. SPECTRE - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We slowly MOVE THROUGH a foreclosure auction to find Edward watching.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Two very corporate MEN IN SUITS, stick out among the bidders.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Two different corporations were looking at buying the town, if they could get the price low enough.
{DIALOGUE}: One wanted to open a chicken processing plant.
{DIALOGUE}: The other, a municipal dump.
{DIALOGUE}: Either way, Spectre would be destroyed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward raises his hand.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Fifty-thousand!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everyone turns to look at this new bidder.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: VARIOUS SHOTS: Expressive and passionate as always, Edward talks to Ping, Jing and Amos Calloway.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Most of them had never seen Spectre -- they only had Edward's words to describe it.
{DIALOGUE}: That's all they needed.
{DIALOGUE}: He sold them on the dream.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JING
{DIALOGUE}: You can structure it as a historical trust.
{DIALOGUE}: But you'll need every contiguous piece of property.
{DIALOGUE}: It's all or nothing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Edward takes notes...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: So first he bought the farms.
{DIALOGUE}: Then he bought the houses.
{DIALOGUE}: Then he bought the stores.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. AL'S COUNTRY - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Finishing up with AL, Edward shakes hands.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Whatever he bought, the people were not asked to leave or pay rent or anything.

{DIALOGUE}: In that way, he could make sure the town would never die.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. ROAD IN THE SWAMP - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward climbs out of his car, the road having literally stopped.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The sun is shining, but it can barely penetrate the trees' thick canopy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Within six months, his trust had purchased the entire town.
{DIALOGUE}: With one exception.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In the distance, he sees a shack, so old it's nearly fallen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He walks toward it, the marshy ground SQUISHING up around his feet, soaking the hems of his trousers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We hear a PIANO playing from inside the shack.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward KNOCKS on the half-hung door, which swings open by itself.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SHACK - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The inside is nicer than you'd think, a real home.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A fire burns in the stove, and curtains hang in the windows.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With her back turned to him, Jenny Hill plays the piano.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward doesn't recognize her as the little girl who used to have a crush on him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Without turning, she says...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: You must be Edward Bloom.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: How did you know?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She keeps PLAYING.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: No one would come out here unless they had business.
{DIALOGUE}: And no one would have business with me except for you.
{DIALOGUE}: You're buying the town.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that.
{DIALOGUE}: You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: So I've heard.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I'll offer you more than it's worth.
{DIALOGUE}: And you know you won't have to move.
{DIALOGUE}: Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jenny stops playing, her piece not quite finished.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She turns to face him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward still doesn't recognize her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: Now let me get this straight.
{DIALOGUE}: You'll buy the swamp from me, but I'll stay in it.
{DIALOGUE}: You'll own the house, but it'll still be mine.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll be here, and you'll come and go as you please to one place or another.
{DIALOGUE}: Do I have that right?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Strange to hear it put that way, but --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: In so many words, yes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom.
{DIALOGUE}: If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: It's not like you're going to lose anything.
{DIALOGUE}: You can ask anyone in town.
{DIALOGUE}: I've been nothing if not generous.
{DIALOGUE}: I want the best for everyone.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A long beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: Mr. Bloom, why are you buying this land?
{DIALOGUE}: Some sort of midlife crisis?
{DIALOGUE}: Instead of buying a convertible, you buy a town?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks at her, puzzled and surprised.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: No one has really asked before.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Helping people makes me happy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not convinced you should be happy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I'm sorry.
{DIALOGUE}: Have I offended you?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She finally turns to face him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY

{DIALOGUE}: I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I see.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT/INT. SWAMP SHACK - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Edward pulls the door shut behind him as he leaves, but it breaks off in his hands.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Lord, I'm sorry I..
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: Please.
{DIALOGUE}: Go.
{DIALOGUE}: Just go.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I'll...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: Go.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She's dead serious.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Weighing the scales of chivalry, he finally backs away.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Turns and heads back towards his car.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We STAY ON Jenny, watching him go.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She's furious, but there's something more in her feelings for him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Something softer.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Most men in that situation would accept their failure and move on.
{DIALOGUE}: But Edward was not like most men.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. SWAMP SHACK ROAD - ANOTHER DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With Karl the Giant's help, Edward unloads a brand new door from a pickup truck.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. SHACK - DAY

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jenny leans against the doorframe listening to his story.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And watching him with deepest affection.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: Of course, the best part was creating new material.
{DIALOGUE}: By the time the twins and I got to Havana, we had a whole new routine worked out for them, with just a ukulele and a harmonica.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Finished with his work, he takes his hat off the chair and hangs it on the rack.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Perfect.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A look between them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With that last job done, there's no reason for him to be staying any longer.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I suppose I should...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes his hat off the rack.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: You can leave it there.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She freezes, stunned and humiliated.

{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: I am in love with my wife.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: I know.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: Lucky girl.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDWARD
{DIALOGUE}: I'm sorry, Jenny.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shoots burst up through the planks in the porch.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Snakes slither through the marsh.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Day becomes night.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: As for the girl, the common belief was that she'd become a witch, and crazy at that.
{DIALOGUE}: She became something of a legend herself.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We REVERSE to find FOUR KIDS looking in through the rusty iron gate with flashlights.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat, then they run away.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: And the story ended where it began.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. JENNY HILL'S KITCHEN - PRESENT DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will and Jenny are still sitting at her table, a pitcher of iced tea between them.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: No, it's logical if you think like your father.
{DIALOGUE}: See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: You didn't become crazy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: Well, therapy.
{DIALOGUE}: And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back.
{DIALOGUE}: I was living in a fairy tale.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will smiles to hear it called that.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: People aren't like they are in stories.
{DIALOGUE}: They hurt each other without meaning to.
{DIALOGUE}: They are kind and unbelievably cruel at the same moment.
{DIALOGUE}: Like me, now.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not sure I should have told you any of this.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her composure is starting to break.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: No, I wanted to know.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm glad I know.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A long beat, both staring at their iced tea.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: I wanted to meet you for the longest time.
{DIALOGUE}: I did.
{META_DATA}: (a smile)
{DIALOGUE}: I envied you so much.
{DIALOGUE}: The way Eddie would talk about you when you were at Missouri, that award you won.
{DIALOGUE}: Congratulations, incidentally.
{DIALOGUE}: And when you got the job at the A.P., everything, he was so proud of you.
{DIALOGUE}: I mean, that's the thing.
{DIALOGUE}: Every moment he loved you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She's fighting tears, not the first ones she's shed over this.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JENNY
{DIALOGUE}: And as brightly as the sun would shine when he was with me, every time he left it disappeared.
{DIALOGUE}: I wanted to be as important to him as you were, and I was never going to be.
{DIALOGUE}: I was make-believe and his other life, you, were real.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ANGLE ON Will, sorting through his swirling thoughts.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. GUEST ROOM - DUSK
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Looking over his shoulder, we see his father's bed is empty.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The sheets are in a tangle on the floor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat, then Will half-runs back down the hall.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Back down the stairs.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. FOYER - DUSK
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Headed out, Will grabs his keys off the table.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We LOOK RIGHT, where the "MESSAGE" light blinks on the answering machine.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The hospital is so new, it's not even finished -- thick plastic hangs from exposed framing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There's no one at the information desk, so Will forges ahead.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will reads a directory board, trying to decide the best place to start.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, behind him --

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns to see his wife at a payphone.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She hangs up.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Is he going to be okay?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: How can she answer?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He half-smiles, realizing the idiocy of his question.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Of course his father's not going to be okay.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: What I mean is, will he get back to the way he was when...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She cuts him off --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPHINE
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: He won't.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm sorry.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And like that, it's done.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPHINE
{DIALOGUE}: I'm sorry.

{DIALOGUE}: Like clockwork.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The two women start to walk, no hurry.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{DIALOGUE}: Do you like it, being pregnant?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPHINE
{DIALOGUE}: I do.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SANDRA
{DIALOGUE}: I loved it.
{DIALOGUE}: It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it.
{DIALOGUE}: I did.
{DIALOGUE}: Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sandra has accidentally evoked a storm of emotion.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She struggles to keep it in check.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Almost a whisper...

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A KNOCK as Dr. Bennett enters with his overcoat and bag, ready to leave for the night.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. BENNETT
{DIALOGUE}: Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk.

{DIALOGUE}: My father and I have an advantage.
{DIALOGUE}: We never talk.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dr. Bennett smiles as he checks Edward's chart.

{DIALOGUE}: Not that one.

{DIALOGUE}: Did he ever tell you that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{META_DATA}: (suddenly interested)
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. BENNETT
{DIALOGUE}: Your mother came in about three in the afternoon.
{DIALOGUE}: Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita.
{DIALOGUE}: You were born a week early, but there were no complications.
{DIALOGUE}: It was a perfect delivery.
{DIALOGUE}: Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can't see as it would have been much different had he been there.
{DIALOGUE}: And that's the real story of how you were born.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A long silence, just the sounds of the hospital, doctors being paged.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. BENNETT
{DIALOGUE}: Not very exciting, is it?
{DIALOGUE}: And I suppose if I had to choose between the true version and an elaborate one involving a fish and a wedding ring, I might choose the fancy version.
{DIALOGUE}: But that's just me.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will half-smiles.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Patting Will's shoulder, Dr. Bennett leaves.
