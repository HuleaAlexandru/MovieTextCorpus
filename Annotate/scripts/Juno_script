{CHARACTER_NAME}: PUNK RECEPTIONIST
{DIALOGUE}: Would you like some free condoms?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO

{DIALOGUE}: What are you doing here, dumbass?
{DIALOGUE}: I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: I couldn't do it, Leah!
{DIALOGUE}: It smelled like a dentist in there.
{DIALOGUE}: They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub.
{DIALOGUE}: And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails.
{DIALOGUE}: Fingernails!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEAH
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, gruesome.
{DIALOGUE}: I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: I'm staying pregnant, Le.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEAH
{DIALOGUE}: Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere.
{DIALOGUE}: She doesn't know we're sexually active.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: What does that even mean?
{DIALOGUE}: Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over.
{DIALOGUE}: I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing.
{DIALOGUE}: You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something.
{DIALOGUE}: Or some nice lesbos.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEAH
{DIALOGUE}: But then you'll get huge.
{DIALOGUE}: Your chest is going to milktate.
{DIALOGUE}: And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: I know.
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEAH
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leah sighs, as if there's no helping her nerdy friend.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEAH
{DIALOGUE}: Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads.
{DIALOGUE}: I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: There are ads?
{DIALOGUE}: For parents?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEAH
{DIALOGUE}: Oh yeah!
{DIALOGUE}: "Desperately Seeking Spawn."
{DIALOGUE}: They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment.
{DIALOGUE}: It's totally legit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Come on, Leah.
{DIALOGUE}: I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver!
{DIALOGUE}: That's tacky.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{META_DATA}: (reading a different page)
{DIALOGUE}: There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano.
{DIALOGUE}: Free for the hauling!
{DIALOGUE}: We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEAH
{DIALOGUE}: You're not listening to me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: No, I heard you.
{DIALOGUE}: I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome."
{DIALOGUE}: I'm looking for something a little edgier.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEAH
{DIALOGUE}: What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass.
{DIALOGUE}: But I'm trying to not be too particular.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEAH
{DIALOGUE}: All right, how about this one?
{DIALOGUE}: "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five.
{DIALOGUE}: You will be compensated.
{DIALOGUE}: Help us complete the circle of love."
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Yeesh, they sound like a cult.
{DIALOGUE}: Besides, they're greedy bitches.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLEEKER'S MOM

{DIALOGUE}: Patties, not linkies, just like you like it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bleeker places his hand silently on his stomach.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLEEKER'S MOM

{DIALOGUE}: She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLEEKER
{DIALOGUE}: Thanks for the message.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLEEKER'S MOM
{DIALOGUE}: You know how I feel about her.

{DIALOGUE}: Hon, did you get expelled?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BREN
{DIALOGUE}: Well, I was just asking.
{DIALOGUE}: It seemed plausible.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAC
{DIALOGUE}: Do you need a large sum of money?
{DIALOGUE}: Legal counsel?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything.
{DIALOGUE}: Except maybe mercy.
{DIALOGUE}: Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAC
{DIALOGUE}: What have you done, Junebug?
{DIALOGUE}: Did you hit someone with the Previa?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEAH
{DIALOGUE}: Best to just tell them, man.
{DIALOGUE}: Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: I'm pregnant.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bren and Mac are predictably speechless.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAC
{DIALOGUE}: You're pregnant?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: I'm so sorry, you guys.
{DIALOGUE}: If it's any consolation, I have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday.
{DIALOGUE}: Morning!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BREN
{META_DATA}: (interrupting)
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't even know you were sexually active!

{DIALOGUE}: I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BREN
{DIALOGUE}: Nails?
{DIALOGUE}: Really?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAC
{DIALOGUE}: No, I mean the father!
{DIALOGUE}: Who's the father, Juno?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Oh.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bren and Mac burst into shocked laughter.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: What?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAC
{DIALOGUE}: Paulie Bleeker?
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't know he had it in him!

{META_DATA}: (giggling)
{DIALOGUE}: He just doesn't look, well, virile.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEAH
{DIALOGUE}: I know, right?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAC
{DIALOGUE}: Okay, this is no laughing matter.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{META_DATA}: (indignant)
{DIALOGUE}: No, it's not.
{DIALOGUE}: Paulie is virile, by the way.
{DIALOGUE}: He was very good in... chair.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leah fires a be quiet glance at Juno.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAC
{DIALOGUE}: Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEAH
{DIALOGUE}: We found them in the Penny Saver by the exotic birds section.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bren looks understandably alarmed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Juno hastily attempts to make the situation sound more legitimate.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: But they have a real lawyer and everything.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm going to meet with them next weekend.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BREN
{DIALOGUE}: Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do.
{DIALOGUE}: Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Well, I'm not ready to be a mom.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAC
{DIALOGUE}: Damn skippy, you're not!
{DIALOGUE}: You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Once!
{DIALOGUE}: And she didn't die, if you recall!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BREN
{DIALOGUE}: Honey, had you considered, you know, the alternative?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leah and Juno exchange glances.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BREN
{DIALOGUE}: Well, you're a brave young lady.
{DIALOGUE}: You're made of stronger stuff than I thought.
{DIALOGUE}: You're a little Viking!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Cool it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BREN
{DIALOGUE}: First things first, we have to get you healthy.
{DIALOGUE}: You need prenatal vitamins.
{DIALOGUE}: Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus.
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment.
{DIALOGUE}: Find out where you're going to deliver.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: The term "deliver" is so weird.
{DIALOGUE}: Can we not say "deliver"?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEAH
{DIALOGUE}: How does "crap it out" sound?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAC
{DIALOGUE}: Juno, I want to come with you to meet these adoption people.
{DIALOGUE}: You're just a kid.
{DIALOGUE}: I don't want you to get ripped off by a couple of babystarved wingnuts.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Sure, Dad.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mac nods, satisfied, then contemplates the situation dismally.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAC
{DIALOGUE}: I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BREN
{META_DATA}: (sensing tension)
{DIALOGUE}: Why don't you girls go upstairs for a while?
{DIALOGUE}: I think Mac's gonna blow.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Juno and Leah hightail it upstairs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAC
{DIALOGUE}: Just tell it to me straight, Bren.
{DIALOGUE}: Do you think this is my fault?
{DIALOGUE}: Her mother's fault?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BREN
{DIALOGUE}: I think kids get bored and have intercourse.
{DIALOGUE}: And I think Junebug was a dummy about it.
{DIALOGUE}: But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAC
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BREN
{DIALOGUE}: You're not going to be a Pop-Pop.
{DIALOGUE}: And Juno's not going to be a ma.
{DIALOGUE}: Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation.
{DIALOGUE}: I friggin' hope.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAC
{META_DATA}: (conspiratorially)
{DIALOGUE}: Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BREN
{DIALOGUE}: Oh God yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAC
{DIALOGUE}: That was my first instinct too.
{DIALOGUE}: Or D.W.I. Anything but this.
{DIALOGUE}: And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BREN
{DIALOGUE}: Oh Mac, no!
{DIALOGUE}: He's a sweet kid.

{DIALOGUE}: The tough part's almost over for you.
{DIALOGUE}: I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, but I hardly noticed it.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO

{CHARACTER_NAME}: GERTA
{DIALOGUE}: Mark and Vanessa are willing to negotiate an open adoption.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAC
{META_DATA}: (protective)
{DIALOGUE}: Wait.
{DIALOGUE}: What does that mean?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GERTA
{DIALOGUE}: It means they'd send annual updates, photos, let Juno know how the baby is doing as he or she grows up.
{DIALOGUE}: Of course, Juno's legal rights would be terminated...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Whoah.
{DIALOGUE}: I don't want to see pictures.
{DIALOGUE}: I don't need to be notified of anything.
{DIALOGUE}: Can't we just kick it old school?
{DIALOGUE}: I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way.
{DIALOGUE}: You know, like Moses in the reeds.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mark and Juno lock eyes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah!
{DIALOGUE}: The way people used to do it.
{DIALOGUE}: Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GERTA
{DIALOGUE}: Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Shit, yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: Close it up.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Vanessa is clearly ecstatic.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.

{DIALOGUE}: Excuse me?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby.

{META_DATA}: (aghast)
{DIALOGUE}: Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?

{DIALOGUE}: Why are you going up there in the first place?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: They said they wanted to know about this stuff.
{DIALOGUE}: They said to keep them updated, so I did!

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know, I just did.

{DIALOGUE}: Besides, who cares if he's married?
{DIALOGUE}: I can have friends who are married.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BREN

{DIALOGUE}: I wish my funbags would get bigger.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Trust me, you don't.
{DIALOGUE}: I actually have to wear a bra now.
{DIALOGUE}: And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.

{DIALOGUE}: I don't have a choice.
{DIALOGUE}: Keith's been grading me really hard lately.

{DIALOGUE}: Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Katrina?
{DIALOGUE}: Pfft, no way.
{DIALOGUE}: He doesn't like Katrina.
{DIALOGUE}: It must be a pity date.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEAH
{META_DATA}: (shrugging)
{DIALOGUE}: He asked her.
{DIALOGUE}: I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEAH
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, it totally does.
{DIALOGUE}: I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing.
{DIALOGUE}: But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEAH
{DIALOGUE}: I wouldn't be so sure about that.
{DIALOGUE}: He did it with you.
{DIALOGUE}: He's a man now.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me.
{DIALOGUE}: We're best friends.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEAH
{DIALOGUE}: Are you jealous?
{DIALOGUE}: I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not jealous, and I don't care.
{DIALOGUE}: I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that.
{DIALOGUE}: She seems so nice and all.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEAH
{DIALOGUE}: Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Prom is for wenises, anyway.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLEEKER
{META_DATA}: (meekly)

{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLEEKER
{DIALOGUE}: You're mad.
{DIALOGUE}: Why are you mad?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not mad.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm in a fucking great mood.
{DIALOGUE}: Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLEEKER
{DIALOGUE}: Katrina's not my girlfriend!
{DIALOGUE}: And I doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye.
{DIALOGUE}: She just looks like that all the time.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A GIRL strides past (obviously KATRINA) with a sour look aimed squarely at Juno.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Whatever.
{DIALOGUE}: Have fun at the prom with Soupy Sales.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm sure I can think of something way more cool to do that night.
{DIALOGUE}: Like I could pumice my feet, or go to Bren's dumb Unitarian church, or get hit by a ten-ton truck full of hot garbage juice.
{DIALOGUE}: All those things would be exponentially cooler than going to the prom with you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She starts to walk away.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bleeker takes a deep breath.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLEEKER
{DIALOGUE}: You're being really immature.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{META_DATA}: (turning around)
{DIALOGUE}: What?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bleeker BRACES himself and pushes up his lab goggles.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: That's not how our thing works!
{DIALOGUE}: I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLEEKER
{DIALOGUE}: Not this time.
{DIALOGUE}: You don't have any reason to be mad at me.
{DIALOGUE}: You broke my heart.
{DIALOGUE}: I should be royally ticked at you, man.
{DIALOGUE}: I should be really cheesed off.
{DIALOGUE}: I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Why?
{DIALOGUE}: Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLEEKER
{DIALOGUE}: Like I'd marry you!
{DIALOGUE}: You would be the meanest wife of all time.
{DIALOGUE}: And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV.
{DIALOGUE}: The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead.
{DIALOGUE}: La la la."
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Forget it, Bleek.
{DIALOGUE}: Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLEEKER
{META_DATA}: (searching for a comeback)
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO

{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLEEKER
{META_DATA}: (looking around, panicked)
{DIALOGUE}: Oh my God, SHUT UP!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: What?
{DIALOGUE}: Are you ashamed that we did it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLEEKER
{DIALOGUE}: No...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Well at least you don't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm a planet!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Juno picks up her BACKPACK dejectedly and slides it over her shoulder.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She's about to walk away, when...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLEEKER
{DIALOGUE}: Wait, let me take that.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Huh?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLEEKER
{DIALOGUE}: You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll take it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Oh.
{DIALOGUE}: It's fine.
{DIALOGUE}: What's another ten pounds?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She turns around, wipes TEARS off her cheek (making sure no one sees) and continues down the hallway.

{DIALOGUE}: It's beautiful!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Juno kneels down and pops in one of the discs.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mark Laughs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: What?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: I actually know this one.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{META_DATA}: (growing)
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: No?

{DIALOGUE}: That's a big, fat sack of no!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: What's the matter?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: This isn't what we agreed on.
{DIALOGUE}: You guys have to take care of... this!
{DIALOGUE}: You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She GESTURES wildly to her belly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, something matters to her far more than the approval of an older guy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: But I thought you'd be cool if...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{META_DATA}: (interrupting)
{DIALOGUE}: I want you guys to adopt the Buglet.
{DIALOGUE}: I wanted everything to be perfect.
{DIALOGUE}: Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family.
{DIALOGUE}: Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right.
{DIALOGUE}: Believe me on this one!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: A baby is not going to fix everything.
{DIALOGUE}: Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{META_DATA}: (aghast)
{DIALOGUE}: But you're old!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: I..

{DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{DIALOGUE}: I just liked being your friend.
{DIALOGUE}: I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: This... (he gestures to the dank surrounding room) ...this is what my life has become.
{DIALOGUE}: Stuff in boxes.
{DIALOGUE}: Stuff underground.
{DIALOGUE}: Is that so appealing to you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault?
{DIALOGUE}: Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: That's not the point.
{DIALOGUE}: We're just not in love anymore.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her?
{DIALOGUE}: If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it.
{DIALOGUE}: My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times.
{DIALOGUE}: You're just not trying.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mark suddenly sees Juno for what she is -- a teenage girl.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: VANESSA
{META_DATA}: (you've been thinking?)

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She knows exactly to what he's referring.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Juno's face continues to fall.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Vanessa notices.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VANESSA
{META_DATA}: (to Juno)
{DIALOGUE}: Juno, don't worry about this.
{DIALOGUE}: He just has cold feet.
{DIALOGUE}: That's how boys are.
{DIALOGUE}: The books all say the same thing.
{DIALOGUE}: A woman becomes a mother when she gets pregnant.
{DIALOGUE}: A man becomes a father when he sees his baby.
{DIALOGUE}: He's going to get there.
{DIALOGUE}: He'll get there.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Juno ain't buying it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VANESSA
{META_DATA}: (to Mark)
{DIALOGUE}: Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: It all just happened so fast.

{DIALOGUE}: I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VANESSA
{META_DATA}: (quietly)
{DIALOGUE}: She answered our prayers.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{META_DATA}: (ignores the comment)
{DIALOGUE}: Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Juno looks offended.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VANESSA
{DIALOGUE}: What are you saying?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A long hideous beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: It just feels a little like bad timing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Another hideous beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VANESSA
{DIALOGUE}: What would be a good time for you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{DIALOGUE}: There's just things I still want to do.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VANESSA
{DIALOGUE}: Like what?
{DIALOGUE}: Be a rock star?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: Don't mock me.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Vanessa sighs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's done.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VANESSA
{DIALOGUE}: You're trying to do something that's never going to happen.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Juno nods in agreement.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAC
{DIALOGUE}: In my opinion, the best thing you can do is to find a person who loves you for exactly what you are.

{DIALOGUE}: That was me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLEEKER
{DIALOGUE}: Why?

{DIALOGUE}: Mine too.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BLEEKER
{DIALOGUE}: Well, yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JUNO
{DIALOGUE}: You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse?
