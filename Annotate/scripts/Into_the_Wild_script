{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WIDE-SHOT: A vast, snow-blanketed wilderness that sits beneath the icy summits of the highest mountain range in North America.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is BIG Alaska.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat up 4x4 pick-up enters very small into the upper left corner of frame on an unkept, snow-packed road, and comes to a stop.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A figure exits the passenger side and moves around the front of the truck.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We can just make out the rifle sticking out of his backpack.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We HEAR a very distant "Thank You" as the figure walks away from the road and away from the truck, seemingly into nowhere.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DRIVER
{DIALOGUE}: Hey!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The figure with backpack and rifle, henceforth BACKPACK, stopping in his tracks, turns around in the direction of the truck.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is a pause as Backpack considers accepting the boots.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DRIVER (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: If you make it out alive, give me a call, and I'll tell you how to get the boots back to me.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We can feel over Backpack's shoulder that he has taken the boots and is putting them on but we STAY on the driver.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BACKPACK
{DIALOGUE}: Hey, do me a favor, will ya?
{DIALOGUE}: Take a picture of me.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Backpack hands him an Instamatic camera and starts walking backwards.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Backpack exits the frame, we SLOWLY ZOOM past the concerned face of the driver onto the loose change, the comb, and the watch on the dash.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 3.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Throughout the ZOOM, the SOUND of FOOTSTEPS CRUNCHING THE SNOW, FADE into the distance.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: BACK TO:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ORIGINAL WIDE-SHOT:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see the small form of the truck and the smaller form of the Backpacker walking away from the truck until the Backpacker has exited the frame.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The truck takes a BEAT, turns around in the snow, and accelerates back into the direction from which it came.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Their bright young faces, capped heads, and gowns, glide up to the podium to accept their diplomas.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INTERCUT: Chris, on his run, sweatshirt hood over head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Amongst assembled crowd and family we find: THE MCCANDLESS': BILLIE, mid to late forties with dark striking eyes; WALT, a taciturn man, early fifties; and CARINE, eighteen, pretty with her mother's eyes and waist length brown hair, a gold crucifix dangles from her neck.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They look around, looking for Chris, he's nowhere in sight.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INTERCUT: Chris, in a shower (PHOTO-SONICS) He TURNS INTO CAMERA, the water streaming down his face.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: From the announcement podium comes the name of their son and brother, CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The McCandless family increasingly panicked over Chris' absence, when almost magically, he appears in full cap and gown.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 4.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Disregarding the steps that lead up to the podium platform, the small-framed but athletic CHRIS MCCANDLESS leaps jubilantly onto the stage in a single bound, frightening Billie, a little wince from Walt, and Carine "That's our Chris."
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And just as quickly as Chris has been handed his diploma, he civilly descends the platform steps.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: TIME CUT:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SLO-MO: A ballet of graduation caps float upward into a frame of blue sky.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We HEAR Chris' voice OVER this image as we intermittently cut away from the caps against the sky to focus on his parents.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An outer glee in sharp contrast to voice over:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRIS (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: I see them standing at the formal gates of their colleges, I see my father strolling out under the ochre sandstone arch, the red tiles glinting like bent plates of blood behind his head, I see my mother with a few light books at her hip standing at the pillar made of tiny bricks with the wrought-iron gate still open behind her, its sword-tips black in the May air, they are about to graduate, they are about to get married, they are kids, they are dumb, all they know is they are innocent, they would never hurt anybody.
{DIALOGUE}: I want to go up to them and say Stop, don't do it--she's the wrong woman, he's the wrong man, you are going to do things you cannot imagine you would ever do, you are going to do bad things to children, you are going to suffer in ways you never heard of, you are going to want to die.
{DIALOGUE}: I want to go up to them there in the late May sunlight and say it, her hungry pretty blank face turning to me,

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We TILT DOWN a stack of books sitting on the floor - Tolstoy, Stegner, Thoreau, Jack London, and Pasternak.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beside them, a camper's backpack.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chris sits in introspection at his desk by candlelight.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The room is spare, supporting his monkish lifestyle.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But on the desk before him, he counts out $500.68 from a bank envelope.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pockets those bills and change, then removes a check for $24,000 made out to OXFAM America from the same bank envelope.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He scribbles a note: These are all my savings.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Feed someone with it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Signed, Chris McCandless.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pulls his wallet from his back pocket.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Pulls all the cards and pictures from its sleeves.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Considering each, he flicks them into a trash bin, one by one.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Finally coming to his social security card, he holds it to the candles flame.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It rapidly builds into an alarming ROAR.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The roar grows to a deafening level.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chris awakens.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 11.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he peeks up from the backseat looking forward through the windshield, he just barely catches sight of the leading edge of a flash flood.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A four-foot high wall of water, mud and debris makes impact with the Datsun, momentarily enveloping it in water.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly the car is SLAMMED against the cliff.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CRACK!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chris sits upright, disoriented.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: POV: As far as the eye can see in the desert moonlight, water has taken over the desert with a flash flood.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: However, there's no panic in Chris' face as we observe him past a new crack in the wet windshield.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The water, while violent seems to have topped off just above the wheels.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chris gets a slight smile on his face, as the car settles into its new position below the cliff.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He returns to sleep.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 13 EXT. DESERT - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: What remains of Chris' travelling money burns in a pile beside the Datsun on the sun-lit but muddy desert floor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We follow a very long set of footprints (CAMERA TRACKING/TRUE VERTICAL) away from the burning cash through the mud, finally tilting up to the footprint maker, Chris.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Slogging toward high ground.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WIDE-SHOT: We see the abandoned Datsun nearly a mile behind Chris as he walks toward us wearing his backpack.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He comes very close to camera (only a day or two's stubble on his face) and as we PAN him 180, we see as much wilderness before us as we did behind.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRIS
{DIALOGUE}: This is Emory University freshman Chris McCandless reporting from the vault at Thompson Hall.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He indicates a hatchway in the floor leading to a brightly lit corridor below.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRIS (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: We have just dynamited the hatchway and are the first human beings to step foot into this vault in over a hundred years.
{DIALOGUE}: Somewhere in here lies the secret of the great beast within us all.
{DIALOGUE}: A beast built on lies, corruption, and greed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We HEAR a GROWLING SOUND from behind Chris.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRIS (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: And there it is!
{DIALOGUE}: The legendary beast Mocra.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CAMERA quickly PANS to a blanket-wrapped, crawling FELLOW STUDENT in a grotesque Halloween mask.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We MOVE INTO CU on the monster growling.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: QUICK PAN back to Chris.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRIS (CONT'D)
{META_DATA}: (in mock fright)
{DIALOGUE}: We've got to get out of here quick and re- secure the hatch while we make a plan of how to kill the beast.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CAMERA SHAKES all over like a bad horror film trying to stay with Chris as he makes a quick escape down the hatchway into the University dorm corridor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLUMSY VIDEO TIME CUT: Chris nailing the last nail in the hatchway from below.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He climbs down the steps where he exchanges his hammer for his microphone from an off- camera source.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRIS (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: Well, it looks like we've succeeded -
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We HEAR the monster's GROWL from above.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 13.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRIS (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: - at least for the moment, in sealing the beast back into the vault.
{DIALOGUE}: Your humble reporter, Chris McCandless will now struggle with the journalistic question of ethics: Will he retain his reporter's objectiveness or save the future of human truth by slaying this awful beast?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He gives us a look of vaudevillian puzzlement - what will he do?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CONTINUE VIDEO:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We pick up with Chris in a corridor outside a door with a cheap paper-and-tape label announcing the adjacent room as the office of Ted Turner.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRIS (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: Once again, your humble reporter Chris McCandless.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We HEAR OS students commenting on Chris and his video crew:

{DIALOGUE}: What is this?
{DIALOGUE}: Filmmaking 101?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OS STUDENT #2
{DIALOGUE}: Point the camera at me.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm a star.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 15 INT. WOULD-BE TED TURNER OFFICE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A FELLOW STUDENT PLAYING TED TURNER with obvious fake mustache is locked into an episode of Matlock on his television set as our bold reporter, Chris, barges in.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRIS
{DIALOGUE}: Ted!
{DIALOGUE}: We've got a monster in the vault.
{DIALOGUE}: It represents all the corruption, the deceit, and greed within us all.
{DIALOGUE}: I must slay it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 14.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TED TURNER/STUDENT
{META_DATA}: (worst acting we've ever seen)
{DIALOGUE}: McCandless, how many times have I had to tell you?
{DIALOGUE}: I've had to tell you that you are a journalist and you can't get personally involved in your cases...or your stories.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRIS
{DIALOGUE}: Ted!
{DIALOGUE}: I know how to kill it.
{DIALOGUE}: And I'm the only one who knows.
{DIALOGUE}: You can't keep sending me on stories and expecting me to do nothing!
{DIALOGUE}: I look like some kind of an idiot.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TED TURNER/STUDENT
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know who you're talking to?
{DIALOGUE}: I'm Ted Turner.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Behind Chris in the corridor outside Ted's office, a PANICKED STUDENT arrives at the door.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PANICKED STUDENT
{DIALOGUE}: McCandless!
{DIALOGUE}: You've got to hurry!
{DIALOGUE}: The monster is scratching at the hatchway.
{DIALOGUE}: He'll be out in no time.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TED TURNER/STUDENT
{META_DATA}: (threatening)
{DIALOGUE}: It'll mean your job, Chris McCandless.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRIS
{META_DATA}: (to Ted)
{DIALOGUE}: That's it, Ted.
{DIALOGUE}: Fire me if you want but this beast must be slayed.
{DIALOGUE}: Microphone in hand, Chris makes haste.
{DIALOGUE}: The CAMERA RUNS WITH HIM out the door, through the corridor, up a set of steps to the hatchway.
{DIALOGUE}: As he arrives, the monster appears above him in the hatchway crawl space having pulled off the board Chris had nailed.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRIS (CONT'D)
{META_DATA}: (into camera)
{DIALOGUE}: This is the only thing that can kill the monster.
{DIALOGUE}: It's gonna be risky but without great risk, there is no freedom.
{DIALOGUE}: So we will now hear from the famous singer - Chris McCandless.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 15.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A piano is PUSHED INTO FRAME beside Chris.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A YOUNG BLACK STUDENT pulls a stool in front of the piano and begins to play.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chris begins to serenade the monster, intermittently sharing the serenade directly into camera as well.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He bursts into an uninhibited solo of Tender Is The Night.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CAMERA TILTS UP to the monster looking out the hatchway, slowly dying from the song being sung.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the song continues to be sung and the monster continues to die, the AUDIO RECEDES and VIDEO IMAGES GO TO SLO MO.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CARINE (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: When we were little, Chris was very to himself.
{DIALOGUE}: He wasn't anti-social, he always had friends, and everybody liked him - but he could go off and entertain himself for hours, he didn't seem to need toys or friends.
{DIALOGUE}: He could be alone without being lonely.
{DIALOGUE}: The secrets our parents kept, though unknown to Chris and I, led to bouts of rage and even violence between them that we had been forced to witness since we were very young.
{DIALOGUE}: It seemed like they never fought without us.
{DIALOGUE}: I remember the first family meeting to let Chris and me in on their plans for getting a divorce.
{DIALOGUE}: They wanted us to choose which of them we'd live with.
{DIALOGUE}: I cried my eyes out.
{DIALOGUE}: But the divorce never happened, though the threats and meetings never stopped.
{DIALOGUE}: It wasn't long before Chris and I shut off -- we would tell mom and dad to go ahead and get the divorce.
{DIALOGUE}: Chris and I just wanted to get away from their fights and mom kept promising to get out and take us with her as soon as their company made enough money.
{DIALOGUE}: Dad had been the young genius [that] NASA enlisted to do [crucial] designs for the American satellite radar systems that would be our answer to the Russian Sputnik.
{DIALOGUE}: And mom and he later started up a consulting firm combining her get-up- and-go resourcefulness with his wealth of knowledge.
{DIALOGUE}: By the time the company actually made its first million, the careerism and money seemed to erase her memory of the promise she'd made us.
{META_DATA}: (MORE)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 16.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: I think this is when Chris began to see "careers" as a diseased invention of the twentieth century and to resent money and the useless priority people made of it in their lives.
{DIALOGUE}: He'd begun planning to "slay the beast"...to make himself free.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She pushes the stringy hairs from his eyes, worries when he descends below the surface for too many seconds, and smiles and laughs in tender relief when from below surface one of her toes is pulled on by the big fish Chris.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: CARINE (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: In early September, mom and dad got a call from the Annandale police notifying them that Chris' abandoned car had been identified by the Arizona Highway Patrol after a group of rare flower hunters stumbled upon it in the desert.
{DIALOGUE}: There were no signs that Chris had intended to return to it.
{DIALOGUE}: But there wasn't any evidence of struggle.
{DIALOGUE}: The police said they thought Chris had chosen to leave it behind and not that it had been taken from him.
{DIALOGUE}: Nonetheless, the initial comfort that gave mom and dad, quickly turned to their realization that Chris was actually trying not to be found.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 50 EXT. ANNANDALE STREET - DUSK
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see Walt.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He walks out the door of his house into the street.

{DIALOGUE}: So, in return, I've been busting my ass a bit...at Domino's Pizza -

{CHARACTER_NAME}: CARINE (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: The day after the party, Chris left on his trip and ended up staying away most of the summer.
{DIALOGUE}: It was nearly three months before he walked back into our house in Annandale.
{DIALOGUE}: He had a scruffy beard, his hair was long and tangled, and he was rail thin.
{DIALOGUE}: As soon as I heard he was home, I ran into his room to talk to him.
{DIALOGUE}: In California, he'd looked up some old family friends who still lived there.
{DIALOGUE}: He'd found out that long after he had been born, our dad had continued a relationship with his first wife Marcia in secret.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 53 EXT CUT BANK, MONTANA - SUNSET
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: BRIEF CUTAWAY to Chris hitching on the Montana highway.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CARINE
{DIALOGUE}: And that one lie had led to another.
{DIALOGUE}: That two years after Chris was born, dad had had another son with Marcia.
{DIALOGUE}: Worse yet was that it was Marcia to whom he was still legally married at the time.
{DIALOGUE}: And it was Chris and I who were the bastard children.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: BACK TO:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 54 EXT ANNANDALE STREET - DUSK
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Walt.

{META_DATA}: (MORE)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 39A.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CARINE (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: Chris was quiet when he told me this.
{DIALOGUE}: He said it made his "entire childhood seem like a fiction"; that "the truth had been dying everyday."
{DIALOGUE}: If something bothered Chris, he'd usually keep it to himself.
{DIALOGUE}: And he made me promise to do the same.
{META_DATA}: (MORE)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 40.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CARINE (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: He never did tell mom and dad that he knew.
{DIALOGUE}: But Chris measured himself and those around him by an impossibly rigorous moral code.
{DIALOGUE}: He loathed what he considered mom and dad's hypocrisy and resented what they considered guidance.
{DIALOGUE}: Chris submitted to dad's authority through college but I knew he raged inwardly the whole time.
{DIALOGUE}: It was inevitable that Chris would rebel.
{DIALOGUE}: And when he did, he did it with characteristic immoderation.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Walt suddenly collapses to his knees weeping, heartbroken and ashamed on a quiet Annandale street in the shadowless light of dusk.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
