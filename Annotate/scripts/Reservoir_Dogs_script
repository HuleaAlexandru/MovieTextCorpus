{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 1 INT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - MORNING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Eight men dressed in BLACK SUITS, sit around a table at a breakfast cafe.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are MR. WHITE, MR. PINK, MR. BLUE, MR. BLONDE, MR. ORANGE, MR. BROWN, NICE GUY EDDIE CABOT, and the big boss, JOE CABOT.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Most are finished eating and are enjoying coffee and conversation.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Joe flips through a small address book.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mr. Pink is telling a long and involved story about Madonna.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: "Like a Virgin" is all about a girl who digs a guy with a big dick.
{DIALOGUE}: The whole song is a metaphor for big dicks.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. BLUE
{DIALOGUE}: No it's not.
{DIALOGUE}: It's about a girl who is very vulnerable and she's been fucked over a few times.
{DIALOGUE}: Then she meets some guy who's really sensitive--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: --Whoa...whoa...time out Greenbay.
{DIALOGUE}: Tell that bullshit to the tourists.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOE
{META_DATA}: (looking through his address book)
{DIALOGUE}: Toby...who the fuck is Toby?
{DIALOGUE}: Toby...Toby...think...think... think...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy.
{DIALOGUE}: Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. ORANGE
{DIALOGUE}: Which one is "True Blue?"
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NICE GUY EDDIE
{DIALOGUE}: You don't remember "True Blue?"
{DIALOGUE}: That was a big ass hit for Madonna.
{DIALOGUE}: Shit, I don't even follow this Tops In Pops shit, and I've at least heard of "True Blue."
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. ORANGE
{DIALOGUE}: Look, asshole, I didn't say I ain't heard of it.
{DIALOGUE}: All I asked was how does it go?
{DIALOGUE}: Excuse me for not being the world's biggest Madonna fan.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. BROWN
{DIALOGUE}: I hate Madonna.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. BLUE
{DIALOGUE}: I like her early stuff.
{DIALOGUE}: You know, "Lucky Star," "Borderline" - but once she got into her "Papa Don't Preach" phase, I don't know, I tuned out.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here.
{DIALOGUE}: You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOE
{DIALOGUE}: Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: What's that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOE
{DIALOGUE}: I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age.
{DIALOGUE}: Toby what?
{DIALOGUE}: What the fuck was her last name?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: Where was I?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. ORANGE
{DIALOGUE}: You said "True Blue" was about a nice girl who finds a sensitive fella.
{DIALOGUE}: But "Like a Virgin" was a metaphor for big dicks.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: Let me tell ya what "Like a Virgin"'s about.
{DIALOGUE}: It's about some cooze who's a regular fuck machine.
{DIALOGUE}: I mean all the time, morning, day, night, afternoon, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. BLUE
{DIALOGUE}: How many dicks was that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: A lot.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby.
{DIALOGUE}: This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape."
{DIALOGUE}: He's diggin tunnels.
{DIALOGUE}: Now she's gettin this serious dick action, she's feelin something she ain't felt since forever.
{DIALOGUE}: Pain.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOE
{DIALOGUE}: Chew?
{DIALOGUE}: Toby Chew?
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: It hurts.
{DIALOGUE}: It hurts her.
{DIALOGUE}: It shouldn't hurt.
{DIALOGUE}: Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now.
{DIALOGUE}: But when this cat fucks her, it hurts.
{DIALOGUE}: It hurts like the first time.
{DIALOGUE}: The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin.
{DIALOGUE}: Hence, "Like a Virgin."
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The fellas crack up.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOE
{DIALOGUE}: Wong?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: Fuck you, wrong.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm right!
{DIALOGUE}: What the fuck do you know about it anyway?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOE
{DIALOGUE}: Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong!
{DIALOGUE}: You know, like the Chinese name?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mr. White snatches the address book from Joe's hand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They fight, but they're not really mad at each other.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: Give me this fucking thing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOE
{DIALOGUE}: What the fuck do you think you're doin?
{DIALOGUE}: Give me my book back!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: I'm sick of fuckin hearin it Joe, I'll give it back when we leave.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOE
{DIALOGUE}: Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names.
{DIALOGUE}: "Toby...Toby...Toby... Toby Wong...Toby Wong...Toby Chung...fuckin Charlie Chan."
{DIALOGUE}: I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't- know-what, outta my left.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOE
{DIALOGUE}: What do you care?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOE
{DIALOGUE}: Give me my book.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: You gonna put it away?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOE
{DIALOGUE}: I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. BLONDE
{DIALOGUE}: Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NICE GUY EDDIE

{CHARACTER_NAME}: NICE GUY EDDIE
{DIALOGUE}: When I was coming down here, I was playin it.
{DIALOGUE}: And "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on.
{DIALOGUE}: Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million- trillion times.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. BLUE
{DIALOGUE}: You didn't know Vicki Lawrence killed the guy?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NICE GUY EDDIE
{DIALOGUE}: I thought the cheatin wife shot Andy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. BLONDE
{DIALOGUE}: They say it in the song.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NICE GUY EDDIE
{DIALOGUE}: I know, I heard it.
{DIALOGUE}: I musta zoned out whenever that part came on before.
{DIALOGUE}: I thought when she said that little sister stuff, she was talkin about her sister- in-law, the cheatin wife.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOE
{DIALOGUE}: No, she did it.
{DIALOGUE}: She killed the cheatin wife, too.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: You know the part in "Gypsies, Tramps and Theives," when she says "Poppa woulda shot his if he knew what he'd done?"

{CHARACTER_NAME}: NICE GUY EDDIE
{DIALOGUE}: Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: I don't believe in it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NICE GUY EDDIE
{DIALOGUE}: You don't believe in tipping?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{META_DATA}: (laughing)
{DIALOGUE}: I love this kid, he's a madman, this guy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. BLONDE

{DIALOGUE}: Don't give me that.
{DIALOGUE}: She don't make enough money, she can quit.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everybody laughs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NICE GUY EDDIE
{DIALOGUE}: I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that.
{DIALOGUE}: So let's get this straight.
{DIALOGUE}: You never ever tip?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: I don't tip because society says I gotta.
{DIALOGUE}: I tip when somebody deserves a tip.
{DIALOGUE}: When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra.
{DIALOGUE}: But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds.
{DIALOGUE}: As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin their job.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. BLUE
{DIALOGUE}: Our girl was nice.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: Our girl was okay.
{DIALOGUE}: She didn't do anything special.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. BLONDE
{DIALOGUE}: What's something special, take ya in the kitchen and suck your dick?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They all laugh.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NICE GUY EDDIE
{DIALOGUE}: I'd go over twelve percent for that.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WRITE
{DIALOGUE}: Look, I ordered coffee.
{DIALOGUE}: Now we've been here a long fuckin time, and she's only filled my cup three times.
{DIALOGUE}: When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. BLONDE
{DIALOGUE}: What if she's too busy?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: The words "too busy" shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NICE GUY EDDIE
{DIALOGUE}: Excuse me, Mr. White, but the last thing you need is another cup of coffee.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They all laugh.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: These ladies aren't starvin to death.
{DIALOGUE}: They make minimum wage.
{DIALOGUE}: When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NICE GUY EDDIE
{DIALOGUE}: Ahh, now we're getting down to it.
{DIALOGUE}: It's not just that he's a cheap bastard--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. ORANGE
{DIALOGUE}: --It is that too--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NICE GUY EDDIE
{DIALOGUE}: --It is that too.
{DIALOGUE}: But it's also he couldn't get a waiter job.
{DIALOGUE}: You talk like a pissed off dishwasher: "Fuck those cunts and their fucking tips."
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. BLONDE
{DIALOGUE}: So you don't care that they're counting on your tip to live?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mr. White rubs two of his fingers together.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know what this is?
{DIALOGUE}: It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. BLONDE
{DIALOGUE}: You don't have any idea what you're talking about.
{DIALOGUE}: These people bust their ass.
{DIALOGUE}: This is a hard job.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: So's working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them.
{DIALOGUE}: They're servin ya food, you should tip em.
{DIALOGUE}: But no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there.
{DIALOGUE}: That's bullshit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. ORANGE
{DIALOGUE}: They work harder than the kids at McDonald's.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: Oh yeah, I don't see them cleaning fryers.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. BROWN
{DIALOGUE}: These people are taxed on the tips they make.
{DIALOGUE}: When you stiff 'em, you cost them money.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. BLONDE
{DIALOGUE}: Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country.
{DIALOGUE}: It's the one jab basically any woman can get, and make a living on.
{DIALOGUE}: The reason is because of tips.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: Fuck all that.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They all laugh.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: Hey, I'm very sorry that the government taxes their tips.
{DIALOGUE}: That's fucked up.
{DIALOGUE}: But that ain't my fault.
{DIALOGUE}: it would appear that waitresses are just one of the many groups the government fucks in the ass on a regular basis.
{DIALOGUE}: You show me a paper says the government shouldn't do that, I'll sign it.
{DIALOGUE}: Put it to a vote, I'll vote for it.
{DIALOGUE}: But what I won't do is play ball.
{DIALOGUE}: And this non- college bullshit you're telling me, I got two words for that: "Learn to fuckin type."
{DIALOGUE}: Cause if you're expecting me to help out with the rent, you're in for a big fuckin surprise.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. ORANGE
{DIALOGUE}: He's convinced me.
{DIALOGUE}: Give me my dollar back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everybody laughs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Joe's comes back to the table.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOE
{DIALOGUE}: Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling.

{DIALOGUE}: One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there.
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't hear any sirens.
{DIALOGUE}: The alarm went off, okay.
{DIALOGUE}: Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time.
{DIALOGUE}: Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond.
{DIALOGUE}: In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there.
{DIALOGUE}: All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there!

{META_DATA}: (pause)
{DIALOGUE}: You haven't thought about this?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: Well, you better start thinking about it.
{DIALOGUE}: Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it.
{DIALOGUE}: In fact, that's all I'm thinking about.
{DIALOGUE}: I came this close to just driving off.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: No real people?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: Uh-uh, just cops.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen.
{DIALOGUE}: Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: I don't wanna kill anybody.
{DIALOGUE}: But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin outta my way.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: That's the way I look at it.
{DIALOGUE}: A choice between doin ten years, and takin out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all.
{DIALOGUE}: But I ain't no madman either.
{DIALOGUE}: What the fuck was Joe thinkin?
{DIALOGUE}: You can't work with a guy like that.

{DIALOGUE}: I think he's a sick fuckin maniac!
{DIALOGUE}: We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place.
{DIALOGUE}: I came this fucking close-- (hold up two fingers and makes a tiny space between them) --to taking his ass out myself.

{DIALOGUE}: It's human nature.
{DIALOGUE}: But ya panic on the inside.
{DIALOGUE}: Ya panic in your head.
{DIALOGUE}: Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation.
{DIALOGUE}: What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin professional.
{DIALOGUE}: A psychopath is not a professional.
{DIALOGUE}: You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next.
{DIALOGUE}: I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was?
{DIALOGUE}: Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it.
{DIALOGUE}: After that, I don't know what went down.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: At that point it became every man for himself.
{DIALOGUE}: As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest.
{DIALOGUE}: Once I got out, I never looked back.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: What do you think?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: What do I think?
{DIALOGUE}: I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: Not even a chance they punched through?
{DIALOGUE}: You found a hole.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle.
{DIALOGUE}: But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: You don't think it's possible, one of them got ahold of the diamonds and pulled a--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: Nope.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: How can you be so sure?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: Where?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: Where?
{DIALOGUE}: Are they out in the car?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: No, they're not in the car.
{DIALOGUE}: No, I don't have them on me.
{DIALOGUE}: Ya wanna go with me and get 'em?

{DIALOGUE}: We were fuckin set up!
{DIALOGUE}: Somebody is in league with the cops.
{DIALOGUE}: We got a Judas in our midst.
{DIALOGUE}: And I'm thinkin we should have our fuckin heads examined for waiting around here.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: That was the plan, we meet here.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: Then where is everybody?
{DIALOGUE}: I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house.
{DIALOGUE}: We ain't got the slightest fuckin idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue.
{DIALOGUE}: They could both be dead or arrested.
{DIALOGUE}: They could be sweatin 'em, down at the station house right now.
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place.
{DIALOGUE}: I mean, that could be happening right now.
{DIALOGUE}: As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin here this minute.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: I swear to god I'm fuckin jinxed.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: What?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: So who's the rat this time?
{DIALOGUE}: Mr. Blue?
{DIALOGUE}: Mr. Blonde?
{DIALOGUE}: Joe?
{DIALOGUE}: It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up.
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe he set it up to set it up.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: I don't buy it.
{DIALOGUE}: Me and Joe go back a long time.
{DIALOGUE}: I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, you and Joe go back a long time.
{DIALOGUE}: I known Joe since I was a kid.
{DIALOGUE}: But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous.
{DIALOGUE}: I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do.
{DIALOGUE}: But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know.
{DIALOGUE}: For all I know, you're the rat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: For all I know, you're the rat.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mr. White pushes him out of the way.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He feels the pulse on Mr. Orange's neck.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: So, is he dead or what?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: He ain't dead.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: So what is it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: I think he's just passed out.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mr. White stands up and walks over to a table.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: We can't take him to a hospital.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night.
{DIALOGUE}: That bullet in his belly is my fault.
{DIALOGUE}: Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me.
{DIALOGUE}: And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: Well, first things first, staying here's goofy.
{DIALOGUE}: We gotta book up.

{DIALOGUE}: So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: You gotta idea, spit it out.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: During Mr. Pink's dialog, we slowly ZOOM in to a C.U. of Mr. White.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK (OS)
{DIALOGUE}: Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him?
{DIALOGUE}: He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here.
{DIALOGUE}: Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us.
{DIALOGUE}: Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now.
{DIALOGUE}: Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians...Jesus Christ!
{DIALOGUE}: I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight.
{DIALOGUE}: If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin me to take him to a hospital.
{DIALOGUE}: Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead.
{DIALOGUE}: He begged me to do it.
{DIALOGUE}: I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK (OS)
{DIALOGUE}: Well Joe ain't gettin here.
{DIALOGUE}: We're on our own.
{DIALOGUE}: Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know anybody.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK (OS)

{DIALOGUE}: And he asked me what my name was.
{DIALOGUE}: I mean, the man was dyin in my arms.
{DIALOGUE}: What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules.
{DIALOGUE}: I don't trust you enough."
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE (OS)
{DIALOGUE}: Don't fuckin patronize me.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE (OS)
{DIALOGUE}: Of course.

{DIALOGUE}: I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already.
{DIALOGUE}: But now he knows: (a) what you look like, (b) what your first name is, (i) where you're from and (d) what your specialty is.
{DIALOGUE}: They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out.
{DIALOGUE}: That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE (OS)

{DIALOGUE}: Then she takes some crazy glue and glues his dick to his belly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The car reacts to how horrible that would be.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDDIE

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOE
{DIALOGUE}: No hurry.
{META_DATA}: (to the boys)
{DIALOGUE}: All right, let's get to know one another.
{DIALOGUE}: With the exception of Eddie and myself, who you already know, you'll be using aliases.
{DIALOGUE}: Under no circumstances are you to tell one another your real name or anything else about yourself.
{DIALOGUE}: That includes where you're from, your wife's name, where you might've done time, about a bank in St. Petersburg you might've robbed.
{DIALOGUE}: You guys don't say shit about who you are, where you been or what you've done.
{DIALOGUE}: Only thing you guys can talk about is what you're going to do.
{DIALOGUE}: This way the only ones who know who the members of the team are are Eddie and myself.
{DIALOGUE}: And that's the way I like it.
{DIALOGUE}: Because in the unlikely event of one of you getting apprehended by the cops, not that I expect that to happen - it most definitely should not happen - it hasn't happened, you don't have anything to deal with.
{DIALOGUE}: You don't know any names.
{DIALOGUE}: You know my name, you know Eddie's name.
{DIALOGUE}: That I don't care about.
{DIALOGUE}: You gotta prove it.

{DIALOGUE}: You're Mr. Pink.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: Who cares what your name is?
{DIALOGUE}: Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White.
{DIALOGUE}: You gotta cool-sounding name.
{DIALOGUE}: So tell me, Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOE
{DIALOGUE}: Nobody's trading with anybody!
{DIALOGUE}: Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin city counsel meeting!
{DIALOGUE}: Listen up Mr. Pink.
{DIALOGUE}: We got two ways here, my way or the highway.
{DIALOGUE}: And you can go down either of 'em.
{DIALOGUE}: So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. PINK
{DIALOGUE}: Jesus Christ, Joe.
{DIALOGUE}: Fuckin forget it.

{DIALOGUE}: You gotta make sure they don't have to move in.
{DIALOGUE}: You're inside to make sure that everything goes according to Hoyle.
{DIALOGUE}: We have men set up a block away from the warehouse rendezvous.
{DIALOGUE}: They got complete visibility of the exterior.
{DIALOGUE}: So as soon as Joe Cabot shows up, we'll see it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FREDDY
{DIALOGUE}: What's your visibility of the interior?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HOLDAWAY
{DIALOGUE}: We can't see shit on the inside.
{DIALOGUE}: And we can't risk gettin any closer for fear they'll spot us.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FREDDY
{DIALOGUE}: This is bullshit, Jim.
{DIALOGUE}: I get all the fuckin danger of having you guys in my back pocket but none of the safety.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HOLDAWAY
{DIALOGUE}: What's the matter, Newendyke?
{DIALOGUE}: Job too tough for ya?
{DIALOGUE}: No one lied to you.
{DIALOGUE}: You always knew we'd hang back until Joe Cabot showed up.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FREDDY
{DIALOGUE}: Oh this is great.
{DIALOGUE}: You ain't giving me no fuckin protection whatsoever.
{DIALOGUE}: But you are giving me an attitude.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HOLDAWAY
{DIALOGUE}: Since when does an undercover cop have protection?
{DIALOGUE}: Freddy, you came into this thing with your eyes wide open, so don't start screamin blind man now.
{DIALOGUE}: I understand you're nervous.
{DIALOGUE}: I wish the warehouse had more visible windows, but it doesn't.
{DIALOGUE}: We have to make do with the cards we're dealt.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FREDDY
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't say I wasn't gonna do it.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm just remarking on how shitty the situation is!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HOLDAWAY
{DIALOGUE}: I don't mean to be harsh with ya, but I've found tough love works best in these situations.
{DIALOGUE}: We have to get Joe Cabot in the company of the thieves and in the same vicinity as the loot.
{DIALOGUE}: We don't care about these other bastards.
{DIALOGUE}: We're willing to offer them good deals to testify against Cabot.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FREDDY
{DIALOGUE}: Isn't this risk unorthodox?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HOLDAWAY
{DIALOGUE}: What?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FREDDY
{DIALOGUE}: Letting them go ahead with the robbery?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HOLDAWAY
{DIALOGUE}: The whole idea behind this operation is to catch Joe Cabot red-handed.
{DIALOGUE}: We bust these hired hands, we ain't accomplished shit.
{DIALOGUE}: Letting them go through with the heist is a risk, but Cabot's jobs are very clean.
{DIALOGUE}: We got people surrounding the perimeter.
{DIALOGUE}: We got a guy and a gal on the inside posing as a couple shopping for rings.
{DIALOGUE}: We could replace the employees with cops, but we'd run the risk of tipping 'em off.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FREDDY
{DIALOGUE}: That's out.
{DIALOGUE}: They know the faces of who works what shift.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HOLDAWAY
{DIALOGUE}: These guys are professionals.

{DIALOGUE}: What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. WHITE
{DIALOGUE}: When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass.
{DIALOGUE}: They're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever.
{DIALOGUE}: If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in.
{DIALOGUE}: Drops 'em right to the floor.
{DIALOGUE}: Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose.
{DIALOGUE}: Freaks everybody out.
{DIALOGUE}: Nobody says fuckin shit after that.
{DIALOGUE}: You might get some bitch talk shit to ya.
{DIALOGUE}: But give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face next.
{DIALOGUE}: Watch her shut the fuck up.
{DIALOGUE}: Now if it's a manager, that's a different story.
{DIALOGUE}: The managers know better than to fuck around.
{DIALOGUE}: So if one's givin you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy.
{DIALOGUE}: So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a- bitch in two.
{DIALOGUE}: If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers.
{DIALOGUE}: The little one.
{DIALOGUE}: Then you tell 'im his thumb's next.
