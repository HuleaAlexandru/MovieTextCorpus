{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{META_DATA}: (into comlink)
{DIALOGUE}: Right.

{DIALOGUE}: I'm sorry to hear that.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Well, there's a price on my head.
{DIALOGUE}: If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, I'm a dead man.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIEEKAN
{DIALOGUE}: A death mark's not an easy thing to live with.
{DIALOGUE}: You're a good fighter, Solo.

{DIALOGUE}: Thank you, General.

{DIALOGUE}: Han, we need you!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN

{DIALOGUE}: Yes.

{META_DATA}: (mystified)
{DIALOGUE}: I need?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{META_DATA}: (shakes his head, fed up)
{DIALOGUE}: You probably don't.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEIA
{DIALOGUE}: And what precisely am I supposed to know?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Come on!
{DIALOGUE}: You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEIA
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{DIALOGUE}: You're a great help to us.
{DIALOGUE}: You're a natural leader...

{DIALOGUE}: No!
{DIALOGUE}: That's not it.
{DIALOGUE}: Come on.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEIA
{DIALOGUE}: You're imagining things.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Am I?
{DIALOGUE}: Then why are you following me?
{DIALOGUE}: Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEIA
{DIALOGUE}: I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: I can arrange that.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Don't try to blame me.
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater.
{DIALOGUE}: I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess' chamber.
{DIALOGUE}: But it's supposed to be freezing.
{DIALOGUE}: How are we going to dry out all her clothes?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Well, it's Princess Leia, sir.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: I turned it off.
{DIALOGUE}: I don't want to talk to her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO

{DIALOGUE}: She doesn't know where he is.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know where he is.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Nobody knows where he is.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: What do you mean, "nobody knows"?

{DIALOGUE}: Yes, sir?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DECK OFFICER
{DIALOGUE}: I haven't seen him.
{DIALOGUE}: It's possible he came in through the south entrance.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN

{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Excuse me, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: Might I inquire what's going on?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Why not?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Impossible man.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN ICE TUNNEL
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The deck officer and his assistant hurry toward Han as he enters the tunnel.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DECK OFFICER
{DIALOGUE}: Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the south entrance.
{DIALOGUE}: He might have forgotten to check in.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Not likely.
{DIALOGUE}: Are the speeders ready?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DECK OFFICER
{DIALOGUE}: Not yet.
{DIALOGUE}: We're having some trouble adapting them to the cold.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He opens his eyes as a chilling moan of the hideous ice creature echoes off the gorge walls.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and futilely tries to unfasten the throngs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Exhausted, he drops back into his hanging position.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he hangs there, he spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his discarded gear, about three feet out of reach.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He focuses on the saber and, as his hand strains toward the weapon, he squeezes his eyes tight in concentration.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The young warrior instantly ignites his sword, swinging up, and cuts himself loose from the ice.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Threepio moves stiffly over to him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: You must come along now, Artoo.
{DIALOGUE}: There's really nothing more we can do.
{DIALOGUE}: And my joints are freezing up.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo beeps, long and low.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Don't say thing like that!
{DIALOGUE}: Of course we'll see Master Luke again.
{DIALOGUE}: He'll be quite all right, you'll see.
{META_DATA}: (to himself)
{DIALOGUE}: Stupid little short-circuit.
{DIALOGUE}: He'll be quite all right.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A Rebel lieutenant moves to Major Derlin, an officer keeping watch with the princess.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LIEUTENANT
{DIALOGUE}: Sir, all the patrols are in.
{DIALOGUE}: There's still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leia nods an acknowledgment, but she is lost in thought.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DERLIN
{DIALOGUE}: Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight.
{DIALOGUE}: The shield doors must be closed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns to the lieutenant.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DERLIN
{DIALOGUE}: Close the doors.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LIEUTENANT
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, sir.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The lieutenant walks away.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At the same moment, Artoo begins a complex series of efficient beeps.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five... to one.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chewie lets out another suffering howl.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO

{DIALOGUE}: Oh, dear, oh, dear.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't worry about Master Luke.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm sure he'll be all right.
{DIALOGUE}: He's quite clever, you know... for a human being.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSK
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke lies face down in the snow, nearly unconscious.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Slowly he looks up and sees Ben Kenobi, barely visible through the blowing snow.

{DIALOGUE}: Luke... Luke.

{META_DATA}: (weakly)
{DIALOGUE}: Ben?

{DIALOGUE}: Ben... Ben.

{DIALOGUE}: Luke!
{DIALOGUE}: Luke!
{DIALOGUE}: Don't do this, Luke.
{DIALOGUE}: Come on, give me a sign here.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he starts to lift the youth, Han hears a rasping sound behind him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns, just in time to see his Tauntaun stagger and then fall over into the snow.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Han carries Luke to the moaning beast.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, with a final groan, the Tauntaun expires.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Not much time.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pushes Luke's inert form against the belly of the dead beast.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{META_DATA}: (moaning)

{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Dagobah system...

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He quickly tosses it's steaming innards into the snow, then lifts Luke's inert form and stuffs him inside the carcass.

{META_DATA}: (reeling from the odor)
{DIALOGUE}: Whew...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Dagobah...

{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: ...but it will keep you warm... til I get the shelter built.
{META_DATA}: (struggling to get
{META_DATA}: Luke inside the
{META_DATA}: carcass)
{DIALOGUE}: Ooh... I thought they smelled bad on the outside!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The wind has picked up considerably, making it difficult to move.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Han removes a pack from the dead creature's back, taking out a shelter container.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEIA
{DIALOGUE}: Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet?

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo beeps, this time a slightly worried question.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{META_DATA}: (into comlink)
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{META_DATA}: (into comlink)

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, there is a cracking sound as if limbs were being broken off trees and then a tremendous jolt as the spacecraft stops.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke pulls a switch and his canopy pops open.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. DAGOBAH - DUSK

{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Artoo?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke kneels and leans over the plane looking for Artoo, but the water is still and reveals no sign of the little droid.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Artoo!
{DIALOGUE}: Where are you?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A small periscope breaks the surface of the water and a gurgly beep is heard.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The periscope starts to move to shore.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Relieved, Luke starts running along the nose of the fighter to its tip.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Artoo!
{DIALOGUE}: You be more careful.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The outline of the shore is now more than ten feet away.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke jumps off the plane into the water, scrambles up to the shore, and turns to look for Artoo.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The periscope still steadily moves toward shore.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Artoo - that way!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, through the thick fog layer, a dark shape appears, moving toward the little droid.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The dark, sinuous bog beast dives beneath the swampy water, making a loud clunk against Artoo's metal hull.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The droid disappears from sight, uttering a pathetic electronic scream.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Holding his ignited lightsaber before him, Luke wades a few feet into the murky pool, looking for any sign of his little friend.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Artoo!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The black surface is still as death itself... until a few bubbles begin to appear.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, phheewaat!!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The runt-size robot is spit out of the water, makes a graceful arc, and comes crashing down into a patch of soft gray moss.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, no!
{DIALOGUE}: Are you all right?
{DIALOGUE}: Come on.
{DIALOGUE}: You're lucky you don't taste very good.
{DIALOGUE}: Anything broken?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke helps Artoo to his feet and begins wiping the mud and roots from his round metal body.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo responds with feeble, soggy beeps.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree with you.
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here?
{DIALOGUE}: It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know.
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe I'm just going crazy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Luke glances around at the spooky swamp jungle that surrounds him, Artoo ejects a stream of muddy water from one of his cranial ports.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Among the various apparatuses surrounding them, a respirator tube now retracts from Vader's uncovered head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The head is bald with a mass of ugly scar tissue covering it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The black droid then lowers the mask and helmet onto Vader's head.

{DIALOGUE}: Yes, Admiral?

{DIALOGUE}: Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but... does that include shutting me down, too?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chewie barks "yes".
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But Han thinks otherwise.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, the ship lurches, causing all the loose items in the cockpit to go flying.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chewie howls.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Not entirely stable?
{DIALOGUE}: I'm glad you're here to tell us these things.
{DIALOGUE}: Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Oh!
{DIALOGUE}: Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior.
{DIALOGUE}: After all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The sliding door closes behind the indignant Threepio as Chewie and he move back to the hold.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, the ship lurches again, throwing Leia across the cabin into Han's arms.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With some surprise, Han and Leia realize they are in each other's arms.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEIA
{DIALOGUE}: Let go.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEIA
{DIALOGUE}: Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Sorry, sweetheart.
{DIALOGUE}: We haven't got time for anything else.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leia's confused emotions show clearly on her lovely face.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG CLEARING - DUSK
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The mist has dispersed a bit, but it is still a very gloomy-looking swamp.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke pulls an equipment box from the shore to the clearing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He ignites a little fusion furnace and warms his hands before it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Taking a power cable, he plugs it into Artoo's noselike socket.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Ready for some power?
{DIALOGUE}: Okay.
{DIALOGUE}: Let's see now.
{DIALOGUE}: Put that in there.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke then opens a container of processed food and sits before the thermal heater.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{META_DATA}: (sighs)
{DIALOGUE}: Now all I have to do is find this Yoda... if he even exists.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Nervously, he looks around at the foreboding jungle.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE

{DIALOGUE}: I feel like... I don't know...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: STRANGE VOICE
{DIALOGUE}: Feel like what?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke jumps out of his skin.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo screeches in terror.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE

{DIALOGUE}: Ahhh!
{DIALOGUE}: A great warrior.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo moves to the edge of the case - standing almost eye level to the creature who is carelessly handling the supplies - and squeaks his disapproval.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Their tiny visitor pick up the container of food Luke was eating from and takes a bite.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Hey, you could have broken this.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't do that.
{DIALOGUE}: Ohhh... you're making a mess.
{DIALOGUE}: Hey, give me that!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CREATURE
{META_DATA}: (retreating with the lamp)
{DIALOGUE}: Mine!
{DIALOGUE}: Or I will help you not.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clutching its treasure, the creature backs away from Luke, drawing closer to Artoo.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Luke and the creature argue, one of Artoo's little arms slowly moves out toward the power lamp, completely unnoticed by the creature.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: I don't want your help.
{DIALOGUE}: I want my lamp back.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CREATURE
{DIALOGUE}: Mudhole?
{DIALOGUE}: Slimy?
{DIALOGUE}: My home this is.

{DIALOGUE}: Good food.
{DIALOGUE}: Come.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With that, the creature scurries out of the clearing, laughing merrily.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All he sees is the faint light from the small power lamp moving through the fog.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke makes his decision and starts after the creature.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CREATURE
{META_DATA}: (in the distance)
{DIALOGUE}: Come, come.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Artoo, very upset, whistles a blue streak of protest.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, where is Artoo when I need him?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Han enters the hold area and kneels on the floor near the control box.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect.
{DIALOGUE}: I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Well, of course I'll have to replace it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He hands a wire coil up to Chewie who is working near the ceiling.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Here!
{DIALOGUE}: And Chewie...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chewie brings his head back through the trap door in the ceiling and whines.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Han glances back at Threepio, then speaks quietly to Chewie so only he can hear.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: ... I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leia finishes welding the valves she has been working on and attempts to reengage the system by pulling a lever attached to the valve.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It doesn't budge.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Han notices her struggle, and moves to help her.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She rebuffs him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help.

{DIALOGUE}: Sure, Leia.

{DIALOGUE}: Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: I do, I really do.
{DIALOGUE}: You could be a little nicer, though.
{META_DATA}: (he watches her reaction)
{DIALOGUE}: Come on, admit it.
{DIALOGUE}: Sometimes you think I'm all right.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She lets go of the lever and rubs her sore hand.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEIA
{DIALOGUE}: Occasionally...
{META_DATA}: (a little smile, haltingly)
{DIALOGUE}: ... when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{META_DATA}: (laughs)
{DIALOGUE}: Scoundrel?
{DIALOGUE}: Scoundrel?
{DIALOGUE}: I like the sound of that.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With that, Han takes her hand and starts to massage it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEIA
{DIALOGUE}: Stop that.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEIA
{DIALOGUE}: Stop that!

{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEIA
{META_DATA}: (looking right into his eyes)
{DIALOGUE}: Afraid?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Han looks at her with a piercing look.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He draws it toward him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: You're trembling.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEIA
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not trembling.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then with an irresistible combination of physical strength and emotional power, the space pirate begins to draw Leia toward him... very slowly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: You like me because I'm a scoundrel.
{DIALOGUE}: There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leia is now very close to Han and as she speaks, her voice becomes an excited whisper, a tone completely in opposition to her words.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEIA
{DIALOGUE}: I happen to like nice men.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: I'm a nice man.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEIA
{DIALOGUE}: No, you're not.
{DIALOGUE}: You're...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He kisses her now, with slow, hot lips.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes his time, as though he had forever, bending her body backward.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She has never been kissed like this before, and it almost makes her faint.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When he stops, she regains her breath and tries to work up some indignation, but finds it hard to talk.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, Threepio appears in the doorway, speaking excitedly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Sir, sir!
{DIALOGUE}: I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Han turns slowly, icily, from their embrace.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Thank you.
{DIALOGUE}: Thank you very much.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The stove is a steaming hodgepodge of pots and pans.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The wizened little host scurries about chopping this, shredding that, and showering everything with exotic herbs and spices.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He rushes back and forth putting platters on the table in front of Luke, who watches the creature impatiently.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Look, I'm sure it's delicious.
{DIALOGUE}: I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CREATURE
{DIALOGUE}: Patience!
{DIALOGUE}: For the Jedi it is time to eat as well.
{DIALOGUE}: Eat, eat.
{DIALOGUE}: Hot.
{DIALOGUE}: Good food, hm?
{DIALOGUE}: Good, hmm?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Moving with some difficulty in the cramped quarters, Luke sits down near the fire and serves himself from the pot.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: How far away is Yoda?
{DIALOGUE}: Will it take us long to get there?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CREATURE
{DIALOGUE}: Not far.
{DIALOGUE}: Yoda not far.
{DIALOGUE}: Patience.
{DIALOGUE}: Soon you will be with him.
{META_DATA}: (tasting food from the pot)
{DIALOGUE}: Rootleaf, I cook.
{DIALOGUE}: Why wish you become Jedi?
{DIALOGUE}: Hm?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE

{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The creature turns away from Luke and speaks to a third party.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CREATURE
{META_DATA}: (irritated)
{DIALOGUE}: I cannot teach him.
{DIALOGUE}: The boy has no patience.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke's head spins in the direction the creature faces.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But there is no one there.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The boy is bewildered, but it gradually dawns on him that the little creature is Yoda, the Jedi Master, and that he is speaking with Ben.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN'S VOICE
{DIALOGUE}: He will learn patience.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YODA
{DIALOGUE}: Hmmm.
{DIALOGUE}: Much anger in him, like his father.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN'S VOICE

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Trying to see Ben, Luke starts to get up but hits his head on the low ceiling.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YODA
{DIALOGUE}: Ready, are you?
{DIALOGUE}: What know you of ready?
{DIALOGUE}: For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi.
{DIALOGUE}: My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained!
{DIALOGUE}: A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.
{META_DATA}: (to the invisible Ben, indicating Luke)
{DIALOGUE}: This one a long time have I watched.
{DIALOGUE}: All his life has he looked away... to the future, to the horizon.
{DIALOGUE}: Never his mind on where he was.
{DIALOGUE}: Hmm?
{DIALOGUE}: What he was doing.
{DIALOGUE}: Hmph.
{DIALOGUE}: Adventure.
{DIALOGUE}: Heh!
{DIALOGUE}: Excitement.
{DIALOGUE}: Heh!
{DIALOGUE}: A Jedi craves not these things.
{META_DATA}: (turning to Luke)
{DIALOGUE}: You are reckless!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke looks down.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He knows it is true.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEN'S VOICE
{DIALOGUE}: So was I, if you'll remember.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YODA
{DIALOGUE}: He is too old.
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, too old to begin the training.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Luke thinks he detects a subtle softening in Yoda's voice.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: But I've learned so much.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Yoda turns his piercing gaze on Luke, as though the Jedi Master's huge eyes could somehow determine how much the boy had learned.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After a long moment, the little Jedi turns toward where he alone sees Ben.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YODA
{META_DATA}: (sighs)
{DIALOGUE}: Will he finished what he begins?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE

{DIALOGUE}: Mynocks?

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Threepio sees it too.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: Look!

{DIALOGUE}: I see it, I see it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, a row of jagged white stalagmites and stalactites can be seen surrounding the entrance.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And as the Falcon moves forward, the entrance to the cave grows ever smaller.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Han pulls hard on the throttle, sending his ship surging forward.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: We're doomed!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEIA
{DIALOGUE}: The cave is collapsing.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEIA
{DIALOGUE}: What?

{DIALOGUE}: Run!
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.

{DIALOGUE}: If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: Vader.
{DIALOGUE}: Is the dark side stronger?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YODA
{DIALOGUE}: No... no... no.
{DIALOGUE}: Quicker, easier, more seductive.

{DIALOGUE}: But how am I to know the good side from the bad?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YODA
{DIALOGUE}: You will know.
{DIALOGUE}: When you are calm, at peace.
{DIALOGUE}: Passive.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: YODA
{META_DATA}: (interrupting)
{DIALOGUE}: No, no, there is no why.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: LUKE
{DIALOGUE}: I feel cold, death.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YODA
{DIALOGUE}: That place... is strong with the dark side of the Force.
{DIALOGUE}: A domain of evil it is.
{DIALOGUE}: In you must go.

{DIALOGUE}: What's in there?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YODA
{DIALOGUE}: Only what you take with you.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The space widens around him, but he feels that rather than sees it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His sword casts the only light as he peers into the darkness.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is very quiet here.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, a loud HISS!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Darth Vader appears across the blackness, illuminated by his own just-ignited laser sword.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is upon the youth in seconds, but Luke sidesteps perfectly and slashes at Vader with his sword.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Vader is decapitated.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His helmet-encased head flies from his shoulders as his body disappears into the darkness.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The metallic banging of the helmet fills the cave as Vader's head spins and bounces, smashes on the floor, and finally stops.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: PIETT
{DIALOGUE}: Right.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The group standing before Vader is a bizarre array of galactic fortune hunters There is Bossk, a slimy, tentacled monster with two huge, bloodshot eyes in a soft baggy face; Zuckuss and Dengar, two battle- scarred, mangy human types; IG-88, a battered, tarnished chrome war droid; and Boba Fett, a man in a weapon-covered armored space suit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER

{DIALOGUE}: So you're part of the mining guild then?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LANDO
{DIALOGUE}: No, not actually.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The group walks into another corridor and heads for a huge doorway at the far end.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAN
{DIALOGUE}: Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down?

{DIALOGUE}: Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{DIALOGUE}: They must never again leave this city.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LANDO
{DIALOGUE}: That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His one attached arm is animate and expressive, intermittently pointing, gesturing, and covering his eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The remaining pieces of his body are randomly bundled to the Wookiee's back so that his legs and other arm stick out at odd angles from the pack.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chewie howls.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leia turns away in agony.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lando winces in sorrow; it makes a life-changing impression on him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Instantly, fiery liquid begins to pour down in a shower of sparks and fluid as great as any steel furnace.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Holding Leia, Chewie half-turns away from the sight, giving Threepio a view of the procedure.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: THREEPIO
{DIALOGUE}: What... what's going on?
{DIALOGUE}: Turn round, Chewbacca, I can't see.
{DIALOGUE}: Oh... they've encased him in carbonite.
{DIALOGUE}: He should be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing process, that is.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chewie is in no mood for technical discussion; he gives the droid an angry glance and bark.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A huge mechanical tong lifts the steaming metal-encased space pirate out of the vat and stands him on the platform.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Some Ugnaughts rush over and push the block over onto the platform.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{DIALOGUE}: Good.
{DIALOGUE}: See to it that he finds his way here.
{DIALOGUE}: Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LANDO
{DIALOGUE}: You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VADER
{DIALOGUE}: I am altering the deal.
{DIALOGUE}: Pray I don't alter it any further.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lando's hand instinctively goes to his throat as he turns to Leia, Chewie, and Threepio.
