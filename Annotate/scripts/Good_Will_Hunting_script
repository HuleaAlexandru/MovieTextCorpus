{DIALOGUE}: So, you ladies ah, go to school here?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LYDIA
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHUCKIE
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, cause I think I had a class with you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At this point, several interested parties materialize.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHUCKIE
{DIALOGUE}: History.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARK
{DIALOGUE}: How'd you like that course?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHUCKIE
{DIALOGUE}: Good, it was all right.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARK
{DIALOGUE}: History?
{DIALOGUE}: Just "history?"
{DIALOGUE}: It must have been a survey course then.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chuckie nods.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clark notices Chuckie's clothes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will and Billy exchange a look and move subtly closer.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARK
{DIALOGUE}: Pretty broad.
{DIALOGUE}: "History of the World?"
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHUCKIE
{DIALOGUE}: Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day.
{DIALOGUE}: That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARK
{DIALOGUE}: Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar.
{DIALOGUE}: But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARK
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, I'm sure you covered it in your history class.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clark looks to see if the girls are impressed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are not.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When Clark looks back to Chuckie, Skylar turns to Lydia and rolls her [own] eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They laugh.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will sees this and smiles.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHUCKIE
{DIALOGUE}: To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much.
{DIALOGUE}: The class was rather elementary.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARK
{DIALOGUE}: Elementary?
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, I don't doubt that it was.
{DIALOGUE}: I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will and Billy come forward, stand behind Chuckie.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHUCKIE
{DIALOGUE}: All right, are we gonna have a problem?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARK
{DIALOGUE}: There's no problem.
{DIALOGUE}: I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies.
{DIALOGUE}: My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian precapitalist and...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will, who at this point has migrated to Chuckie's side and is completely fed-up, includes himself in the conversation.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Of course that's your contention.
{DIALOGUE}: You're a first year grad student.
{DIALOGUE}: You just finished some Marxian historian, Pete Garrison prob'ly, and so naturally that's what you believe until next month when you get to James Lemon and get convinced that Virginia and Pennsylvania were strongly entrepreneurial and capitalist back in 1740.
{DIALOGUE}: That'll last until sometime in your second year, then you'll be in here regurgitating Gordon Wood about the Pre-revolutionary utopia and the capital-forming effects of military mobilization.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARK
{META_DATA}: (taken aback)
{DIALOGUE}: Well, as a matter of fact, I won't, because Wood drastically underestimates the impact of--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: "Wood drastically underestimates the impact of social distinctions predicated upon wealth, especially inherited wealth..." You got that from "Work in Essex County," Page 421, right?
{DIALOGUE}: Do you have any thoughts of your own on the subject or were you just gonna plagiarize the whole book for me?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clark is stunned.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Look, don't try to pass yourself off as some kind of an intellect at the expense of my friend just to impress these girls.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clark is lost now, searching for a graceful exit, any exit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: The sad thing is, in about 50 years you might start doin' some thinkin' on your own and by then you'll realize there are only two certainties in life.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARK
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah?
{DIALOGUE}: What're those?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: One, don't do that.
{DIALOGUE}: Two -- you dropped a hundred and fifty grand on an education you coulda' picked up for a dollar fifty in late charges at the Public Library.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will catches Skylar's eye.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARK
{DIALOGUE}: But I will have a degree, and you'll be serving my kids fries at a drive through on our way to a skiing trip.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{META_DATA}: (smiles)
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe.
{DIALOGUE}: But at least I won't be a prick.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: And if you got a problem with that, I guess we can step outside and deal with it that way.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: While Will is substantially smaller than Clark, he [Clark] decides not to take Will up on his [Will's] offer.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: SKYLAR
{DIALOGUE}: Skylar.
{DIALOGUE}: And by the way.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: SKYLAR
{DIALOGUE}: Well, look, I have to go.
{DIALOGUE}: Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: SKYLAR
{DIALOGUE}: Here's my number.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Skylar produces a folded piece of paper and offers it to Will.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SKYLAR
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe we could go out for coffee sometime?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SKYLAR
{DIALOGUE}: What?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SKYLAR
{META_DATA}: (laughs)
{DIALOGUE}: Okay, sounds good.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She turns.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL

{CHARACTER_NAME}: SEAN
{DIALOGUE}: I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting.
{DIALOGUE}: I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occurred to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since.
{DIALOGUE}: You know what occurred to me?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: SEAN
{DIALOGUE}: You've never been out of Boston.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SEAN
{DIALOGUE}: So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written... Michelangelo?
{DIALOGUE}: You know a lot about him I bet.
{DIALOGUE}: Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations.
{DIALOGUE}: But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel.
{DIALOGUE}: You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling.
{DIALOGUE}: And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too.
{DIALOGUE}: But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy.
{DIALOGUE}: If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one.
{DIALOGUE}: You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help.
{DIALOGUE}: And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable.
{DIALOGUE}: Known that someone could kill you with a look.
{DIALOGUE}: That someone could rescue you from grief.
{DIALOGUE}: That God had put an angel on Earth just for you.
{DIALOGUE}: And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel.
{DIALOGUE}: To have the love be there for her forever.
{DIALOGUE}: Through anything, through cancer.
{DIALOGUE}: You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you.
{DIALOGUE}: And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much.
{DIALOGUE}: I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal.
{DIALOGUE}: I see a boy.
{DIALOGUE}: Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will?
{DIALOGUE}: Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw.
{DIALOGUE}: You must know everything about me.
{DIALOGUE}: You're an orphan, right?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will nods quietly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SEAN
{DIALOGUE}: Do you think I would presume to know the first thing about who you are because I read "Oliver Twist?"
{DIALOGUE}: And I don't buy the argument that you don't want to be here, because I think you like all the attention you're getting.
{DIALOGUE}: Personally, I don't care.
{DIALOGUE}: There's nothing you can tell me that I can't read somewhere else.
{DIALOGUE}: Unless we talk about your life.
{DIALOGUE}: But you won't do that.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL

{DIALOGUE}: Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them.
{DIALOGUE}: They saw a piano and they could play.
{DIALOGUE}: I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SKYLAR
{DIALOGUE}: But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--

{DIALOGUE}: Will, on your own time, you can do what you like.

{DIALOGUE}: So am I.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.

{DIALOGUE}: It's a long story.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: You all set?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LAMBEAU
{DIALOGUE}: I've got the first part.
{DIALOGUE}: The rest I can do at home.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will gets up.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LAMBEAU
{DIALOGUE}: Will, the N.S.A. has been calling me just about every hour.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: I guess.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SEAN
{DIALOGUE}: What did you think?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: What did I think?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Will has obviously been stewing on this.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Say I'm working at N.S.A. Somebody puts a code on my desk, something nobody else can break.
{DIALOGUE}: So I take a shot at it and maybe I break it.
{DIALOGUE}: And I'm real happy with myself, 'cause I did my job well.
{DIALOGUE}: But maybe that code was the location of some rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East.
{DIALOGUE}: Once they have that location, they bomb the village where the rebels were hiding and fifteen hundred people I never had a problem with get killed.
{DIALOGUE}: (rapid fire) Now the politicians are sayin' "send in the Marines to secure the area" 'cause they don't give a shit.
{DIALOGUE}: It won't be their kid over there, gettin' shot.
{DIALOGUE}: Just like it wasn't them when their number got called, 'cause they were pullin' a tour in the National Guard.
{DIALOGUE}: It'll be some guy from Southie takin' shrapnel in the ass.
{DIALOGUE}: And he comes home to find that the plant he used to work at got exported to the country he just got back from.
{DIALOGUE}: And the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job, 'cause he'll work for fifteen cents a day and no bathroom breaks.
{DIALOGUE}: Meanwhile my buddy from Southie realizes the only reason he was over there was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price.
{DIALOGUE}: And of course the oil companies used the skirmish to scare up oil prices so they could turn a quick buck.
{DIALOGUE}: A cute, little ancillary benefit for them but it ain't helping my buddy at two-fifty a gallon.
{DIALOGUE}: And naturally they're takin' their sweet time bringin' the oil back and maybe even took the liberty of hiring an alcoholic skipper who likes to drink seven and sevens and play slalom with the icebergs and it ain't too long 'til he hits one, spills the oil, and kills all the sea-life in the North Atlantic.
{DIALOGUE}: So my buddy's out of work and he can't afford to drive so he's got to walk to the job interviews which sucks 'cause the shrapnel in his ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids.
{DIALOGUE}: And meanwhile he's starvin' 'cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat the only blue-plate special they're servin' is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: So what'd I think?
{DIALOGUE}: I'm holdin' out for somethin' better.
{DIALOGUE}: I figure I'll eliminate the middle man.
{DIALOGUE}: Why not just shoot my buddy, take his job and give it to his sworn enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and join the National Guard?
{DIALOGUE}: Christ, I could be elected President.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SEAN
{DIALOGUE}: Do you think you're alone?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: What?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SEAN
{DIALOGUE}: Do you have a soul-mate?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SEAN
{DIALOGUE}: That's what I'm saying, Will.
{DIALOGUE}: You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, what?
{DIALOGUE}: You're going to take the professor's side on this?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SEAN
{DIALOGUE}: Don't give me your line of shit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't want the job.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SEAN
{DIALOGUE}: It's not about that job.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not saying you should work for the government.
{DIALOGUE}: But, you could do anything you want.
{DIALOGUE}: And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have.
{DIALOGUE}: What do you want to do?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't ask for this.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SEAN
{DIALOGUE}: Nobody gets what they ask for, Will.
{DIALOGUE}: That's a cop-out.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WILL
{DIALOGUE}: Why is it a cop-out?
{DIALOGUE}: I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'.
{DIALOGUE}: Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me.
{DIALOGUE}: There's honor in that.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SEAN
{DIALOGUE}: You're right, Will.
{DIALOGUE}: Any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man.

{DIALOGUE}: Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LAMBEAU
{DIALOGUE}: He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SEAN
{DIALOGUE}: Why is he hiding?
{DIALOGUE}: Why is he a janitor?
{DIALOGUE}: Why doesn't he trust anybody?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: LAMBEAU
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, come on, Sean--

{DIALOGUE}: It's called loyalty!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LAMBEAU
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, that's nice--

{DIALOGUE}: And who do you think he's handling?
{DIALOGUE}: He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him.
{DIALOGUE}: And for 20 years he's been alone because of that.
{DIALOGUE}: And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again.
{DIALOGUE}: And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LAMBEAU
{DIALOGUE}: Now don't do that.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't you do that!
{DIALOGUE}: Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: SEAN
{DIALOGUE}: --I'm not angry at you--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LAMBEAU
{DIALOGUE}: Yes you are, Sean.

{DIALOGUE}: --I don't have any anger at you--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LAMBEAU
{DIALOGUE}: Yes you do.
{DIALOGUE}: You're angry at me for doing what you could have done.
{DIALOGUE}: Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SEAN
{DIALOGUE}: That's it.
{DIALOGUE}: That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions!
{DIALOGUE}: Because I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me!
{DIALOGUE}: You think I'm a failure!
{DIALOGUE}: I know who I am.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm proud of who I am.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: LAMBEAU
{DIALOGUE}: That's right!
{DIALOGUE}: You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now!
{DIALOGUE}: So don't blame me for how your life turned out.
{DIALOGUE}: It's not my fault.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SEAN
{DIALOGUE}: I don't blame you!
{DIALOGUE}: It's not about that!
{DIALOGUE}: It's about the boy!
{DIALOGUE}: 'Cause he's a good kid!
{DIALOGUE}: And I won't see this happen to him- won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LAMBEAU
{DIALOGUE}: He won't be a failure!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SEAN
{DIALOGUE}: If you push him into something, if you ride him--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LAMBEAU
{DIALOGUE}: You're wrong, Sean.
