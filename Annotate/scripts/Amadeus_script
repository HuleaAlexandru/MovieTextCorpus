{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Total darkness.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We hear an old man's voice, distinct and in distress.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is OLD SALIERI.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He uses a mixture of English and occasionally Italian.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Mozart!
{DIALOGUE}: Mozart!
{DIALOGUE}: Mozart.
{DIALOGUE}: Forgive me!
{DIALOGUE}: Forgive your assassin!
{DIALOGUE}: Mozart!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A faint light illuminates the screen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Flickeringly, we see an eighteenth century balustrade and a flight of stone stairs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We are looking down into the wall of the staircase from the point of view of the landing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Up the stair is coming a branched candlestick held by Salieri's VALET.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: By his side is Salieri's COOK, bearing a large dish of sugared cakes and biscuits.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Both men are desperately worried: the Valet is thin and middle-aged; the Cook, plump and Italian.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is very cold.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They wear shawls over their night-dresses and clogs on their feet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They wheeze as they climb.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The candles throw their shadows up onto the peeling walls of the house, which is evidently an old one and in bad decay.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A cat scuttles swiftly between their bare legs, as they reach the salon door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Valet tries the handle.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is locked.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Behind it the voice goes on, rising in volume.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Show some mercy!
{DIALOGUE}: I beg you.
{DIALOGUE}: I beg you!
{DIALOGUE}: Show mercy to a guilty man!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Valet knocks gently on the door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The voice stops.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VALET
{DIALOGUE}: Open the door, Signore!
{DIALOGUE}: Please!
{DIALOGUE}: Be good now!

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Silence.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VALET
{DIALOGUE}: Signore Salieri!
{DIALOGUE}: Open the door.
{DIALOGUE}: Come now.
{DIALOGUE}: Be good!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The voice of Old Salieri continues again, further off now, and louder.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We hear a noise as if a window is being opened.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Mozart!
{DIALOGUE}: Mozart!
{DIALOGUE}: I confess it!
{DIALOGUE}: Listen!
{DIALOGUE}: I confess!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The two servants look at each other in alarm.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then the Valet hands the candlestick to the Cook and takes a sugared cake from the dish, scrambling as quickly as he can back down the stairs.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE SALIERI'S HOUSE - VIENNA - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The street is filled with people: ten cabs with drivers, five children, fifteen adults, two doormen, fifteen dancing couples and a sled and three dogs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is a windy night.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Snow is falling and whirling about.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: People are passing on foot, holding their cloaks tightly around them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Some of them are revelers in fancy dress: they wear masks on their faces or hanging around their necks, as if returning from parties.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now they are glancing up at the facade of the old house.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The window above the street is open and Old Salieri stands there calling to the sky: a sharp-featured, white-haired Italian over seventy years old, wearing a stained dressing gown.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Mozart!
{DIALOGUE}: Mozart!
{DIALOGUE}: I cannot bear it any longer!
{DIALOGUE}: I confess!

{DIALOGUE}: I'm guilty!
{DIALOGUE}: I killed you!
{DIALOGUE}: Sir I confess!
{DIALOGUE}: I killed you!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The door of the house bursts open.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Valet hobbles out, holding the sugared cake.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: VALET
{META_DATA}: (looking up to the window)
{DIALOGUE}: That's all right, Signore!
{DIALOGUE}: He heard you!
{DIALOGUE}: He forgave you!
{DIALOGUE}: He wants you to go inside now and shut the window!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Old Salieri stares down at him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Some of the passersby have now stopped and are watching this spectacle.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VALET
{DIALOGUE}: Come on, Signore!
{DIALOGUE}: Look what I have for you!
{DIALOGUE}: I can't give it to you from down here, can I?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Old Salieri looks at him in contempt.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he turns away back into the room, shutting the window with a bang.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Through the glass, the old man stares down at the group of onlookers in the street.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They stare back at him in confusion.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BYSTANDER
{DIALOGUE}: Who is that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VALET
{DIALOGUE}: No one, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: He'll be all right.
{DIALOGUE}: Poor man.
{DIALOGUE}: He's a little unhappy, you know.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Valet again knocks on the door.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VALET
{DIALOGUE}: Here I am, Signore.
{DIALOGUE}: Now open the door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He eats the sugared cake in his hand, elaborately and noisily.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VALET
{DIALOGUE}: Mmmm - this is good!
{DIALOGUE}: This is the most delicious thing I ever ate, believe me!
{DIALOGUE}: Signore, you don't know what you're missing!
{DIALOGUE}: Mmmm!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We hear a thump from inside the bedroom.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VALET
{DIALOGUE}: Now that's enough, Signore!
{DIALOGUE}: Open!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We hear a terrible, throaty groaning.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VALET
{DIALOGUE}: If you don't open this door, we're going to eat everything.
{DIALOGUE}: There'll be nothing left for you.
{DIALOGUE}: And I'm not going to bring you anything more.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks down.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: From under the door we see a trickle of blood flowing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In horror, the two men stare at it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The dish of cakes falls from the Cook's hand and shatters.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He sets the candlestick down on the floor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Both servants run at the door frantically - once, twice, three times - and the frail lock gives.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The door flies open.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Immediately, the stormy, frenzied opening of Mozart's Symphony No. 25 (the Little G Minor) begins.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see what the servants see.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. OLD SALIERI'S SALON - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Old Salieri lies on the floor in a pool of blood, an open razor in his hand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He has cut his throat but is still alive.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He gestures at them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They run to him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Barely, we glimpse the room - an old chair, old tables piled with books, a forte- piano, a chamber-pot on the floor - as the Valet and the Cook struggle to lift their old Master, and bind his bleeding throat with a napkin.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Twenty-five dancing couples, fifty guests, ten servants, full orchestra.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the music slows a little, we see a Masquerade Ball in progress.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All patients wear white linen smocks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Doctor Gulden wears a dark frock-coat; Vogler, a cassock.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: DOCTOR GULDEN
{DIALOGUE}: Here we are.
{DIALOGUE}: Do you wish me to come in with you?

{DIALOGUE}: You tried to take your life.
{DIALOGUE}: You do remember that, don't you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: So?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VOGLER
{DIALOGUE}: In the sight of God that is a sin.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: What do you want?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VOGLER
{DIALOGUE}: Do you understand that you have sinned?
{DIALOGUE}: Gravely.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Leave me alone.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VOGLER
{DIALOGUE}: I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know who I am?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Are they?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VOGLER
{DIALOGUE}: Offer me your confession.
{DIALOGUE}: I can offer you God's forgiveness.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI

{DIALOGUE}: Unburden it to me.

{DIALOGUE}: Please talk to me.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI

{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Then you must know this.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: VOGLER
{DIALOGUE}: I can't say I do.
{DIALOGUE}: What is it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: I'm surprised you don't know.

{DIALOGUE}: I wrote it.

{DIALOGUE}: Well?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VOGLER
{DIALOGUE}: I regret it is not too familiar.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Can you recall no melody of mine?
{DIALOGUE}: I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy.
{DIALOGUE}: I wrote forty operas alone.
{DIALOGUE}: What about this little thing?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Slyly he plays the opening measure of Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The priest nods, smiling suddenly, and hums a little with the music.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VOGLER
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, I know that!
{DIALOGUE}: That's charming!
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't know you wrote that.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't.
{DIALOGUE}: That was Mozart.
{DIALOGUE}: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
{DIALOGUE}: You know who that is?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VOGLER
{DIALOGUE}: Of course.
{DIALOGUE}: The man you accuse yourself of killing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Ah - you've heard that?

{DIALOGUE}: All Vienna has heard that.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{META_DATA}: ( eagerly)

{CHARACTER_NAME}: VOGLER
{DIALOGUE}: Is it true?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Do you believe it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VOGLER
{DIALOGUE}: Should I?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A very long pause.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Salieri stares above the priest, seemingly lost in his own private world.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VOGLER
{DIALOGUE}: For God's sake, my son, if you have anything to confess, do it now!
{DIALOGUE}: Give yourself some peace!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A further pause.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VOGLER
{DIALOGUE}: Do you hear me?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: He was murdered, Father!
{DIALOGUE}: Mozart!
{DIALOGUE}: Cruelly murdered.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Pause.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VOGLER
{META_DATA}: (almost whispering)
{DIALOGUE}: Yes?
{DIALOGUE}: Did you do it?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly Old Salieri turns to him, a look of extreme innocence.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: He was my idol!
{DIALOGUE}: I can't remember a time when I didn't know his name!
{DIALOGUE}: When I was only fourteen he was already famous.
{DIALOGUE}: Even in Legnago - the tiniest town in Italy - I knew of him.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. A SMALL TOWN SQUARE IN LOMBARDY, ITALY - DAY - 1780'S
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There are twelve children and twenty adults in the square.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: I admit I was jealous when I heard the tales they told about him.
{DIALOGUE}: Not of the brilliant little prodigy himself, but of his father, who had taught him everything.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The piece finishes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leopold lowers the lid of the harpsichord and lifts up his little son to stand on it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart removes the blindfold to show a pale little face with staring eyes.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A Papal Chamberlain presents Leopold with a gold snuff box whilst the cardinals decorously applaud.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Over this scene Old Salieri speaks.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)

{DIALOGUE}: He wanted me only to be a merchant, like himself.
{DIALOGUE}: As anonymous as he was.
{DIALOGUE}: When I told how I wished I could be like Mozart, he would say, Why?
{DIALOGUE}: Do you want to be a trained monkey?
{DIALOGUE}: Would you like me to drag you around Europe doing tricks like a circus freak?
{DIALOGUE}: How could I tell him what music meant to me?

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see the twelve-year-old Salieri seated between his plump and placid parents in the congregation, listening in rapture.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A large and austere Christ on the cross hangs over the altar.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: So do his parents and the other members of the congregation.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stares up at Christ who stares back at him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Whilst my father prayed earnestly to God to protect commerce, I would offer up secretly the proudest prayer a boy could think of.
{DIALOGUE}: Lord, make me a great composer!
{DIALOGUE}: Let me celebrate your glory through music - and be celebrated myself!
{DIALOGUE}: Make me famous through the world, dear God!
{DIALOGUE}: Make me immortal!
{DIALOGUE}: After I die let people speak my name forever with love for what I wrote!

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All the women get up and crowd around him, thumping and pummeling him, but it is in vain.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Father Salieri collapses.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON - 1823
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Suddenly he was dead.
{DIALOGUE}: Just like that!
{DIALOGUE}: And my life changed forever.
{DIALOGUE}: My mother said, Go.
{DIALOGUE}: Study music if you really want to.
{DIALOGUE}: Off with you!
{DIALOGUE}: And off I went as quick as I could and never saw Italy again.
{DIALOGUE}: Of course, I knew God had arranged it all; that was obvious.
{DIALOGUE}: One moment I was a frustrated boy in an obscure little town.
{DIALOGUE}: The next I was here, in Vienna, city of musicians, sixteen years old and studying under Gluck!
{DIALOGUE}: Gluck, Father.
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know who he was?
{DIALOGUE}: The greatest composer of his time.
{DIALOGUE}: And he loved me!
{DIALOGUE}: That was the wonder.
{DIALOGUE}: He taught me everything he knew.
{DIALOGUE}: And when I was ready, introduced me personally to the Emperor!
{DIALOGUE}: Emperor Joseph - the musical king!
{DIALOGUE}: Within a few years I was his court composer.
{DIALOGUE}: Wasn't that incredible?
{DIALOGUE}: Imperial Composer to His Majesty!
{DIALOGUE}: Actually the man had no ear at all, but what did it matter?
{DIALOGUE}: He adored my music, that was enough.
{DIALOGUE}: Night after night I sat right next to the Emperor of Austria, playing duets with him, correcting the royal sight-reading.
{DIALOGUE}: Tell me, if you had been me, wouldn't you have thought God had accepted your vow?
{DIALOGUE}: And believe me, I honoured it.
{DIALOGUE}: I was a model of virtue.
{DIALOGUE}: I kept my hands off women, worked hours every day teaching students, many of them for free, sitting on endless committees to help poor musicians - work and work and work, that was all my life.
{DIALOGUE}: And it was wonderful!
{DIALOGUE}: Everybody liked me.
{DIALOGUE}: I liked myself.
{DIALOGUE}: I was the most successful musician in Vienna.
{DIALOGUE}: And the happiest.
{DIALOGUE}: Till he came.
{DIALOGUE}: Mozart.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We follow him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: As I went through the salon, I played a game with myself.
{DIALOGUE}: This man had written his first concerto at the age of four; his first symphony at seven; a full-scale opera at twelve.
{DIALOGUE}: Did it show?
{DIALOGUE}: Is talent like that written on the face?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see shots of assorted young men staring back at Salieri as he moves through the crowd.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Which one of them could he be?

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After a beat of total silence, MOZART runs into the room, stops, and looks around.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is age twenty-six, wearing a fine wig and a brilliant coat with the insignia of the Archbishop of Salzburg upon it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is puzzled; Constanze has disappeared.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Baffled, he turns and is about to leave the room, when Constanze suddenly squeaks from under the cloth like a tiny mouse.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Instantly Mozart drops to all fours and starts crawling across the floor, meowing and hissing like a naughty cat.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A group of people who have attended the concert, among them Constanze, are standing outside the private apartment.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At sight of the composer they break into sustained applause.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart is suddenly delighted.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He throws the door wide open
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: so that the guests can see into the private apartment where the Archbishop sits - and he can see them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Colloredo is clearly discomfited by this reception of his employee.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He smiles and bows uneasily, as they include him in the small ovation.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart stands in the corridor, out of the Archbishop's line of sight, bowing and giggling, and encouraging the applause for the Archbishop with conducting gestures.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Salieri, in this vast room, is standing and looking at the full score of the Serenade.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns the pages back to the slow movement.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Instantly, we again hear its lyrical strains.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CU, Salieri, reading the score of the Adagio in helpless fascination.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The music is played against his description of it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Extraordinary!
{DIALOGUE}: On the page it looked nothing.
{DIALOGUE}: The beginning simple, almost comic.
{DIALOGUE}: Just a pulse - bassoons and basset horns - like a rusty squeezebox.
{DIALOGUE}: Then suddenly - high above it - an oboe, a single note, hanging there unwavering, till a clarinet took over and sweetened it into a phrase of such delight!
{DIALOGUE}: This was no composition by a performing monkey!
{DIALOGUE}: This was a music I'd never heard.
{DIALOGUE}: Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing, it had me trembling.
{DIALOGUE}: It seemed to me that I was hearing a voice of God.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly the music snaps off.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart stands before him as he lays down the score.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Excuse me!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes the score, bows, and struts briskly out of the room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Salieri stares uncomprehendingly after the jaunty little figure.

{DIALOGUE}: But why?
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1823
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Why?
{DIALOGUE}: Would God choose an obscene child to be His instrument?
{DIALOGUE}: It was not to be believed!
{DIALOGUE}: This piece had to be an accident.
{DIALOGUE}: It had to be!

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: BARON VON SWIETEN, the Imperial Librarian: a grave but kindly and educated man in his mid-fifties.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: FIRST KAPELLMEISTER GIUSEPPE BONNO: very Italian, cringing and time-serving, aged about seventy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And Salieri, wearing decorous black, as usual.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At a side-table, two Imperial secretaries, using quill pens and inkstands, write down everything of importance that is said.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPH
{DIALOGUE}: How good is he, this Mozart?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VON SWIETEN
{DIALOGUE}: He's remarkable, Majesty.
{DIALOGUE}: I heard an extraordinary serious opera of his last month.
{DIALOGUE}: Idomeneo, King of Crete.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
{DIALOGUE}: That?
{DIALOGUE}: A most tiresome piece.
{DIALOGUE}: I heard it, too.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VON SWIETEN
{DIALOGUE}: Tiresome?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
{DIALOGUE}: A young man trying to impress beyond his abilities.
{DIALOGUE}: Too much spice.
{DIALOGUE}: Too many notes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VON SWIETEN
{DIALOGUE}: Majesty, I thought it the most promising work I've heard in years.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPH
{DIALOGUE}: Ah-ha.
{DIALOGUE}: Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him.
{DIALOGUE}: We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VON STRACK
{DIALOGUE}: I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible.
{DIALOGUE}: The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPH
{DIALOGUE}: Very small pay, I imagine.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer.
{DIALOGUE}: Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VON SWIETEN
{DIALOGUE}: Excellent, sire!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
{DIALOGUE}: But not German, I beg your Majesty!
{DIALOGUE}: Italian is the proper language for opera.
{DIALOGUE}: All educated people agree on that.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPH
{DIALOGUE}: Ah-ha.
{DIALOGUE}: What do you say, Chamberlain?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VON STRACK
{DIALOGUE}: In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: Plain German.
{DIALOGUE}: For plain people.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks defiantly at Orsini-Rosenberg.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPH
{DIALOGUE}: Ah-ha.
{DIALOGUE}: Kapellmeister?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BONNO
{META_DATA}: (Italian accent)
{DIALOGUE}: Majesty, I must agree with Herr Dirretore.
{DIALOGUE}: Opera is an Italian art, solamente.
{DIALOGUE}: German is - scusate - too bruta for singing, too rough.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPH
{DIALOGUE}: Ah-ha.
{DIALOGUE}: Court Composer, what do you say?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty.
{DIALOGUE}: It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPH
{DIALOGUE}: You are cattivo, Court Composer.
{META_DATA}: (briskly, to Von Strack)
{DIALOGUE}: I want to meet this young man.
{DIALOGUE}: Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VON STRACK
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, sir.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPH

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Opposite this image sits Salieri at his desk, on which stands a pile of music paper, quill pens and ink.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On one side of him is an open forte-piano on which he occasionally tries notes from the march he is composing, with some difficulty.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He scratches notes out with his quill, and ruffles his hair - which we see without a powdered wig.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is a knock at the door.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Si.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A servant admits LORL, a young lower-class girl, who appears carrying a basket in which is a box covered with a napkin.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. A WIGMAKER'S SHOP - VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The march continues on the forte-piano as we see Mozart, seated in front of a mirror, wearing an extravagant wig.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On either side of him stands a SALESMAN, one of them holding another wig, equally extravagant.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart takes off the first wig, to reveal his own blonde hair, of which he is extremely proud, and hands it back.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: And the other one?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Salesman puts the second wig on his head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart pulls a face of doubt in the mirror.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: And the other one?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes it off and the other Salesman replaces it with the first wig on his head.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, they're both so beautiful, I can't decide.
{DIALOGUE}: Why don't I have two heads?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He giggles.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPH
{DIALOGUE}: What a charming idea.
{DIALOGUE}: May I see?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPH
{DIALOGUE}: Delightful, Court Composer.
{DIALOGUE}: Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SALIERI

{DIALOGUE}: Let's have some fun.

{META_DATA}: (to the others)
{DIALOGUE}: He was giving the most brilliant little concert here.
{DIALOGUE}: As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Italian faction - Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno - laugh discreetly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: No, I don't think you do.
{DIALOGUE}: I mean watching Italian opera, all those male sopranos screeching.
{DIALOGUE}: Stupid fat couples rolling their eyes about!
{DIALOGUE}: That's not love - it's just rubbish.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An embarrassed pause.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bonno giggles in nervous amusement.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart plays the first half of the march with deadly accuracy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{META_DATA}: (to Salieri)
{DIALOGUE}: The rest is just the same, isn't it?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He plays the first half again but stops in the middle of a phrase, which he repeats dubiously.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: That really doesn't work, does it?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All the courtiers look at Salieri.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Did you try this?
{DIALOGUE}: Wouldn't it be just a little more -?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Oh?
{DIALOGUE}: News travels fast in Vienna.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CAVALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: And he's been commissioned to write an opera.
{DIALOGUE}: Is it true?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CAVALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Is there a part for me?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CAVALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: How do you know?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CAVALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Why not?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CAVALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Where?

{DIALOGUE}: Turkish?
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: You might be disappointed.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CAVALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Why?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CAVALIERI
{META_DATA}: (airily)
{DIALOGUE}: Looks don't concern me, Maestro.
{DIALOGUE}: Only talent interests a woman of taste.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He strikes the chord again, firmly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cavalieri sings her next scale, then another one, and another one, doing her exercises in earnest.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As she hits a sustained high note the orchestral accompaniment in the middle of Martern Aller Arten from Il Seraglio comes in underneath and the music changes from exercises to the exceedingly florid aria.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After a few moments of this showy aria, with the composer and the singer staring at each other - he conducting elaborately for her benefit, and she following his beat with rapturous eyes - the music fades, and Salieri speaks over it.

{DIALOGUE}: There she was.
{DIALOGUE}: I had no idea where they met - or how - yet there she stood on stage for all to see.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Did you like it, then?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: How could I not?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't you agree?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CAVALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Is she a good fuck?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: What??
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CAVALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: I assume she's the virtuoso in that department.
{DIALOGUE}: There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: CAVALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Come in!

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Excuse us, Fraulein.
{DIALOGUE}: Good night, Signore.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart hurries Constanze out of the door.

{DIALOGUE}: The Creature had had my darling girl.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1820'S
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The old man speaks passionately to the priest.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: It was incomprehensible.
{DIALOGUE}: What was God up to?
{DIALOGUE}: Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married!
{DIALOGUE}: - and no rebuke at all!
{DIALOGUE}: Was it possible I was being tested?
{DIALOGUE}: Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful?
{DIALOGUE}: That was very possible.
{DIALOGUE}: All the same, why him?
{DIALOGUE}: Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility?
{DIALOGUE}: My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man.
{DIALOGUE}: For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts.
{DIALOGUE}: I couldn't stop them.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see Leopold kneeling now not to the Cross but to Archbishop Colloredo, sitting impassively on his throne.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Count Arco stands beside him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leopold is a desperate, once-handsome man of sixty, now far too much the subservient courtier.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COLLOREDO
{DIALOGUE}: No!
{DIALOGUE}: I won't have him back.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: Oh sir, yes!
{DIALOGUE}: He's about to make the worst mistake of his life.
{DIALOGUE}: Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage.
{DIALOGUE}: I know my son.
{DIALOGUE}: He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COLLOREDO
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not surprised.
{DIALOGUE}: Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship.
{DIALOGUE}: He has sold himself to Vienna.
{DIALOGUE}: Let Vienna look out for him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: Sir -
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COLLOREDO
{DIALOGUE}: Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, sir, that's the truth.
{DIALOGUE}: But don't blame him.
{DIALOGUE}: The fault is mine.
{DIALOGUE}: I was too indulgent with him.
{DIALOGUE}: But not again.
{DIALOGUE}: Never again, I promise!
{DIALOGUE}: I implore you - let me bring him back here.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COLLOREDO
{DIALOGUE}: And how will you make him keep it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything.
{DIALOGUE}: Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COLLOREDO
{DIALOGUE}: You have leave to try.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace!
{DIALOGUE}: I thank you!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In deepest gratitude he kisses the Archbishop's hand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He motions Leopold to rise.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We hear the first dark fortissimo chord which begins the Overture to Don Giovanni: the theme associated with the character of the Commendatore.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD (V.O.)

{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: I write to you with urgent news.
{DIALOGUE}: I am coming to Vienna.
{DIALOGUE}: Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet.
{DIALOGUE}: You are too gullible to see your own danger.
{DIALOGUE}: As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: I will.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The camera pulls back to see that he is in fact kneeling beside Constanze.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A PRIEST faces them.

{DIALOGUE}: And will you, Constanze Weber, take this man, Wolfgang to be your lawful husband?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CONSTANZE

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is a view of a castle in background.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leopold sits alone in his room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is reading a letter from Wolfgang.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At his feet are his trunks, half-packed for the journey he will not now take.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We hear Mozart's voice reading the following letter and we see, as the camera roves around the room, mementos of the young prodigy's early life: the little forte-piano made for him; the little violin made for him; an Order presented to him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see a little starling in a wicker cage.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And we see portraits of the boy on the walls, concluding with the familiar family portrait of Wolfgang and his sister Nannerl seated at the keyboard with Leopold standing, and the picture of their mother on the wall behind them.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Most beloved father, it is done.
{DIALOGUE}: Do not blame me that I did not wait to see your dear face.
{DIALOGUE}: I knew you would have tried to dissuade me from my truest happiness and I could not have borne it.
{DIALOGUE}: Your every word is precious to me.
{DIALOGUE}: Remember how you have always told me Vienna is the City of Musicians.
{DIALOGUE}: To conquer here is to conquer Europe!
{DIALOGUE}: With my wife I can do it.
{DIALOGUE}: I vow I will become regular in my habits and productive as never before.
{DIALOGUE}: She is wonderful, Papa, and I know that you will love her.
{DIALOGUE}: And one day soon when I am a wealthy man, you will come and live with us, and we will be so happy.
{DIALOGUE}: I long for that day, best of Papas, and kiss your hand a hundred thousand times.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The music of the Mass fades as Leopold crumples the letter in his hand.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. THE IMPERIAL GARDENS - VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Salieri stands waiting, hat in hand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beside him stands a royal servant.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Behind him, gardeners are glimpsed tending the shrubs and bushes along a grassy ride.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Down this ride are seen cantering two people on horseback: the Emperor Joseph and his niece, the PRINCESS ELIZABETH.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are mounted on glossy horses.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Princess rides side-saddle.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Running beside her is a panting groom.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Emperor rides elegantly; his niece, a dumpy little Hapsburg girl of sixteen, like a sack of potatoes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As they draw level with Salieri they stop, and the groom holds the head of the Princess' horse.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Salieri bows respectfully.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPH

{DIALOGUE}: I think I've come up with an excellent idea.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He smiles at Salieri.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPH
{DIALOGUE}: I'm thinking about Herr Mozart.
{DIALOGUE}: What is your view?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Salieri's face falls, almost imperceptibly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: An interesting idea, Majesty.
{DIALOGUE}: But -
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPH
{DIALOGUE}: Yes?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPH
{DIALOGUE}: And the result satisfies.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, of course.
{DIALOGUE}: My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPH
{DIALOGUE}: Ah-ha.
{DIALOGUE}: Favouritism.
{DIALOGUE}: But I so want Mozart.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: I'm sure there is a way, Majesty.
{DIALOGUE}: Some kind of a little contest.
{DIALOGUE}: I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPH
{DIALOGUE}: You please me, Court Composer.
{DIALOGUE}: A very clever idea.

{DIALOGUE}: Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VON STRACK
{DIALOGUE}: Because His Majesty wishes it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Is the Emperor angry with me?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VON STRACK
{DIALOGUE}: On the contrary.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VON STRACK
{DIALOGUE}: Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: No, but I'm the best.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VON STRACK
{DIALOGUE}: A little modesty would suit you better.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART

{DIALOGUE}: Mozart -
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART

{DIALOGUE}: Displace one note and there would be diminishment.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The music swells.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: What we now hear is an amazing collage of great passages from Mozart's music, ravishing to Salieri and to us.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Court Composer, oblivious to Constanze, who sits happily chewing chestnuts, her mouth covered in sugar, walks around and around his salon, reading the pages and dropping them on the floor when he is done with them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see his agonized and wondering face: he shudders as if in a rough and tumbling sea; he experiences the point where beauty and great pain coalesce.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: More pages fall than he can read, scattering across the floor in a white cascade, as he circles the room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Finally, we hear the tremendous Qui Tollis from the Mass in C Minor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It seems to break over him like a wave and, unable to bear any more of it, he slams the portfolio shut.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: GERTRUDE
{DIALOGUE}: But you are here.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCHLUMBERG
{DIALOGUE}: Never mind, Strudel.
{DIALOGUE}: It's part of music, getting used to an audience.
{DIALOGUE}: Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Well, yes!
{DIALOGUE}: on the whole.
{DIALOGUE}: I suppose.
{META_DATA}: (to Gertrude)
{DIALOGUE}: How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FRAU SCHLUMBERG
{DIALOGUE}: Just one year.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Who was your teacher?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FRAU SCHLUMBERG
{DIALOGUE}: I was.
{DIALOGUE}: But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Thank you, Madame.
{META_DATA}: (to Gertrude)
{DIALOGUE}: Come on now - courage.
{DIALOGUE}: Play me something you know.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In response the wretched girl just stares down at the keyboard without playing a note.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An awkward pause.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Perhaps it would be better if we were left alone.
{DIALOGUE}: I think we're both a little shy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Husband and wife look at each other.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCHLUMBERG
{DIALOGUE}: Nonsense.
{DIALOGUE}: Strudel's not shy.
{DIALOGUE}: She's just willful!
{DIALOGUE}: You give into her now, you'll be sorry later.
{DIALOGUE}: Strudel - play.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Silence.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The girl sits unmoving.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Schlumberg bellows:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCHLUMBERG
{DIALOGUE}: I said play!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FRAU SCHLUMBERG
{DIALOGUE}: Michael!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Perhaps if I were to play a little first, it might encourage the Fraulein.
{META_DATA}: (to the girl)
{DIALOGUE}: Why don't you let me try the instrument?
{DIALOGUE}: All right?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly the girl rises.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart smiles at the parents.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They smile nervously back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart slides along the bench, raises his hands and preludes over the keys.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Instantly a dog howls loudly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Startled, Mozart stops.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Schlumberg leaps to his feet and goes over to the beagle.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCHLUMBERG
{DIALOGUE}: Stop that, Dudelsachs!
{DIALOGUE}: Stop it at once!
{META_DATA}: (to Mozart)
{DIALOGUE}: Don't let him disturb you.
{DIALOGUE}: He'll be all right.
{DIALOGUE}: He's just a little willful too.
{DIALOGUE}: Please, please - play.
{DIALOGUE}: I beg you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart resumes playing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This time it is a lively piece, perhaps the Presto Finale from the K. 450.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The dog howls immediately.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCHLUMBERG
{DIALOGUE}: Stop it!
{DIALOGUE}: STOP!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart stops.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCHLUMBERG
{DIALOGUE}: No, not you.
{DIALOGUE}: I was talking to the dog.
{DIALOGUE}: You keep playing.
{DIALOGUE}: It's most important.
{DIALOGUE}: He always howls when he hears music.
{DIALOGUE}: We've got to break them of the habit.
{DIALOGUE}: Play, please.
{DIALOGUE}: Please!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Amazed, Mozart starts to play the Rondo again.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The dog howls louder.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCHLUMBERG
{DIALOGUE}: That's it.
{DIALOGUE}: Now keep going, just keep going.
{META_DATA}: (to the beagle)
{DIALOGUE}: Now you stop that noise, Dudelsachs, you stop it this instant!
{DIALOGUE}: This instant, do you hear me?
{DIALOGUE}: Keep going, Herr Mozart, that's it.
{DIALOGUE}: Go on, go on!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart plays on.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly the dog falls silent.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Schlumberg smiles broadly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCHLUMBERG
{DIALOGUE}: Good, good, good!
{DIALOGUE}: Very good dog!
{DIALOGUE}: Very, very good Dudelsachs.
{META_DATA}: (to his wife, snapping his fingers)
{DIALOGUE}: Quick, quick, dear, bring his biscuit.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The wife scurries to get a jar of biscuits.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A servant brings in an open bottle of wine and a full glass on a tray.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He puts it down beside Mozart as Schlumberg addresses the silent dog with deepest affection.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCHLUMBERG
{DIALOGUE}: Now guess who's going to get a nice reward?
{DIALOGUE}: Clever, clever Dudi.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He gives the biscuit to the dog who swallows it greedily.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart stops playing and stands up.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCHLUMBERG
{DIALOGUE}: It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{META_DATA}: (barely controlling himself)
{DIALOGUE}: Well, I'm a good teacher.
{DIALOGUE}: The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know.
{DIALOGUE}: Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame!
{DIALOGUE}: goodbye, Sir!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He bows to them and leaves the room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They look after him in puzzled astonishment.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FRAU SCHLUMBERG
{DIALOGUE}: What a strange young man.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCHLUMBERG
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{DIALOGUE}: He is a little strange.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. A BUSY STREET IN VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A cheerful scene.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see Mozart strutting and beaming, making his way through the crowd of porters, carriers and hawkers, sellers of sausages and pastries, vendors of hats and ribbons.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Horses and carriage clatter past him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His mood is best expressed by a bubbling version of Non piu Andrai played on the forte-piano.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Still in the same mood, he enters the door of his own house.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. MOZART'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY - 1780'S
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, he stops.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks up the stairs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The grim opening chords from the Overture to Don Giovanni cut across the march from Figaro.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: What he sees, looking up the stairs, is a menacing figure in a long, grey cape and dark grey hat, standing on the landing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The light comes from behind the figure so that we see only its silhouette as it unfolds its arms towards Mozart in an alarming gesture of possession.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It takes a beat in which the air of sinister mystery is held before Mozart realizes who it is.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, as the music continues, he hastily sets down the bottle of wine and rushes joyfully up the stairs and hurls himself into the figure's arms.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Papa!
{DIALOGUE}: PAPA!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Both men embrace.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The music slowly fades.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. MOZART'S LIVING ROOM - DAY - 1780'S
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A cramped, low-ceilinged little room which nobody has tidied for ages.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see music lying everywhere.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Also there are many empty wine bottles; musical instruments - among them a mandolin, a viola, a forte-piano with the black and white keys reversed - books and abandoned plates of food.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart clasps his father's arms.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leopold is now seen as an aging, travel-stained man in clothes that need repair.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His face is lined, and he is obviously not in perfect health.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Why are you here?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: Am I not welcome?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Of course, welcome!
{DIALOGUE}: Welcome ten thousand times.
{DIALOGUE}: Papa!
{DIALOGUE}: my Papa!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He kisses his hands.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: You're very thin.
{DIALOGUE}: Does she not feed you, this wife of yours?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart ducks away and fetches his father's bags from the landing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Feed?
{DIALOGUE}: Well, of course she feeds me.
{DIALOGUE}: She stuffs me like a goose all day long.
{DIALOGUE}: She's the best cook in the world.
{DIALOGUE}: I mean, since Mama.
{DIALOGUE}: Just wait, you'll see.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: Is she not here?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{DIALOGUE}: Stanzi?
{DIALOGUE}: Stanzi!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leopold looks about him at the mess in the room.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: Do you always live like this?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, yes.
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this.
{DIALOGUE}: I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now.
{DIALOGUE}: She had to go - yes!
{DIALOGUE}: She had to help her mother.
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, she's like that.
{DIALOGUE}: Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He carries the bag across the room and opens the door of the bedroom.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Constanze lies in bed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She sits up, startled.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Oh!
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't know you were home.
{DIALOGUE}: Stanzi, this is my father.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Constanze, who looks ill and tired, stares at Leopold.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leopold stares back from the doorway.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: We'll wait, we'll wait.
{DIALOGUE}: Why don't you get up now, darling?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He closes the door again.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: She's very tired, poor creature.
{DIALOGUE}: You know me: I'm a real pig.
{DIALOGUE}: It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: Don't you have a maid?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it.
{DIALOGUE}: She wants to do everything herself.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: How is your financial situation?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: It couldn't be better.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: That's not what I hear.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: What do you mean?
{DIALOGUE}: It's wonderful.
{DIALOGUE}: Really, it's - it's marvelous!
{DIALOGUE}: People love me here.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: They say you're in debt.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Who?
{DIALOGUE}: Who says that?
{DIALOGUE}: Now that's a malicious lie!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: How many pupils do you have?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Pupils?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: How many?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{DIALOGUE}: It's not important.
{DIALOGUE}: I mean, I don't want pupils.
{DIALOGUE}: They get in the way.
{DIALOGUE}: I've got to have time for composition.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: Composition doesn't pay.
{DIALOGUE}: You know that.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: This one will.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He picks up some pages of manuscript.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: What's that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, let's not talk about it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: Why not?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: It's a secret.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: You don't have secrets from me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: It's too dangerous, Papa.
{DIALOGUE}: But they're going to love it.
{DIALOGUE}: Ah, there she is!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Constanze comes into the room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She is wearing a dressing gown and has made a perfunctory attempt to tidy her hair.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see that she is clearly pregnant.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: My Stanzi - look at her!
{DIALOGUE}: Isn't she beautiful?
{DIALOGUE}: Come on now, confess, Papa.
{DIALOGUE}: Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CONSTANZE
{DIALOGUE}: Stop it, Wolfi.
{DIALOGUE}: I look dreadful.
{DIALOGUE}: Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: He's not Herr Mozart.
{DIALOGUE}: Call him Papa.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: I see that you're expecting.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CONSTANZE
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, yes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: When, may I ask?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CONSTANZE
{DIALOGUE}: In three months!
{DIALOGUE}: Papa.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Isn't that marvelous?
{DIALOGUE}: We're delighted.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Didn't I?
{DIALOGUE}: I thought I did.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm sure I did.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He gives a little giggle of embarrassment.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CONSTANZE
{DIALOGUE}: May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Tea?
{DIALOGUE}: Who wants tea?
{DIALOGUE}: Let's go out!
{DIALOGUE}: This calls for a feast.
{DIALOGUE}: You don't want tea, Papa.
{DIALOGUE}: Let's go dancing.
{DIALOGUE}: Papa loves parties, don't you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CONSTANZE
{DIALOGUE}: Wolfi!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: What?
{DIALOGUE}: How can you be so boring?
{DIALOGUE}: Tea!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CONSTANZE
{DIALOGUE}: Wolfi, I think your father's tired.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll cook us something here.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: Thank you.
{DIALOGUE}: That'll be fine.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't spend any money on me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Why not?
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, come, Papa!
{DIALOGUE}: What better way could I spend it than on you?
{DIALOGUE}: My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The jaunty tune of Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein (K.539) sounds through all the following.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is an alternate song from Il Seraglio: a very extroverted tune for baritone and orchestra and a prominent part for bass drum.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The vocal part should be arranged for trumpet.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. STREET IN VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart and Constanze with Leopold between them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see couples shopping.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. A COSTUME SHOP - VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is a shop where one can buy costumes for masquerades.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is filled with extravagant costumes of various kinds.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wolfgang is wearing a costume, a mask pushed up on his forehead; Constanze is wearing a little white velvet mask.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Amidst the merriment, Leopold is helped by two assistants to put on a dark grey cloak and a dark grey tricorne hat, to which is attached a full mask of dark grey.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Its mouth is cut into a fixed upward smile.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns and looks at his son through this mask.
{META_DATA}: CUT STRAIGHT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. A LARGE PARTY ROOM - VIENNA - NIGHT - 1780'S
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We are in the full whirl of a Masquerade Ball.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Couples are dancing around dressed in fantastic costumes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The music of Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein increases in volume and persists.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see the musicians thumping it out on a balustrade above the dancers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A steer is being roasted.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Through the bobbing crowd we see a group, headed by the figure of Bacchus: this is Schikaneder in a Greek costume, wearing vine leaves in his hair.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is accompanied by his usual trio of actresses and three other men.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Constanze as Columbine and Mozart as Harlequin are pulling Leopold by the hand of his dark cloak and smiling mask.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This whole group threads its way across the crowded room and disappears through a door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As they go, they are watched by Salieri, standing alone in a corner, wearing ordinary evening clothes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns away hastily to avoid being seen by them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As soon as they disappear into the far room, Salieri goes quickly to a lady in the corner who is giving guests domino masks off a tray.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He quickly takes a small black mask and puts it on.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. A GROTTO ROOM NEXT DOOR - NIGHT - 1780'S
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A fantastic room designed as a rocky grotto, lit by candles.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A forte-piano to one side is being played by Schikaneder: the music of Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein cross-fades to another tune.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is Vivat Bacchus from Il Seraglio which
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Schikaneder, dressed as Bacchus, is humming as he plays.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The music is actually accompanying a game of Forfeits, which has begun.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Five couples (the group we have just seen) are dancing in the middle of a ring made by nine chairs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When the music stops they will each have to find a chair, and the one who fails must pay a forfeit.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Constanze is dancing with Leopold; Mozart is dancing with one of the actresses; the two other actresses are dancing with two other gentlemen; and two children dance together - a little boy and a little girl.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The scene is watched by a circle of bystanders; among them - from the doorway - is Salieri.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Schikaneder stops playing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Immediately the couples scramble for the chairs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leopold and Constanze meet on the same chair, bumping and pushing at each other to get sole possession of it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: To the amusement of the people around, the chair over- balances and they both end up on the floor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Constanze immediately gets up again, sets the chair on its feet, and tries to pretend she was sitting in it all the time.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But Schikaneder calls out from the forte-piano.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCHIKANEDER
{DIALOGUE}: No, no!
{DIALOGUE}: You both lost.
{DIALOGUE}: You both lost.
{DIALOGUE}: You both have to forfeit.
{DIALOGUE}: And the penalty is you must exchange your wigs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: People are delighted by the idea of this penalty.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The children jump up and down with excitement.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The three actresses immediately surround Leopold, reaching for his hat and mask and wig, whilst he tries to hold on to them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart takes off Constanze's wig - an absurd affair with side-curls.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Constanze laughingly surrenders it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: No, please!
{DIALOGUE}: This is ridiculous!
{DIALOGUE}: No, please!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Despite his protests an actress takes off his hat, to which the smiling mask is attached, to reveal his outraged face showing a very different expression underneath.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Another actress snatches off his wig to reveal very sparse hair on the old man's head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The third actress takes Constanze's wig from Mozart and attempts to put it on his father's head.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: No, really!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{META_DATA}: (calling to him)
{DIALOGUE}: This is just a game, Papa.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Constanze echoes him with a touch of malice in her voice.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CONSTANZE
{DIALOGUE}: This is just a game, Papa!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Laughingly, the bystanders take it up, especially the children.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BYSTANDERS
{DIALOGUE}: This is just a game, Papa!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Leopold glares furiously about him, the actress succeeds in getting Constanze's wig firmly onto his head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everybody bursts into applause.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Delightedly, Constanze puts on Leopold's wig, hat and mask: from the waist up she now looks like a weird parody of Leopold in the smiling grey mask, and he looks like a weird parody of her in the silly feminine wig.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Schikaneder starts to play again, and the couples start to dance.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Leopold angrily takes off Constanze's wig and leaves the circle; his partner, Constanze, is left alone.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Seeing this, Mozart leaves his partner and catches his father entreatingly by the arm.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Oh no, Papa, please!
{DIALOGUE}: Don't spoil the fun.
{DIALOGUE}: Come on.
{DIALOGUE}: Here, take mine.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes off his own wig and puts it on Leopold's uncovered head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The effect, if not as ridiculous, is still somewhat bizarre, since Wolfgang favours fairly elaborate wigs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes Constanze's wig from his father.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As this happens, the music stops again.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart gently pushes his father down onto a nearby chair; the others scramble for the other chairs; and he is left as the Odd Man Out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He giggles.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Schikaneder calls out to Leopold from the keyboard.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCHIKANEDER
{DIALOGUE}: Herr Mozart, why don't you name your son's penalty?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Applause.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, Papa, name it.
{DIALOGUE}: Name it.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll do anything you say!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCHIKANEDER
{DIALOGUE}: What did he say?
{DIALOGUE}: What did he say?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEOPOLD
{DIALOGUE}: I'm tired of this game.
{DIALOGUE}: Please play without me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: But my penalty.
{DIALOGUE}: I've got to have a penalty.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All the bystanders are watching.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCHIKANEDER
{DIALOGUE}: I've got a good one.
{DIALOGUE}: I've got the perfect one for you.
{DIALOGUE}: Come over here.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart runs over to the forte-piano, and Schikaneder surrenders his place at it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCHIKANEDER
{DIALOGUE}: Now, I want you to play our tune - sitting backwards.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Applause.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, that's really too easy.
{DIALOGUE}: Any child can do that.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Amused sounds of disbelief.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCHIKANEDER
{DIALOGUE}: And a fugue in the manner of Sebastian Bach.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Renewed applause at this wicked extra penalty.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart smiles at Schikaneder - it is the sort of challenge he loves.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He defiantly puts on Constanze's wig and seats himself with his back to the keyboard.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Before the astonished eyes of the company he proceeds to execute this absurdly difficult task.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His right hand plays the bass part, his left hand the treble, and with this added difficulty he improvises a brilliant fugue on the subject of the tune to which they have been dancing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Attracted by this astonishing feat, the players draw nearer to the instrument.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: So does Salieri, cautiously, with some of the bystanders.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Constanze watches him approach.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Only Leopold sits by himself, sulking.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The fugue ends amidst terrific clapping.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The guests call out to Mozart.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GUESTS
{DIALOGUE}: Another!
{DIALOGUE}: Do another!
{DIALOGUE}: Someone else.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Give me a name.

{DIALOGUE}: Gluck!

{CHARACTER_NAME}: CONSTANZE
{DIALOGUE}: Salieri!
{DIALOGUE}: Do Salieri!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SMASH CUT: Salieri's masked face whips around and looks at her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Now that's hard.
{DIALOGUE}: That's very hard.
{DIALOGUE}: For Salieri one has to face the right way around.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Giggling, he turns around and sits at the keyboard.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, watched by a highly amused group, he begins a wicked parody.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He furrows his brow in mock concentration and closes his eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he begins to play the tune to which they danced, in the most obvious way imaginable, relying heavily on a totally and offensively unimaginative bass of tonic and dominant, endlessly repeated.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The music is the very essence of banality.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The bystanders rock with laughter.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart starts to giggle wildly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Through this excruciating scene, Salieri stares at Constanze, who suddenly turns her head and looks challengingly back at him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart's parody reaches its coarse climax with him adding a fart noise instead of notes to end cadences.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He builds this up, urged on in his clowning by everyone else, until suddenly he stops and cries out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The laughter cuts off.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart stands up, clutching his behind as if he has made a mess in his breeches.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The momentary hush of alarm is followed by a howl of laughter.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CU, Salieri staring in pain.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1823
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CU, The old man is shaking at the very recollection of his humiliation.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI

{DIALOGUE}: Laugh, laugh!
{META_DATA}: CUT BACK TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. GROTTO - NIGHT - 1780'S
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A repetition of the shot of Mozart at the forte-piano, wearing Constanze's wig and emitting a shrill giggle.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SALIERI'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1780'S
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Salieri sits at his desk.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He holds in his hand the small black party mask and stares in hatred at the place on the wall where the crucifix used to hang.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Faintly we see the mark of the cross.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: That was not Mozart laughing, Father.
{DIALOGUE}: That was God.
{DIALOGUE}: That was God!
{DIALOGUE}: God laughing at me through that obscene giggle.
{DIALOGUE}: Go on, Signore.
{DIALOGUE}: Laugh.
{DIALOGUE}: Rub my nose in it.
{DIALOGUE}: Show my mediocrity for all to see.
{DIALOGUE}: You wait!
{DIALOGUE}: I will laugh at You!
{DIALOGUE}: Before I leave this earth, I will laugh at You!
{DIALOGUE}: Amen!
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. MOZART'S WORKROOM - DAY - 1780'S
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is littered with manuscripts.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In the middle stands a billiard table.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The beautiful closing ensemble from Act IV of Figaro: Ah, Tutti contenti!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Saremo cosi plays in the background.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Standing at the billiard table, Mozart is dreamily hearing the music and playing shots on the table.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: From time to time he drifts over to a piece of manuscript paper and jots down notes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is very much in his own world of composition and the billiard balls are an aid to creation.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Presently, however, we hear a knocking at the door.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Standing at Mozart's desk, strewn with manuscripts, he picks up Mozart's pen and strokes the feather.

{DIALOGUE}: No!
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, 'bravo,' of course 'bravo'!

{CHARACTER_NAME}: VON STRACK
{DIALOGUE}: Oh yes, yes.
{DIALOGUE}: And that was?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ORSINI-ROSENBERG
{DIALOGUE}: Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet.
{DIALOGUE}: He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher.
{DIALOGUE}: Do you see the implications?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPH
{META_DATA}: (motioning him to be silent)
{DIALOGUE}: Mozart, I am a tolerant man.
{DIALOGUE}: I do not censor things lightly.

{DIALOGUE}: Figaro is a bad play.
{DIALOGUE}: It stirs up hatred between the classes.
{DIALOGUE}: In France it has caused nothing but bitterness.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: But, Majesty, this is just a frolic.
{DIALOGUE}: It's a piece about love.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPH
{DIALOGUE}: Ah, love again.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: But it's new, it's entirely new.
{DIALOGUE}: It's so new, people will go mad for it.
{DIALOGUE}: For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling.
{DIALOGUE}: Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation.
{DIALOGUE}: Duet turns into trio.
{DIALOGUE}: Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in.
{DIALOGUE}: Trio turns into quartet.
{DIALOGUE}: Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.
{DIALOGUE}: On and on, sextet, septet, octet!
{DIALOGUE}: How long do you think I can sustain that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOSEPH
{DIALOGUE}: I have no idea.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Guess!
{DIALOGUE}: Guess, Majesty.

{DIALOGUE}: Sire, only opera can do this.
{DIALOGUE}: In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise.
{DIALOGUE}: No one can understand a word.
{DIALOGUE}: But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony.
{DIALOGUE}: Isn't that marvelous?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VON SWIETEN
{DIALOGUE}: Mozart, music is not the issue here.
{DIALOGUE}: No one doubts your talent.
{DIALOGUE}: It is your judgment of literature that's in question.
{DIALOGUE}: Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce.
{DIALOGUE}: Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?
{DIALOGUE}: Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Elevated?
{DIALOGUE}: What does that mean?
{DIALOGUE}: Elevated!
{DIALOGUE}: The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm sorry.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm stupid.

{DIALOGUE}: That's what people want, you know: fantasy.
{DIALOGUE}: You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want.
{DIALOGUE}: Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Overture to The Magic Flute begins grandly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: To the music of the slow introduction, we see:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The room, lit by a few candles, appears dirty.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The camera shows us again Leopold's portrait on the wall, looking down upon a scene of disorder.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Papers litter the table; dirty dishes are piled in the fireplace; on the forte-piano lies Mozart's Masonic apron, woven with symbols.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: To the more lyrical passage of the introduction, we see Mozart take up a candle and enter:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We watch him stand beside Constanze, who lies asleep.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart now looks very ill; his wife appears worn out.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he moves to the cot where his son Karl lies asleep and kneels, pulls up the child's little blanket and for a moment lays his own head down beside the boy's.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Constanze opens her eyes and stares at him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart rises and returns to:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Introduction ends and suddenly the brilliant fast fugue begins.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Instantly Mozart starts to dance to it, all alone: gleefully, like a child.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks up at his father's portrait, and makes a silly, rude gesture at it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is, briefly, an irresponsible and happy boy again.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then suddenly there is a gentle knocking at the door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The music fades down.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Warily, Mozart crosses and opens he door.

{DIALOGUE}: Please, please!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She sits down tearfully, staring at him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We hear the Rex Tremendai Majestatis from the Requiem and see on the wall the portrait of Leopold Mozart looking down.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The camera pans slowly downward from it back to the table.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart is writing the music.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks up and sees that Constanze is fast asleep in her chair.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart gets up quietly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He puts on his hat and cloak, takes a bottle of wine and tiptoes from the house.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Without stopping, the music changes from the heavy Requiem to the light-hearted patter of the Papa-Papa duet from The Magic Flute.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SCHIKANEDER'S SUMMER HOUSE - NIGHT - 1790'S
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This little wooden structure stands in a courtyard in the tenement by the Weiden.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Inside, we see a table, chairs, a forte-piano, bottles and a chaos of papers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Strewn about in the chairs are the three actresses, giggling.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Schikaneder and Mozart, both drunk, are singing the duet of the two bird- people.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The actor sings Papageno and the composer, in a soprano voice, sings Papagena at the keyboard.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Absurdly, they end up rubbing noses and fall on each other's necks.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. VIENNA STREET - NIGHT - 1790'S
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart, drunk and happy, staggers back through the snow.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There are a few people about.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Stanzi?
{DIALOGUE}: Stanzi-marini-bini?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks about him, puzzled.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. FRAU WEBER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - 1790'S
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Frau Weber sits grimly talking.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mozart sits also, completely exhausted and passive under the rain of her constant speech.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FRAU WEBER
{DIALOGUE}: She's not coming back, you know.
{DIALOGUE}: She's gone for good.
{DIALOGUE}: I did it and I'm proud of it.

{DIALOGUE}: Can that be my Stanzi?
{DIALOGUE}: The happy little moppet I brought up, that poor trembling thing?
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, you monster!
{DIALOGUE}: No one exists but you, do they?
{DIALOGUE}: You and your music!
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know how often she's sat in that very chair, weeping her eyes out of her head because of you?
{DIALOGUE}: I warned her.
{DIALOGUE}: 'Choose a man, not a baby,' I said.
{DIALOGUE}: But would she listen?
{DIALOGUE}: Who listens?
{DIALOGUE}: 'He's just a silly boy,' she says.
{DIALOGUE}: Silly, my arse.
{DIALOGUE}: Selfish - that's all you are.
{DIALOGUE}: Selfish!
{DIALOGUE}: Selfish, selfish, selfish, selfish, selfish.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On stage we see the QUEEN OF THE NIGHT fantastically costumed, furiously urging her daughter to kill Sarastro.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As she sings, we see the interior of the theatre, now re-arranged from when we last visited it to watch the Cabaret.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An audience of ordinary German citizens stands in the pit area, or sits: they are rapt and excited.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The theatre also possesses boxes; some of these show closed curtains - their inhabitants presumably engaged in private intimacies.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In one of them sits Salieri.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: QUEEN OF THE NIGHT

{DIALOGUE}: Now what on earth could that be?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stares at the audience and winks at them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They laugh.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now Papageno's aria (Ein Madchen oder Weibchen) begins.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is interpolated, as he pretends to play his magic bells, with the glockenspiel actually being played off-stage by Mozart.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Schikaneder looks into the pit and does not see Mozart conducting.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks into the wings and realizes the situation with amusement.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At certain moments we see the stage from Salieri's point of view: Schikaneder singing, then pretending to play; and then we see Mozart playing the glockenspiel with great flourishes in the wings.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, suddenly, the actor mimes playing, and no sound comes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He mimes again, but still nothing comes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks offstage in anxiety; there is evidently some commotion.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: People are looking down on the floor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The song comes to a near-halt.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Schikaneder stares.

{META_DATA}: CUT TO:

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Salieri writes this, and continues now to write as swiftly and urgently as he can, at Mozart's dictation.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is obviously highly expert at doing this and hardly hesitates.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see his pen jotting down the notes as quickly as possible: the ink flicks onto the page.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He again hums the bass vocal line from the beginning, conducting.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On the soundtrack, we hear the second bassoon and bass trombone play it with him and the first bassoon and tenor trombone come in on top, playing the tenor vocal line.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The sound is bare and grim.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It stops at the end of the sixth measure.

{DIALOGUE}: And the next measures exactly the same, rising and rising - C to D to E, up to the dominant chord.
{DIALOGUE}: Do you see?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Salieri writes, Mozart sings the ostinato from the beginning, but the unaccompanied strings overwhelm his voice on the soundtrack, playing the first six bars of their agitated accompaniment.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They stop.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: That's wonderful!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MOZART
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, yes - go on.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he does so, he attempts to button his waistcoat, but does it ineptly, so that the vestment becomes bunched up, making him look absurd.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They load it onto a cart, drawn by a poor black horse.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Tears stream down his face.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Vogler watches him, amazed.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VOGLER
{DIALOGUE}: Why?
{DIALOGUE}: Why?
{DIALOGUE}: Why?
{DIALOGUE}: Why add to your misery by confessing to murder?
{DIALOGUE}: You didn't kill him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: I did.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VOGLER
{DIALOGUE}: No, you didn't!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: I poisoned his life.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VOGLER
{DIALOGUE}: But not his body.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: What difference does that make?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VOGLER
{DIALOGUE}: My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer?
{DIALOGUE}: Is that your penance?
{DIALOGUE}: Is it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: No, Father.
{DIALOGUE}: From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me.
{DIALOGUE}: Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing.
{DIALOGUE}: And that's my immortality - at last!
{DIALOGUE}: Our names will be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy.
{DIALOGUE}: At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VOGLER
{DIALOGUE}: Oh my son, my poor son!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Don't pity me.
{DIALOGUE}: Pity yourself.
{DIALOGUE}: You serve a wicked God.
{DIALOGUE}: He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity.
{DIALOGUE}: He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory.
{DIALOGUE}: He doesn't care.
{DIALOGUE}: Understand that.
{DIALOGUE}: God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses.
{DIALOGUE}: He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away.
{DIALOGUE}: Like an old, worn out flute.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Why did He do it?
{DIALOGUE}: Why didn't He kill me?
{DIALOGUE}: I had no value.
{DIALOGUE}: What was the use, keeping me alive for thirty-two years of torture?
{DIALOGUE}: Thirty-two years of honours and awards.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He tears off the Civilian Medal and Chain with which the Emperor invested him and has been wearing the whole time and throws it across the room.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Being bowed to and saluted, called 'distinguished - distinguished Salieri' - by men incapable of distinguishing!
{DIALOGUE}: Thirty-two years of meaningless fame to end up alone in my room, watching myself become extinct.
{DIALOGUE}: My music growing fainter, all the time fainter, until no one plays it at all.
{DIALOGUE}: And his growing louder, filling the world with wonder.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Goodbye, Father.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll speak for you.
{DIALOGUE}: I speak for all mediocrities in the world.
{DIALOGUE}: I am their champion.
{DIALOGUE}: I am their patron saint.
{DIALOGUE}: On their behalf I deny Him, your God of no mercy.
{DIALOGUE}: Your God who tortures men with longings they can never fulfill.
{DIALOGUE}: He may forgive me: I shall never forgive Him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He signs to the attendant, who wheels him in his chair out of the room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The priest stares after him.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. CORRIDOR OF THE HOSPITAL - MORNING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The corridor is filled with patients in white linen smocks, all taking their morning exercise walk in the care of nurses and nuns.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They form a long, wretched, strange procession - some of them are clearly very disturbed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Old Salieri is pushed through them in his wheelchair, he lifts his hands to them in benediction.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: OLD SALIERI
{DIALOGUE}: Mediocrities everywhere, now and to come: I absolve you all!
{DIALOGUE}: Amen!
