{DIALOGUE}: In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues.
{DIALOGUE}: The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico.
{DIALOGUE}: I know everybody that you're gonna meet.
{DIALOGUE}: It's important that they like you.
{DIALOGUE}: It's not important that they like me.
{DIALOGUE}: That's why I can help protect you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ROBERT
{DIALOGUE}: Like you protected Landry?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHERIDAN
{DIALOGUE}: I see where you're going with that, but if I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally I think it very self-defeating.
{DIALOGUE}: Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for.

{DIALOGUE}: Gates, Myrhvold, Bezos.
{DIALOGUE}: I sell to all those guys.
{DIALOGUE}: Why?
{DIALOGUE}: Because the technology to intrude has reached the masses.
{DIALOGUE}: Your competitor, your ex-spouse, adversaries, stalkers, they're at the local electronics store right now, and they're gonna be intruding on you not only through your telephone, but your fax, cell phone, pager, cable TV, Musak, windows, walls, air conditioning ventilation, modem, and internet connection.

{DIALOGUE}: And if you want a body count look no further than alcohol which racks up 80,000 kills a year.
{DIALOGUE}: Cocaine manages a measly 2,000.
{DIALOGUE}: Same for Heroin.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ANOTHER ANGLE ON ROBERT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: listening to ETHAN, earnest advocate of harm reduction.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ETHAN
{DIALOGUE}: What's the difference between Prozac and Ecstacy, you ask?
{DIALOGUE}: One's a mattress and the other's a trampoline.
{DIALOGUE}: Molecules don't have morality.
{DIALOGUE}: Really, think about it: some molecule changes the way a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor works, it's not suddenly a bad molecule; it's just a molecule.
{DIALOGUE}: My theory: America has a real fear of short, intense experiences.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Robert turns away --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ROBERT

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Robert moves away from the bar.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ANOTHER ROOM
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An argument is breaking out between an ECONOMIST and an UNDERSECRETARY OF DEFENSE with Robert as the audience.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ECONOMIST
{META_DATA}: (to the undersecretary)
{DIALOGUE}: You're not battling traffickers or dealers, but a market, and the market contains a paradox: if you arrest traffickers, you raise prices, and you also raise profits, which brings more traffickers into the business.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: UNDERSECRETARY
{META_DATA}: (to the Economist)
{DIALOGUE}: Back in the real world, we're talking about Mexico and not John Maynard Keynes.
{DIALOGUE}: We will spend 18 billion dollars this year on this "war," and the question on the table every year is do we certify Mexico as an ally or not?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Another man, RUSH PHILLIPS, a middle-aged powerbroker, overhears, then joins and Robert is encircled.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSH PHILLIPS
{DIALOGUE}: You want to make a difference, hit the users.
{DIALOGUE}: You don't jeopardize our financial markets by some hypocritical stance on drug consumption.
{DIALOGUE}: We're snorting it, why penalize Mexico for supplying it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: UNDERSECRETARY
{DIALOGUE}: Mexico, don't talk to me about Mexico --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ECONOMIST
{DIALOGUE}: It's the stick of law enforcement that creates the carrot of huge profits... That's economic truth --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSH PHILLIPS
{DIALOGUE}: Addicts don't vote; they don't have PACs; they don't spend soft money, that's political truth --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: UNDERSECRETARY
{DIALOGUE}: We're locking them up and consumption is falling --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ECONOMIST
{DIALOGUE}: The price of coke and heroin has dropped and purity has increased.
{DIALOGUE}: All this law enforcement has achieved is kids can get better stuff, cheaper.
{DIALOGUE}: In economic terms, you can forget it; this is not a winnable war.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSH PHILLIPS
{DIALOGUE}: Christ, you want to decertify somebody, take Pakistan or Columbia.
{DIALOGUE}: We don't need them for anything.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ECONOMIST
{DIALOGUE}: If you manage to seize an inconceivable 50 percent of all drugs coming into this country, you'll still raise the price of coke and heroin less than 3 percent which won't affect drug use at all.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RUSH PHILLIPS
{DIALOGUE}: Why are we calling this a war at all?
{DIALOGUE}: You don't declare war on your own people.
{DIALOGUE}: Addiction is a little worm that gnaws a house apart from the inside.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MICHAEL ADLER, about Robert's age, and as successful, but in a different way, approaches, catching Robert's eye through the arguing demagogues.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: UNDERSECRETARY
{DIALOGUE}: We need Mexico for these reasons: number one -- Defense; two -- Trade; three -- Tourism; then, way on down the line, comes Drugs.
{DIALOGUE}: The President knows this.
{DIALOGUE}: Why's he holding everybody's feet to the fire?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MICHAEL
{META_DATA}: (solemn)
{DIALOGUE}: Mr. Wakefield, there's a situation that needs your attention right away.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MICHAEL
{DIALOGUE}: The worst serial killer in history - who?
{DIALOGUE}: Gacy - right?
{DIALOGUE}: Killed forty two people.
{DIALOGUE}: Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ROBERT
{DIALOGUE}: Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MICHAEL
{DIALOGUE}: We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama.
{DIALOGUE}: Is that covered in your Constitution?
{DIALOGUE}: Because it isn't in mine.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ROBERT
{DIALOGUE}: Noriega is a criminal.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MICHAEL
{DIALOGUE}: Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S. Government.
{DIALOGUE}: So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ROBERT
{META_DATA}: (amused)
{DIALOGUE}: Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MICHAEL
{DIALOGUE}: I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ROBERT
{DIALOGUE}: If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.

{DIALOGUE}: We can protect you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ruiz looks at them in disbelief.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CASTRO
{DIALOGUE}: Who do you work for?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RUIZ
