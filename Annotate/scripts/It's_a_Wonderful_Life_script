{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAN
{DIALOGUE}: Wait just a minute now.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: POTTER

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dr. Campbell rises from his seat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: George and Uncle Billy start to collect their papers and leave the table.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. CAMPBELL
{DIALOGUE}: But before you go, I'm sure the whole board wishes to express its deep sorrow at the passing of Peter Bailey.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORGE
{DIALOGUE}: Thank you very much.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. CAMPBELL
{DIALOGUE}: It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: POTTER
{DIALOGUE}: I'll go further than that.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll say that to the public Peter Bailey was the Building and Loan.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everyone looks at him surprised.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: UNCLE BILLY
{META_DATA}: (trying to control himself)
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, that's fine, Potter, coming from you, considering that you probably drove him to his grave.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: POTTER
{DIALOGUE}: Peter Bailey was not a business man.
{DIALOGUE}: That's what killed him.
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, I don't mean any disrespect to him, God rest his soul.
{DIALOGUE}: He was a man of high ideals, so-called, but ideals without common sense can ruin this town.
{META_DATA}: (picking up papers from table)
{DIALOGUE}: Now, you take this loan here to Ernie Bishop... You know, that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi.
{DIALOGUE}: You know... I happen to know the bank turned down this loan, but he comes here and we're building him a house worth five thousand dollars.
{DIALOGUE}: Why?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: George is at the door of the office, holding his coat and papers, ready to leave.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORGE
{DIALOGUE}: Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter.
{DIALOGUE}: You have all the papers there.

{DIALOGUE}: I can personally vouch for his character.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: POTTER
{META_DATA}: (sarcastically)
{DIALOGUE}: A friend of yours?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORGE
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, sir.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: POTTER
{DIALOGUE}: You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money.
{DIALOGUE}: What does that get us?
{DIALOGUE}: A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class.
{DIALOGUE}: And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas.
{DIALOGUE}: Now, I say...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: George puts down his coat and comes around to the table, incensed by what Potter is saying about his father.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORGE
{DIALOGUE}: Just a minute – just a minute.
{DIALOGUE}: Now, hold on, Mr. Potter.
{DIALOGUE}: You're right when you say my father was no business man.
{DIALOGUE}: I know that.
{DIALOGUE}: Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know.
{DIALOGUE}: But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was... Why, in the twenty- five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself.
{DIALOGUE}: Isn't that right, Uncle Billy?
{DIALOGUE}: He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me.
{DIALOGUE}: But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter.
{DIALOGUE}: And what's wrong with that?
{DIALOGUE}: Why... Here, you're all businessmen here.
{DIALOGUE}: Doesn't it make them better citizens?
{DIALOGUE}: Doesn't it make them better customers?
{DIALOGUE}: You... you said... What'd you say just a minute ago?
{DIALOGUE}: ... They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home.
{DIALOGUE}: Wait!
{DIALOGUE}: Wait for what?
{DIALOGUE}: Until their children grow up and leave them?
{DIALOGUE}: Until they're so old and broken- down that they... Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars?
{DIALOGUE}: Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about... they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community.
{DIALOGUE}: Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath?
{DIALOGUE}: Anyway, my father didn't think so.
{DIALOGUE}: People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle.
{DIALOGUE}: Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: POTTER
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not interested in your book.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORGE
{DIALOGUE}: I know very well what you're talking about.
{DIALOGUE}: You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you.
{DIALOGUE}: That's what you're talking about, I know.
{META_DATA}: (to the Board)
{DIALOGUE}: Well, I've said too much.
{DIALOGUE}: I..
{DIALOGUE}: You're the Board here.
{DIALOGUE}: You do what you want with this thing.
{DIALOGUE}: Just one thing more, though.
{DIALOGUE}: This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter.
{DIALOGUE}: Come on, Uncle Billy!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: George leaves the room, followed by the jubilant Uncle Billy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Potter's face is grim with hatred.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The "frustrated old man" remark was gall in his veins.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: POTTER

{DIALOGUE}: George, now that's just what I like so much about you.
{META_DATA}: (pleasantly and smoothly)
{DIALOGUE}: George, I'm an old man, and most people hate me.
{DIALOGUE}: But I don't like them either, so that makes it all even.
{DIALOGUE}: You know just as well as I do that I run practically everything in this town but the Bailey Building and Loan.
{DIALOGUE}: You know, also, that for a number of years I've been trying to get control of it... or kill it.
{DIALOGUE}: But I haven't been able to do it.
{DIALOGUE}: You have been stopping me.
{DIALOGUE}: In fact, you have beaten me, George, and as anyone in this county can tell you, that takes some doing.
{DIALOGUE}: Take during the depression, for instance.
{DIALOGUE}: You and I were the only ones that kept our heads.
{DIALOGUE}: You saved the Building and Loan, and I saved all the rest.

{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{DIALOGUE}: Well, most people say you stole all the rest.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: POTTER
{DIALOGUE}: Forty-five.
{DIALOGUE}: Forty-five.
{DIALOGUE}: Out of which, after supporting your mother, and paying your bills, you're able to keep, say, ten, if you skimp.
{DIALOGUE}: A child or two comes along, and you won't even be able to save the ten.
{DIALOGUE}: Now, if this young man of twenty-eight was a common, ordinary yokel, I'd say he was doing fine.
{DIALOGUE}: But George Bailey is not a common, ordinary yokel.
{DIALOGUE}: He's an intelligent, smart, ambitious young man — who hates his job – who hates the Building and Loan almost as much as I do.
{DIALOGUE}: A young man who's been dying to get out on his own ever since he was born.
{DIALOGUE}: A young man... the smartest one of the crowd, mind you, a young man who has to sit by and watch his friends go places, because he's trapped.
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic-eaters.
{DIALOGUE}: Do I paint a correct picture, or do I exaggerate?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORGE
{META_DATA}: (mystified)

{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORGE
{META_DATA}: (flabbergasted)
{DIALOGUE}: Twenty thou... twenty thousand dollars a year?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: POTTER
{DIALOGUE}: You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe.
{DIALOGUE}: You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORGE
{DIALOGUE}: Would I?

{META_DATA}: (offers hand)
{DIALOGUE}: Okay, George?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORGE
{META_DATA}: (taking his hand)
{DIALOGUE}: Okay, Mr. Potter.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As they shake hands, George feels a physical revulsion.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Potter's hand feels like a cold mackerel to him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In that moment of physical contact he knows he could never be associated with this man.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: George drops his hand with a shudder.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He peers intently into Potter's face.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORGE

{DIALOGUE}: You once called me a warped, frustrated old man.
{DIALOGUE}: What are you but a warped, frustrated young man?
{DIALOGUE}: A miserable little clerk crawling in here on your hands and knees and begging for help.
{DIALOGUE}: No securities – no stocks – no bonds – nothing but a miserable little five hundred dollar equity in a life insurance policy.
{DIALOGUE}: You're worth more dead than alive.
{DIALOGUE}: Why don't you go to the riff-raff you love so much and ask them to let you have eight thousand dollar?
{DIALOGUE}: You know why?
{DIALOGUE}: Because they'd run you out of town on a rail... But I'll tell you what I'm going to do for you, George.
