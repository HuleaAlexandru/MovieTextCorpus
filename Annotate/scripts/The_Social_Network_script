{META_DATA}: FROM THE BLACK WE HEAR--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Did you know there are more people with genius IQ's living in China than there are people of any kind living in the United States?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA (V.O. )
{DIALOGUE}: That can't be true.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: it is true.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: What would account for that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK (V.0.)
{DIALOGUE}: Well first of all, a lot of people live in China.
{DIALOGUE}: But here's my question:
{META_DATA}: FADE IN
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. CAMPUS BAR - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MARK ZUCKERBERG is a sweet looking 19 year old whose lack of any physically intimidating attributes masks a very complicated and dangerous anger.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He has trouble making eye contact- and sometimes it's hard to tell if he's talking to you or to himself.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ERICA, also 19, is Mark's date.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She has a girl-next-door face that makes her easy to fall for.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At this point in the conversation she already knows that she'd rather not be there and her politeness is about to be tested.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The scene is stark and simple.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: How do you distinguish yourself in a population of people who all got 1600 on their SAT's?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't know they take SAT's in China.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: I wasn't talking about China anymore, I was talking about here.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: You got 1600?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: You can sing in an a Capella group.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 2.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRICA
{DIALOGUE}: Does that mean that you actually got nothing wrong?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: Or you row crew or you invent a 25 dollar PC.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: Or you get into a final club.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: Or you get into a final club, exactly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: I like guys who row crew.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{META_DATA}: (BEAT)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Well I can't do that.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And yes, it means I got nothing wrong on the test.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: Have you ever tried?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: I'm trying now.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: To row crew?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: To get into a final club.
{DIALOGUE}: To row crew?
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: Are you, like--whatever--crazy?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: Sometimes, Mark-seriously-YOU say two things at once and I'm not sure which one we're talking about.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: But you've seen guys who row crew, right?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: Okay, well.
{DIALOGUE}: they're bigger than me.
{DIALOGUE}: They're world class athletes.
{DIALOGUE}: And a second ago you said you like guys who row crew so I assumed you'd met one.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: I guess I meant I liked the idea of it.
{DIALOGUE}: The way a girl likes cowboys.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 3.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: The Phoenix is good.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: This is a new topic?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: It's the same topic.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: We're still talking about the finals clubs?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: Would you rather talk about something else?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: It's just that since the beginning of the conversation about finals clubs I think I may have had a birthday.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: We can change the subject.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ERICA.
{META_DATA}: (can't get over it)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There are more people in China with genius IQ's than the entire population of--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: It's about exclusivity.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: T'RICA
{DIALOGUE}: .....what is?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: The final clubs.
{DIALOGUE}: And that's how you distinguish yourself.
{DIALOGUE}: The Phoenix is the most diverse.
{DIALOGUE}: The Fly Club, Roosevelt punched the Porc.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: Which one?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: The Porcellian, the Porc, it's the best of the best.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: I actually meant which Roosevelt.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: Theodore.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 4.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: Okay, well, which is the easiest one to get into?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MARK takes a cigarette from a pack, lights it, takes a drag and blows the smoke out before he says...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: Hm.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: What?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: why would you ask me that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: I was just asking.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: They're all hard to get into.
{DIALOGUE}: My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting on oil futures last summer and he won't get in.
{DIALOGUE}: Money or the ability to make it doesn't impress anybody around here.
{DIALOGUE}: Everybody can do that.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: He made $300,000 in a summer?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: He likes meteorology.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: You said it was oil futures.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: If you can predict the weather you can predict the price of heating oil.
{DIALOGUE}: You asked me that because you think the final club that's easiest to get into is the one where I'll have the best chance,
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{META_DATA}: (BEAT)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: I've lost my place again.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: You asked me which one was the easiest to get into because you think that's where I have the best chance.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: The one that's easiest to get into would be the one where anybody had the best chance.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: S.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: I just think you asked--the placement of where you asked the question--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: I was honestly just asking.
{DIALOGUE}: Okay?
{DIALOGUE}: I was asking just to ask.
{DIALOGUE}: Mark, I'm not speaking in code.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: Erica--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: You're obsessed with the finals clubs.
{DIALOGUE}: You have finals clubs OCD and you need to see someone about this who'll prescribe some sort of medication.
{DIALOGUE}: You don't care if side effects may include blindness, okay, just do it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: Final clubs.
{DIALOGUE}: Not finals clubs and there's a difference between being obsessed and being motivated.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: Yes there is.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: Well you do--that was cryptic--so you do speak in code.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't mean to be cryptic.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: I'm saving I need to do something substantial in order to get the attention of the clubs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: Why?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: Because they're exclusive.
{META_DATA}: (BEAT)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And fun and they lead to a better life.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: You think Teddy Roosevelt got elected president because he was a member of the Phoenix Club?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: He was a member of the Porcellian and yes I do.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 6.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe he sang in an a Capella group.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: I want to be straight forward and tell you that I think you should be a lot more supportive.
{DIALOGUE}: If I get in I'll be taking you to the parties and you'll be meeting people that you wouldn't normally get to meet.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{META_DATA}: (SMILES)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: You would do that for me?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: You're my girlfriend.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: okay, well I want to be straight forward and tell you that I'm not anymore.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{META_DATA}: (BEAT)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: What do you mean?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not your girlfriend anymore,
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: Is this a joke?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: No, I'm sorry, it's not.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: You're breaking up with me?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: You're going to introduce me to people I wouldn't normally get to meet?
{DIALOGUE}: What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: Take it easy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: What was it supposed to mean?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: It was--Erica, the reason we're able to sit here and drink is that you used to sleep with the door guy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{META_DATA}: (PAUSE)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: I want to really try not to lose it now.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: The door guy's name is Bobby.
{DIALOGUE}: I haven't slept with the door guy, the door guy's a friend of mine.
{DIALOGUE}: He's a perfectly good class of people and what part of Long Island are you from--England?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK

{DIALOGUE}: Come on.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: ---I have to study.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: You don't have to study.
{DIALOGUE}: Let's just talk.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: I can't.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: Why?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: Because it's exhausting.
{DIALOGUE}: Going out with you is like dating a stairmaster.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: S.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: All I meant is that you go to B.U. and so you're not likely to--I wasn't making a comment on your parents--I was saying you go to B.U.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: I have to go study.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: You don't have to study.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: How do you know I don't have to study?!

{DIALOGUE}: Do you want to get some food?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: I'm sorry you're not sufficiently impressed with my education.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: And I'm sorry T don't have a rowboat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{DIALOGUE}: I think we should just be friends.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: I don't need friends.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA OF
{DIALOGUE}: I was being polite, I had no intention being friends with you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARK
{DIALOGUE}: You're really leaving.
{DIALOGUE}: ERICA takes MARK's hand and looks at him tenderly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ERICA
{META_DATA}: (CLOSE)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Listen, You're going to be successful and rich.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But you're going to go through life thinking that girls don't like you because you're a tech geek.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that that won't be true.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It'll be because you're an asshole.

{DIALOGUE}: The Kirkland Facebook is open on my desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendous f acebook-pics.
{DIALOGUE}: Billy Olson's sitting here and had the idea of putting some of these girls' faces next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on who's hotter.

{DIALOGUE}: year it's on.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not gonna do the farm animals but I like the idea of comparing two people together.
{DIALOGUE}: It gives the whole thing a very Turing feel since people's ratings of the pictures will be more implicit than, say, choosing a number to represent each person's hotness like they do on hotornot.com.
{DIALOGUE}: The first thing we're going to need is a lot of pictures.
{DIALOGUE}: Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep a public centralized facebook so I'm going to have to get all the images from the individual houses that people are in.
