{CHARACTER_NAME}: HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)

{DIALOGUE}: But it's not the worst.

{DIALOGUE}: Nice of you to join the party.
{DIALOGUE}: I thought you'd been carried off.
{DIALOGUE}: Hiccup dons a leather apron and starts to put away Gobber's scattered appendages.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HICCUP
{DIALOGUE}: Who me?
{DIALOGUE}: Nah, come on!

{DIALOGUE}: They wouldn't know what to do with all this.
{DIALOGUE}: Hiccup strikes a bodybuilder pose.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GOBBER
{DIALOGUE}: They need toothpicks, don't they?
{DIALOGUE}: Hiccup gets to work, transferring bent and chipped weapons to the forge as Vikings crowd the counter for replacements.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HICCUP (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: The meathead with attitude and interchangeable hands is Gobber.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: STOICK
{DIALOGUE}: We move to the lower defenses.
{DIALOGUE}: We'll counter-attack with the catapults.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 5.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Stoick follows up the rear as, overhead, a dragon strafes the rooftops with Napalm-like fire.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HICCUP (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: See?
{DIALOGUE}: Old village.
{DIALOGUE}: Lots and lots of new houses.
{META_DATA}: VIKING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: FIRE!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In response, the fire brigade charges through the plaza -- four TEENS, tugging a large wooden cask on wheels.

{DIALOGUE}: Oh, you've made plenty of marks.
{DIALOGUE}: All in the wrong places.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HICCUP
{DIALOGUE}: Please, two minutes.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll kill a dragon.
{DIALOGUE}: My life will get infinitely better.
{DIALOGUE}: I might even get a date.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GOBBER
{DIALOGUE}: You can't lift a hammer.
{DIALOGUE}: You can't swing an axe... Gobber grabs a bola (iron balls connected by rope).
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 6.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GOBBER (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: ... you can't even throw one of these.
{DIALOGUE}: A Viking runs by and nabs it out of Gobber's hand, hurling it at a dive-bombing Gronkle.
{DIALOGUE}: The bola binds its legs, sending it into a heavy crash.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HICCUP
{META_DATA}: (ready with the answer)
{DIALOGUE}: Okay fine, but... He rushes to the back corner of the stall and presents a bizarre, wheel barrow-like contraption.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HICCUP (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: ... this will throw it for me.
{DIALOGUE}: Hiccup OPENS the hinged lid of the device.
{DIALOGUE}: An arm springs up, equipped with twin bows.

{DIALOGUE}: The Nadders clamber onto the building, tearing the roof and walls apart.
{DIALOGUE}: Sheep pour out and SCATTER.
{DIALOGUE}: Elsewhere, hippo-like Gronckles pick drying racks clean of fish and fly off like loaded pelicans.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)

{DIALOGUE}: Taking down one of those would definitely get me a girlfriend.
{DIALOGUE}: A stealthy, snake-like dragon head peeks over a rooftop, breathing gas into a chimney.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: HICCUP (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: And then there's the Monstrous Nightmare.
{DIALOGUE}: Only the best Vikings go after those.
{DIALOGUE}: They have this nasty habit of setting themselves on fire.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: HICCUP (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: Except for you.
{DIALOGUE}: ON STOICK, holding down the netted Nadders.
{DIALOGUE}: He hears a familiar HOLLER and looks up to see... HICCUP running through the PLAZA, SCREAMING, with the NIGHTMARE fast on his heels.
{DIALOGUE}: Alarmed, Stoick abandons the Nadders and runs off.

{DIALOGUE}: With the dragon watching his every move, Hiccup hurriedly saws through the bola ropes.
{DIALOGUE}: As the last rope falls free, the Night Fury suddenly POUNCES!
{DIALOGUE}: In a blur, the dragon is upon him, pinning Hiccup down, grazing his neck.
{DIALOGUE}: Looking like it's about to kill him.
{DIALOGUE}: Hiccup is paralyzed.
{DIALOGUE}: The dragon's breath ruffles his hair.
{DIALOGUE}: Hiccup opens his eyes to find the Night Fury's wolf-like stare boring into him.
{DIALOGUE}: The exchange is intense, profound.
{DIALOGUE}: The dragon draws a deep breath, as though it's about to torch him, then lets out an ear-piercing scream instead.
{DIALOGUE}: It turns and takes flight, flapping violently through the canopy of trees.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: HICCUP (CONT'D)

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As they slow to a stop, Hiccup goes weightless.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The rings of his vest float off of the harness hooks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hiccup suddenly finds himself detached, free-falling.

{DIALOGUE}: You just gotta kinda angle yourself.
{DIALOGUE}: No, no...come back down towards me.
{DIALOGUE}: Come back down-- Hiccup extends his arms and legs, giving himself as much surface area as he can.
{DIALOGUE}: He angles back towards Toothless as the tumbling dragon WHACKS Hiccup with his wing.
{DIALOGUE}: After a few more misses, Hiccup finally GRABS HOLD of the harness and manages to lock in -- just in time to pull Toothless out of his dive... barely shy of the tree tops.
{DIALOGUE}: They careen past the wooded cliff and directly into a treacherous slalom course of jutting sea stacks.
{DIALOGUE}: Hiccup pulls the cheat sheet from his teeth and attempts to check positions.
{DIALOGUE}: It flaps violently in the turbulence, making it impossible.
{DIALOGUE}: With no time to think, Hiccup throws it away and steers Toothless' tail on instinct... with perfect intuition.
{DIALOGUE}: Together, they manage a tight, hair-rasing series of split- second turns, making it to the open water, unscathed.
{DIALOGUE}: Hiccup takes a breath and glances back at the death-defying obstacle course, now safely behind them.
{DIALOGUE}: He beams, relieved.
{DIALOGUE}: He sits back and throws his arms up in victory.

{DIALOGUE}: Another attempts to steal it from him.
{DIALOGUE}: They face off and last fire balls at each other to settle the fight.
{DIALOGUE}: Hiccup and Toothless watch, amused.
{DIALOGUE}: That is until... Toothless spots one of his fish leaving the pile.
{DIALOGUE}: A stealthy Terrible Terror is exposed as the thief.
{DIALOGUE}: They tug on the fish, and it snaps back into Toothless' mouth.
{DIALOGUE}: He swallows it back tauntingly.
{DIALOGUE}: Irate, the little dragon paws at the ground and blast Toothless.
{DIALOGUE}: He opens his mouth, the gas hiss comes, and Toothless fires a tiny flame straight into its mouth, causing the gas to backfire into the little dragon.
{DIALOGUE}: It coughs up smoke and staggers away, looking ill.
{DIALOGUE}: Hiccup laughs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HICCUP (CONT'D)
