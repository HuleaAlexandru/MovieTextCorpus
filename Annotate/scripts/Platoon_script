{META_DATA}: FADE IN:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A QUOTATION AGAINST A BLACK SCREEN:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 'REJOICE, O YOUNG MAN, IN THY YOUTH ...'
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The sound now of a C-130 air cargo plane roaring over us and we cut sharply to:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT.AIRSTRIP - BASE CAMP - VIETNAM - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the C-130 coasts to a stop, the hatch rotating down on a hot, dusty lifeless airstrip somewhere in Vietnam.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Nothing seems to live or move in the midday sun.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: TITLES RUN
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A DOZEN NEW RECRUITS step off the plane, unloading their duffel bags, looking around like only the new can look around, their hair regulation-clipped, crisp, new green fatigues fitting them like cardboard.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CHRIS TAYLOR is just another one of them - as he turns into a tight closeup, to look at a motorized cart pulling up alongside ... He's about 21.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Newmeat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His face, unburned yet by the sun, is tense, bewildered, innocent, eyes searching for the truth.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They fall now on a heap of BODY BAGS in the back of the cart.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Two soldiers begin loading them onto the plane.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Flies - hundreds of flies - buzz around them, the only cue to their contents.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GARDNER
{META_DATA}: (next to Chris, Southern accent)
{DIALOGUE}: That what I think it is?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLDIER 1
{META_DATA}: (a look)
{DIALOGUE}: I guess so ...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An uncomfortable look between them.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SERGENT
{DIALOGUE}: Okay, let's go ...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As they move out, Chris' eyes moving with the body bags being loaded onto the plane.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Moving over now to a motley HALF DOZEN VETERANS bypassing them on their way to the plane.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They look happy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Very happy, chatting it up.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They pass the newboys - and they shake their heads, their eyes full of an almost mocking pity.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VETERANS
{DIALOGUE}: Well I'll be dipped in shit - new meat!
{DIALOGUE}: Sorry bout that boys - 'sin loi' buddy ... you gonna love the Nam, man, for-fucking-ever.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chris looking at them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They pass, except for the last man who walks slower than the rest, a slight limp.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His eyes fall on Chris.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They're frightening eyes, starved, hollow, sunken deep in his face, black and dangerous.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The clammy pallor of malaria clings to him as he looks at Chris through decayed black teeth.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then the sun flares out on him and he's past.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And Chris looks back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Disturbed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's as if the man was not real.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For a moment there.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As if he were a ghost.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chris walking, duffel bag on the shoulder, looks up at the lollipop sun burning a hole through the sky.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A rushing SOUND now.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Of frightening intensity, an effect combining the blast of an airplane with the roar of a lion as we hardcut to:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. JUNGLE - SOMEWHERE IN VIETNAM - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The sun matches the intensity of the previous shot as we move down into thick green jungle.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We hear the sound of MEN coming, a lot of men.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The thwack of a machete.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brush being bulled.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We wait.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are getting close.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The CREDITS continue to run.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SUBTITLE reads: December 1967 - Bravo Company, 25th Infantry Division - Somewhere near the Cambodian Border.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A sweating white face comes into view.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CHRIS - cutting point.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Machete in one hand, whacking out a path for the platoon, M-16 in the other, he looks like he's on the verge of heat exhaustion.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Breathing too hard, pacing himself all wrong, bumping into things, tripping, not quite falling, he looks pathetic here in the naturalness of the jungle.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An urban transplant, slightly neurotic and getting more so.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His rucksack is coming apart as well, about 70 badly packed pounds banging noisily.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Behind him BARNES now comes, the Platoon Sergeant.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then the RTO, his radio man, humming lightly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Others are behind, the column snaking back deep into the brush.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We cut around some FACES of the Platoon - all to be seen later.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Young faces, hard and dirty after weeks in the field, exhausted yet alert, fatigues filthy, slept-in, torn, personalized, hair way past regulation length, medals, bandanas.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A jungle army.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Boys.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chris glancing down at his raw bleeding blisters.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Transfers the machete to his other, slightly less blistered, hand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The kid cuts on - struggling but trying, on his last reserves of strength, smashing almost straight forward through brush, not even bothering to look ahead.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He smells something, looks around, slows his pace, eyes working ... around to the base of a tree.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He moves past it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And as he does so, the camera from his POV comes around on a dead decomposing 10-day-old GOOK - eyes starting from its sockets, worms and flies feasting.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chris draws his breath in, terrified.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Barnes suddenly appears alongside, his hard humourless eyes looking annoyed from the gook to Chris.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BARNES
{DIALOGUE}: What are you waiting for?
{DIALOGUE}: He ain't gonna bite you.
{DIALOGUE}: Move out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chris looks at him with pent-up hatred and crashes on.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chris standing there one moment, fighting for his breath, suddenly passes out, going over with his 70 pound rucksack, hitting the ground with a loud bang.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ELIAS
{META_DATA}: (concerned)
{DIALOGUE}: Hold it up.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On Chris - his eyes opening.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He seems all right.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRIS
{META_DATA}: (trying to get up)

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chris crumples backwards.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Elias helps him.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. COMPANY PERIMETER #1 - DUSK
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The COMPANY - about 100 men who seem insignificant amid the size of the surrounding jungle - is digging into a perimeter of some 100-yard radius.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A RESUPPLY CHOPPER lifts off in a flurry of blowing leaves.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bare-chested soldiers chop down trees, clear fields of fire, set out claymores, fill sandbags, chow down.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Of Indian blood, with long black hair, generous smile, wide facial bone structure, gypsy eyes, and the cleanest white teeth, he could be a young Greek god.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is given somewhat to panache, a silver wristband on his arm, a bandana of black parachute silk hanging from his neck, his fatigues tightened down at the ankle, he pulls his pants down, checking for crotch rot, applying talcum powder to the area, his buttocks facing us.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They're both black, Junior with huge goggle eyes and a face of pimples and pockmarks, his teeth yellowed and decayed, some of them missing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Harold is about twice his size, about 250 pounds, a baby huey concentrating real hard on preparing his stove to eat with.

{DIALOGUE}: Some goddamn week, grandma ...
{META_DATA}: (checking his raw blisters)
{DIALOGUE}: ... the hardest thing I think I've ever done is to go on point, 3 times this week - I don't even know what I'm doing.
{DIALOGUE}: A gook could be standing 3 feet in front of me and I wouldn't know it, I'm so tired.
{DIALOGUE}: We get up at 5 a.m., hump all day, camp around 4 or 5 p.m., dig foxhole, eat, then put out an all-night ambush or a 3-man listening post in the jungle.
{DIALOGUE}: It's scary cause nobody tells me how to do anything cause I'm new and nobody cares about the new guys, they don't even want to know your name.
{DIALOGUE}: The unwritten rule is a new guy's life isn't worth as much cause he hasn't put his time in yet - and they say if you're gonna get killed in the Nam it's better to get it in the first few weeks, the logic being: you don't suffer that much.
{DIALOGUE}: I can believe that ... If you're lucky you get to stay in the perimeter at night and then you pull a 3-hour guard shift, so maybe you sleep 3-4 hours a night, but you don't really sleep ... I don't think I can keep this up for a year, grandma - I think I've made a big mistake coming here ...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he speaks, we cut around to various shots of the platoon members on the perimeter - shaving, eating, cooking, playing, etc ...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. PLATOON PC - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Towards the end of this voice over, we cut to Sgt. BARNES moving towards the PLATOON PC.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: WOLFE (CONT'D)
{META_DATA}: (to Barnes)
{DIALOGUE}: Who do you want on ambush, Sergeant?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Barnes doesn't bother acknowledging the question, barely glancing at the Lieutenant, to him a necessary evil.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: O'NEILL
{DIALOGUE}: Shit!
{DIALOGUE}: Morehouse and Sal are short.
{DIALOGUE}: Fu Sheng's going on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: O'NEILL
{DIALOGUE}: Fuck you Elias.

{DIALOGUE}: You get your men ready Elias ...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Concluding the debate, no further argument, Barnes rises.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The meeting's closed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lt. Wolfe hasn't said a word, looking as Elias departs, without a word.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: O'NEILL
{META_DATA}: (watching him)
{DIALOGUE}: Fucking guy's got 3 years in and he thinks he's Cochise or something ...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His resentment directed partly at the way in which Elias carries himself, the natural sense of grace - and the dignity it bestows.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. PLATOON PERIMETER #1 - SQUAD ASSEMBLY POINT - DUSK
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Later.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On the very edge of the perimeter, darkness coming down fast, the men in the ambush patrol rustle into their packs, all of them bitching.

{DIALOGUE}: I know this is going to be the war of my generation.
{DIALOGUE}: Well here I am - anonymous all right, with guys nobody really cares about - they come from the end of the line, most of 'em, small towns you never heard of - Pulaski, Tennessee, Brandon, Mississippi, Pork Bend, Utah, Wampum, Pennsylvania.
{DIALOGUE}: Two years' high school's about it, maybe if they're lucky a job waiting for 'em back in a factory, but most of 'em got nothing, they're poor, they're the unwanted of our society, yet they're fighting for our society and our freedom and what we call America, they're the bottom of the barrel - and they know it, maybe that's why they call themselves 'grunts' cause a 'grunt' can take it, can take anything.
{DIALOGUE}: They're the backbone of this country, grandma, the best I've ever seen, the heart and soul - I've found it finally, way down here in the mud - maybe from down here I can start up again and be something I can be proud of, without having to fake it, maybe ... I can see something I don't yet see, learn something I don't yet know ... I miss you, I miss you very much, tell Mom I miss her too - Chris.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A long beat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He sighs, the sigh kicking off the next image.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. CHRIS' POSITION - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chris jerks awake - very suddenly, very frightened.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE RAIN HAS STOPPED.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The jungle sounds are loud.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cicadas, night animals, water dripping hypnotically from leaf to leaf.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And the whirr of a million mosquitoes out after the rains, chewing at Chris' face.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks around, startled.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Tex is asleep.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Junior is asleep.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: What happened?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks at his watch.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Tex seems like a mile away.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Why doesn't anyone fire!

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A rattle of his equipment, a creak of leather.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A smell.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The man's face now catches the moonlight and his eyes come around on Chris.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Oriental eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Looking right at him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Startled.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The uniform is shredded, the figure obviously hurt in several places (thigh, back, neck, hand) but not mortally so, now struggling to right itself, dragging its face up from a belly- down position.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Streaked with dirt and blood, we see Barnes once again re-emerging from the dead.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chris steps over to him, a solemn look on his face.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Barnes looks up, begs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BARNES
{DIALOGUE}: Get me a Medic will ya.
{DIALOGUE}: Go on ...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chris doesn't move.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Barnes looks at him again, reading the intention that has crossed Chris' mind.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An expression of surprise crosses his face, then amazement, almost shock.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BARNES (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: Fuck you in hell ...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chris shoots him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Once.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Twice.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Three times.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Silence ...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Barnes is finally dead.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chris looking at the corpse, numbed, no exultation in his expression.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just cold satisfaction and little feeling left.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Behind him, the SOUND of a big machine moving.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A huge Nazi flag on an antenna looms up in the bush, followed by the great belly of a turreted dragon crunching down a tree for its breakfast.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A big tough GERMAN SHEPARD comes boudning at him sniffs, followed by a flak-jacketed MONSTER MAN - filthy and greasy, unshaven face, earring in his left ear, 'DEATH CORPS' scrawled on his shirtless flak jacket and a drawing of a death's head, he looks like a cross between a pirate and a hell's angel.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Behind him, a SECOND MONSTER MAN and the ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER grinding its engine, a human skull hanging from its turret.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MONSTER MAN
{META_DATA}: (to Dog)
{DIALOGUE}: Bozo!
{DIALOGUE}: Get back here!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His eyes passing on Chris like so much meat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MONSTER MAN (CONT'D)
{META_DATA}: (to Chris)
{DIALOGUE}: Can you walk outta here?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chris nods.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Soldier pointing to the LZ behind him as a sign he should go that way.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The other Soldier already stripping the NVA dead, as the APC grinds on into the jungle, reconnoitering.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chris walks out of the jungle, head bowed, nauseated, mixed feelings roiling him.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. PERIMETER #3 - FRANCIS' FOXHOLE - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In another foxhole, Francis waits, the sounds of the approaching APC cutting through.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He thinks about it a moment.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It must be fast.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It must be a hard cold decision.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pulls out his K-bar and with one last anguished hesitation, drives it into his thigh muscle.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Francis yells out and collapses in his hole.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. PERIMETER #3 - O'NEILL'S FOXHOLE - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In another foxhole, O'Neill, unscratched but covered with dirt, waits tentatively as SOLDIERS arrive at his hole.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They're a little awed by the sight of the tough-looking O'Neill emerging from his foxhole like Sgt.Rock, dozens of dead NVA littered around him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: APC SOLDIER #1
{DIALOGUE}: You alone Sarge?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: O'NEILL
{DIALOGUE}: Fuck yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: They all left me, bunch of fuckin'

{CHARACTER_NAME}: O'NEILL
{DIALOGUE}: Fuck the silver star.
{DIALOGUE}: You got any booze?
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. PERIMETER #3 - RHAH'S FOXHOLE - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Rhah, alive and well, is poking around the NVA corpses with a long gnarled walking stick, looking like a crazy Johnny Appleseed with his pants rolled up on his thin hairy ankles and wearing a red bandana tied in a four-knot around his head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As one of the APC SOLDIERS carves an ear off a dead NVA, Rhah works his way through the torn bloody pocket of an NVA Troop in full rigor mortis, extracting what he thought was there - a wrapped cellophane of heroin.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Rhah's face glows with satisfaction as he tastes it, then snorts it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With a certain satisfaction of triumph over the grim circumstances.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RHAH
{META_DATA}: (to the powder)
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, that's good shit ...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. PERIMETER #3 - LZ - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CHRIS is hauled out on a litter.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Morphined, his eyes watching it all from somewhere deep in his brain.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Passing:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Groups of SOLDIERS looking like bowery bums and moving like rats through the smoke and garbage snooping for souvenirs with wheezy tired eyes and grunts of greed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Passing a bulldozed PIT with heaps of NVA BODIES in them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: a BULLDOZER pushing another set of bodies in, like photos of a Nazi death camp.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Nearby, two burly SOLDIERS lift a WOMAN NURSE and with a once- through build for momentum, toss the fresh body into the pit.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chris, numb, goes by.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RADIO OPERATOR
{META_DATA}: (into radio, exhausted)
{DIALOGUE}: - 37 U.S. KIA, 122 wounded and still counting.
{DIALOGUE}: Estimate 500 Victor Charlie KIA, 22 wounded and still counting.
{DIALOGUE}: Over.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: 2ND RADIO OPERATOR
{DIALOGUE}: Sir, a television crew's coming in with the General -
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CAPTAIN HARRIS doesn't respond; at this point he doesn't give a shit, standing apart from the radios looking numbly at the remnants of his boys filtering by on litters.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chris intersects him now, Harris' eyes looking blankly, then nodding sickly trying to give him encouragement.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just coming to the edge of tears, choking it back, and turning back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: These are his sons who are lost.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A good officer.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Rodriguez, wounded, is lifted up in his litter and moved out to the waiting MEDIVAC CHOPPER, a huge red cross painted on a white square.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Doc goes by on another litter, then Ace, Adams, Huffmeister, etc.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then Francis is littered by, bandages around his leg, a big smile on his face.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FRANCIS
{DIALOGUE}: Hey Taylor, you okay man?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRIS
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: How 'bout you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FRANCIS
{DIALOGUE}: Jes' fine man, jes fine!
{DIALOGUE}: Ain't never felt better!
{DIALOGUE}: Both of us two timers man, we're out.
{META_DATA}: (gives him a slap as he goes by)
{DIALOGUE}: See you at the hospital man, we gonna get high-high yessir ...
{META_DATA}: (goes off)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Medic points to the chopper.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MEDIC
{META_DATA}: (to Chris)
{DIALOGUE}: That's your ride man, you ready?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRIS
{META_DATA}: (tries a smile)
{DIALOGUE}: You bet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chris starts towards it, the Medic assisting him.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. PERIMETER #3 - LZ - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sgt.O'Neill watches the loading process forlornly from the distance.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Captain Harris intersects him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRIS
{DIALOGUE}: You got Second Platoon Sergeant.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: O'NEILL
{META_DATA}: (reflexively)
{DIALOGUE}: Yes sir -
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And as Harris moves away, O'Neill is left thinking.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Finally there is a certain frustration to his actions; he has taken such great pains to stay alive that the tuition he pays is precisely to stay in this Jungle.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Inevitably his time will come - one way or another.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His eyes now follow the MEDIVAC CHOPPER upwards, whatever is left of his shrunken soul yearning to go with it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: EXT/INT: PERIMETER #3 LZ CHOPPER - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the Chopper rises off the battlefield, Chris, who is sitting at the edge so that he has a full view out the open door, waves back at Rhah.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. PERIMETER #3 - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Rhah, at the edge of the treeline, vigorously shakes his walking stick at him, his other hand a fist, waving them, emitting his cry.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RHAH
{DIALOGUE}: Baaaaaaaaa!!!!!!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Defiance.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Pride.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dig me, I'm Rhah - and there isn't nobody like me in the world.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: EXT/INT: PERIMETER #3 - LZ CHOPPER - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The chopper - with its huge red cross painted on - now rising to meet God.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Smashed on morphine, Chris looking out at the waving ants below.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now the trees, the skyline and the chopper is moving fast over the devestation.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The jungle forever locked in his memory, Chris looks back, copious, quiet tears flowing from his eyes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHRIS (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: I think now, looking back, we did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves - and the enemy was in us ... The war is over for me now, but it will always be there - the rest of my days.
{DIALOGUE}: As I am sure Elias will be - fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called possession of my soul ... There are times since I have felt like the child born of those two fathers ... but be that as it may, those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning to this life ...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The music surges now to its full strength as we replay bits of film with each actor's name listed - some with silly, clowning looks, others sober, haunted.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gardner, Tex, King, Rhah, Lerner, Sanderson, Manny, Big Harold - all the boys ... and then Barnes staring quietly into the camera, and lastly Elias - shirt off, bowl of grass in hand, his big, beautiful smile.
{META_DATA}: FADE OUT:
