{CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA
{DIALOGUE}: Don't you hate that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT
{DIALOGUE}: What?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA
{DIALOGUE}: Uncomfortable silences.
{DIALOGUE}: Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA
{DIALOGUE}: That's when you know you found somebody special.
{DIALOGUE}: When you can just shit the fuck up for a minute, and comfortably share silence.

{DIALOGUE}: I don't think we're there yet.
{DIALOGUE}: But don't feel bad, we just met each other.

{DIALOGUE}: Did ya think of something to say?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT
{DIALOGUE}: Actually, there's something I've wanted to ask you about, but you seem like a nice person, and I didn't want to offend you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA
{DIALOGUE}: Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like mindless, boring, getting-to-know- you chit-chat.
{DIALOGUE}: This sounds like you actually have something to say.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT
{DIALOGUE}: Only if you promise not to get offended.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA
{DIALOGUE}: You can't promise something like that.
{DIALOGUE}: I have no idea what you're gonna ask.
{DIALOGUE}: You could ask me what you're gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to be offended.
{DIALOGUE}: Then, through no fault of my own, I woulda broken my promise.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT
{DIALOGUE}: Then let's just forget it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA
{DIALOGUE}: That is an impossibility.
{DIALOGUE}: Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT
{DIALOGUE}: Is that a fact?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mia nods her head: "Yes."
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA
{DIALOGUE}: Besides, it's more exciting when you don't have permission.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT
{DIALOGUE}: What do you think about what happened to Antwan?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA
{DIALOGUE}: Who's Antwan?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT
{DIALOGUE}: Tony Rocky Horror.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA
{DIALOGUE}: He fell out of a window.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT
{DIALOGUE}: That's one way to say it.
{DIALOGUE}: Another way is, he was thrown out.
{DIALOGUE}: Another was is, he was thrown out by Marsellus.
{DIALOGUE}: And even another way is, he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA
{DIALOGUE}: Is that a fact?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT

{CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA
{DIALOGUE}: Who told you this?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT
{DIALOGUE}: They.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mia and Vincent smile.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA
{DIALOGUE}: They talk a lot, don't they?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT
{DIALOGUE}: They certainly do.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA
{DIALOGUE}: Well don't by shy Vincent, what exactly did they say?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Vincent is slow to answer.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA
{DIALOGUE}: Let me help you Bashful, did it involve the F-word?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: They just said Rocky Horror gave you a foot massage.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA
{DIALOGUE}: And...?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT
{DIALOGUE}: No and, that's it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA
{DIALOGUE}: You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror out of a four-story window because he massaged my feet?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA
{DIALOGUE}: And you believed that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT
{DIALOGUE}: At the time I was told, it seemed reasonable.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA
{DIALOGUE}: Marsellus throwing Tony out of a four story window for giving me a foot massage seemed reasonable?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT
{DIALOGUE}: No, it seemed excessive.
{DIALOGUE}: But that doesn't mean it didn't happen.
{DIALOGUE}: I heard Marsellus is very protective of you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA
{DIALOGUE}: A husband being protective of his wife is one thing.
{DIALOGUE}: A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT
{DIALOGUE}: But did it happen?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MIA
{DIALOGUE}: The only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand, when he shook it.
{DIALOGUE}: I met Anwan once – at my wedding – then never again.
{DIALOGUE}: The truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus tossed Tony Rocky Horror out of that window except Marsellus and Tony Rocky Horror.
{DIALOGUE}: But when you scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She SLAPS the lighter against her leg, trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did.

{DIALOGUE}: We were in that Hanoi pit of hell over five years together.
{DIALOGUE}: Hopefully, you'll never have to experience this yourself, but when two men are in a situation like me and your Daddy were, for as long as we were, you take on certain responsibilities of the other.
{DIALOGUE}: If it had been me who had not made it, Major Coolidge would be talkin' right now to my son Jim.
{DIALOGUE}: But the way it worked out is I'm talkin' to you, Butch.
{DIALOGUE}: I got somethin' for ya.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CAPT. KOONS
{DIALOGUE}: This watch I got here was first purchased by your great-granddaddy.

{DIALOGUE}: And in that can it stayed 'til your grandfather Dane Coolidge was called upon by his country to go overseas and fight the Germans once again.
{DIALOGUE}: This time they called it World War Two.
{DIALOGUE}: Your great-granddaddy gave it to your granddad for good luck.

{DIALOGUE}: Your granddad was a Marine and he was killed with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake Island.
{DIALOGUE}: Your granddad was facing death and he knew it.
{DIALOGUE}: None of those boys had any illusions about ever leavin' that island alive.
{DIALOGUE}: So three days before the Japanese took the island, your 22-year old grandfather asked a gunner on an Air Force transport named Winocki, a man he had never met before in his life, to deliver to his infant son, who he had never seen in the flesh, his gold watch.
{DIALOGUE}: Three days later, your grandfather was dead.
{DIALOGUE}: But Winocki kept his word.
{DIALOGUE}: After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother, delivering to your infant father, his Dad's gold watch.
{DIALOGUE}: This watch.
{DIALOGUE}: This watch was on your Daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi.
{DIALOGUE}: He was captured and put in a Vietnamese prison camp.
{DIALOGUE}: Now he knew if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd be confiscated.
{DIALOGUE}: The way your Daddy looked at it, that watch was your birthright.
{DIALOGUE}: And he'd be damned if and slopeheads were gonna put their greasy yella hands on his boy's birthright.
{DIALOGUE}: So he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide somethin'.
{DIALOGUE}: His ass.
{DIALOGUE}: Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass.
{DIALOGUE}: Then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch.
{DIALOGUE}: I hid with uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass for two years.
{DIALOGUE}: Then, after seven years, I was sent home to my family.
{DIALOGUE}: And now, little man, I give the watch to you.

{META_DATA}: (meaning Jules and Vincent)
{DIALOGUE}: Take the body, stick it in the trunk.
{DIALOGUE}: Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty domesticated house.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JIMMIE
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: Exactly.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JULES

{DIALOGUE}: You're judging this thing the wrong way.
{DIALOGUE}: It's not about what.
{DIALOGUE}: It could be God stopped the bullets, he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found my fuckin' car keys.
{DIALOGUE}: You don't judge shit like this based on merit.
{DIALOGUE}: Whether or not what we experienced was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant.
{DIALOGUE}: What is significant is I felt God's touch, God got involved.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT
{DIALOGUE}: But why?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JULES
{DIALOGUE}: That's what's fuckin' wit' me!

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JULES

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JULES
{DIALOGUE}: All shapes and sizes, Vince.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: PUMPKIN
{DIALOGUE}: Not regularly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JULES
{DIALOGUE}: There's a passage I got memorized.
{DIALOGUE}: Ezekiel 25:17.
{DIALOGUE}: "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
{DIALOGUE}: Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness.
{DIALOGUE}: For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.
{DIALOGUE}: And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.
{DIALOGUE}: And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you."
{DIALOGUE}: I been sayin' that shit for years.
{DIALOGUE}: And if you ever heard it, it meant your ass.
{DIALOGUE}: I never really questioned what it meant.
{DIALOGUE}: I thought it was just a coldblooded thing to say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped a cap in his ass.
{DIALOGUE}: But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice.
{DIALOGUE}: Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're the evil man.
{DIALOGUE}: And I'm the righteous man.
{DIALOGUE}: And Mr. .45 here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness.
{DIALOGUE}: Or is could by you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish.
{DIALOGUE}: I'd like that.
{DIALOGUE}: But that shit ain't the truth.
{DIALOGUE}: The truth is you're the weak.
{DIALOGUE}: And I'm the tyranny of evil men.
{DIALOGUE}: But I'm tryin'.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm tryin' real hard to be a shepherd.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to Yolanda.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She looks back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the door.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pushes it aside.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Vincent appears next to Jules.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VINCENT
{DIALOGUE}: I think we oughta leave now.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JULES
{DIALOGUE}: That's probably a good idea.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the briefcase.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes – wearing UC Santa Cruz and "I'm with Stupid" tee-shirts, swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics – walk out of the coffee shop together without saying a word.
{META_DATA}: FADE OUT
{META_DATA}: THE END
