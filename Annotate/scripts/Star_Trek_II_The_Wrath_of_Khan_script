{DIALOGUE}: I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: And why not?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SAAVIK
{DIALOGUE}: Because... there was no way to win.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face.
{DIALOGUE}: Has that never occurred to you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SAAVIK
{DIALOGUE}: ... No, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: It has not.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SAAVIK
{META_DATA}: (falters)
{DIALOGUE}: As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: Then you have something new to think about.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{DIALOGUE}: The Kobayshi Maru scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.
{META_DATA}: (dry)
{DIALOGUE}: As I recall you took the test three times yourself.
{DIALOGUE}: Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{META_DATA}: (solemn)
{DIALOGUE}: It had the virtue of never having been tried.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{DIALOGUE}: Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: So you said at the time.
{DIALOGUE}: Speaking of which, your prot‚g‚'s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{DIALOGUE}: She's half Romulan, Jim.
{DIALOGUE}: The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{META_DATA}: (reads)
{DIALOGUE}: 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{DIALOGUE}: None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk looks around uncomfortably, overlaps:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{DIALOGUE}: The Enterprise.
{DIALOGUE}: I must check in before your inspection.
{DIALOGUE}: And you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{META_DATA}: (shortly)

{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERRELL
{DIALOGUE}: Damn!
{DIALOGUE}: Are you sure?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHEKOV
{DIALOGUE}: I suppose it could be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERRELL
{DIALOGUE}: All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On the monitor: Terrell and Chekov, looking hopeful.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERRELL
{DIALOGUE}: It might only be a particle of preanimate matter...

{CHARACTER_NAME}: BONES
{META_DATA}: (broad)
{DIALOGUE}: I only use it for medicinal purposes.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't be a pring...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{META_DATA}: (reading the label with difficulty)

{DIALOGUE}: For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: But I'm allergic to Retlax.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BONES
{DIALOGUE}: Exactly.
{DIALOGUE}: Happy birthday.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He toasts.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk is unsure how they work.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BONES
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: Slide them down your nose.
{DIALOGUE}: Now look at me over the top.
{DIALOGUE}: And you read printed matter through the bottom.

{DIALOGUE}: Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BONES
{DIALOGUE}: What DO you want?
{DIALOGUE}: Damn it, why isn't there a girl here?
{DIALOGUE}: You know this has nothing to do with age.
{DIALOGUE}: This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They pass but do not notice the FEDERATION LOGO, half buried next to their feet.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERRELL
{DIALOGUE}: They look like cargo carriers...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Chekov looks at the porthole, a face suddenly looks back!

{DIALOGUE}: What the hell is this?
{DIALOGUE}: Did they crash?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERRELL
{DIALOGUE}: What do you want with us?
{DIALOGUE}: I demand --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KHAN
{META_DATA}: (mild)
{DIALOGUE}: You are in a position to demand nothing, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing.
{DIALOGUE}: What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the Botany Bay, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERRELL
{DIALOGUE}: Listen to me -- you men and women --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KHAN
{DIALOGUE}: Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born.
{DIALOGUE}: Do you mean he...
{META_DATA}: (i.e. Chekov)
{DIALOGUE}: ... never told you the tale?
{DIALOGUE}: To amuse you, Captain?
{DIALOGUE}: Never told you how the Enterprise picked up the Botany Bay, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERRELL
{DIALOGUE}: I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KHAN
{DIALOGUE}: Admiral?
{DIALOGUE}: He didn't tell you how Admiral Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHEKOV
{DIALOGUE}: You lie!
{DIALOGUE}: On Ceti Alpha V there was life, a fair chance to --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KHAN
{DIALOGUE}: This is Ceti Alpha V!
{DIALOGUE}: Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here.
{DIALOGUE}: The shock shifted the orbit of this planet and everything was laid waste.
{DIALOGUE}: Admiral Kirk never bothered to check on our progress.
{DIALOGUE}: It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive!
{DIALOGUE}: On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHEKOV
{DIALOGUE}: Captain Kirk was your host!
{DIALOGUE}: You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KHAN
{META_DATA}: (moves closer)
{DIALOGUE}: And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: KHAN
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: You didn't expect to find me.
{DIALOGUE}: You thought this was Ceti Alpha VI.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They don't answer.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Khan goes over to Terrell and, WITH ONE HAND, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR --

{DIALOGUE}: Why?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terrell gasps, stays silent --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KHAN
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: No matter.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He lets go; Terrell falls with a thud --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KHAN
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: You will soon tell me willingly enough.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He goes over to the tank and dips a kind of strainer in, pulling out TWO CETI EELS -- wriggling items --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KHAN
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: Let me introduce you to Ceti Alpha V's only remaining indigenous life form; what do you think?
{DIALOGUE}: They've killed twenty of my people, including my beloved wife.
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, not all at once and not instantly, to be sure.
{DIALOGUE}: Their young enter through the ears and wrap themselves around the cerebral cortex.
{DIALOGUE}: This has the effect of rendering the victim extremely susceptible to suggestion.
{DIALOGUE}: Later, as they grow, follows madness, paralysis -- and death.
{DIALOGUE}: These are pets, of course -- not quite domesticated.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he speaks, Khan dumps an eel in each of their helmets; he swirls the helmets around as though he were mixing martinis --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHEKOV
{DIALOGUE}: Khan, listen to me!
{DIALOGUE}: Captain Kirk was only doing his duty!
{DIALOGUE}: You --
{META_DATA}: 26 CLOSE UP - KHAN - CAMERA IN
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KHAN
{DIALOGUE}: There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end.
{DIALOGUE}: That was what I learned from watching my wife.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At a sign, the helmets are slammed down.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the muffled shrieks are heard from within, the eels crawl across the faces of Chekov and Terrell; with unerring in- stincts they head for the ears of the two hapless men.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is some atrocious pain as they enter -- then dazed calm.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KHAN
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: That's better!

{CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{DIALOGUE}: Don't grieve, Admiral -- it's logical: the good of the many outweighs --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He almost keels over.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk has tears streaming down his face.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: ... the good of the few...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{DIALOGUE}: Or the one.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He props a hand on the glass to support himself.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk's hand reflexively goes to match Spock's on the other side of the glass --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SPOCK
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: I never took the Kobayashi Maru test -- until now.
{DIALOGUE}: What do you think of my solution?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: Spock...!

{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: And yet, in the midst of our sorrow it should be noted that this death takes place in the shadow of new life, the sunrise of a new world, a world that our beloved comrade gave his own life to protect and nourish.
{DIALOGUE}: He did not feel that sacrifice a vain or empty one -- and we will not debate his profound wisdom, in these proceedings.
{DIALOGUE}: Of my friend, I can only say this, that of all the souls I have encountered in my travels, his was the most --
{META_DATA}: (he falters)

{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK

{DIALOGUE}: Aye, sir.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 245 INT. KIRK'S QUARTERS
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After a long moment, the CAMERA DISCOVERS Kirk.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pours a drink, then decides not to have it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He sits wearily, not knowing how to shake the ghosts.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he sees the book.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk picks up the battered volume, the gift from his friend, and closes his eyes a moment.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Almost idly he starts turning pages, looking for a clue.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But he can't see the writing -- he rummages through his pockets and pulls out the half-glasses --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: One of the lenses is broken.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It has a deep impact on Kirk.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He puts down the book and glasses and covers his eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A SOFT BONG.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: David's strength is turning a corner with Kirk --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: I suppose I was.
{META_DATA}: (pause)
{DIALOGUE}: I poured a drink.
{DIALOGUE}: Would you like it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DAVID
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{META_DATA}: (rueful)
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't expect anything.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DAVID
{DIALOGUE}: That makes two of us.
{META_DATA}: (he studies his father)
{DIALOGUE}: Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{META_DATA}: (hoarse)
{DIALOGUE}: Not like this -- no.
{DIALOGUE}: I haven't faced death, I cheated death.
{DIALOGUE}: I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity.
{DIALOGUE}: I know nothing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DAVID
{DIALOGUE}: You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: It was just words.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DAVID
{DIALOGUE}: But good words.
{DIALOGUE}: That's where ideas begin.
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe you should listen to them.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: I'm trying, David.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DAVID
{DIALOGUE}: So am I. My friends were killed, too.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: I am truly sorry.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Pause.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They study each other.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DAVID
{DIALOGUE}: I was wrong about you.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: Is that what you came here to say?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DAVID
{DIALOGUE}: Mainly.
{META_DATA}: (he starts out, then turns -- )

{CHARACTER_NAME}: SAAVIK
{DIALOGUE}: Aye, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: On course to Ceti Alpha.
{DIALOGUE}: All is well.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Saavik comes close to blushing --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SAAVIK
{DIALOGUE}: Aye, sir --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She takes him off, deadpan amusement --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SAAVIK
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: So you turn out to be the dumb bastard.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They stare at her.

{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: That is a little joke.

{META_DATA}: (pause)
{DIALOGUE}: Will you look at that?
{DIALOGUE}: Think they'll name it for you, Doctor?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CAROL
{DIALOGUE}: Not if I can help it.
{DIALOGUE}: We'll name it for our friend.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{META_DATA}: (quietly)
{DIALOGUE}: It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CAROL
{META_DATA}: (soft)
{DIALOGUE}: Is that a poem?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: Something Spock was trying to tell me.
{DIALOGUE}: On my birthday.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He shakes his head, remembering --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BONES
{DIALOGUE}: You okay, Jim?
{DIALOGUE}: How do you feel?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{META_DATA}: (considers; smiles)
{DIALOGUE}: Young.
{DIALOGUE}: I feel young, Doctor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns to Saavik and David --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: Lieutenant, new course: 'Second star to the right and straight on till morning.'
