{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ariadne THINKS, unable to remember.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A FAINT RUMBLE begins.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: Oh my God.
{DIALOGUE}: We're dreaming.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cobb nods.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The RUMBLE is BUILDING.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Stay calm.
{DIALOGUE}: We're actually asleep in the workshop.
{DIALOGUE}: This is your first lesson in shared dreaming, remember?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ariadne looks around, mind REELING.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cobb BRACES-
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The restaurant VIOLENTLY FRAGMENTS, EXPLODING AND IMPLODING PARTICLES OF FURNITURE, WALLS, PEOPLE FLYING AROUND- Ariadne WONDERS at the MAYHEM WHIRLING around them- Cobb SHIELDS his head against the debris.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She sees him-
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{META_DATA}: (shouting over noise)
{DIALOGUE}: If it's just a dream, why are you covering your-
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ariadne is WIPED FROM HER SEAT BY A MASSIVE BLAST and we-

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. WORKSHOP - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ariadne JOLTS awake.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: Because it's never just a dream.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ariadne turns to Cobb's voice.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are both sitting in the lawn chairs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Arthur watches over them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 33.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: And a face full of glass hurts like hell, doesn't it?
{DIALOGUE}: While we're in it, it's real.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: That's why the military developed dream sharing-a training program where soldiers could strangle, stab and shoot each other, then wake up.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: How did architects get involved?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Someone had to design the dreams.
{META_DATA}: (to Arthur)
{DIALOGUE}: Let's go another five minutes-
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: We were only asleep for five minutes?
{DIALOGUE}: We talked for an hour at least...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: When you dream, your mind functions more quickly, so time seems to pass more slowly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: Five minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Let's see how much trouble you can cause in five minutes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And we-
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. SAME PARISIAN STREET - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ariadne walks down the crowded street with Cobb.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cobb looks around at the street, the cafe, approving.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: It's good.
{DIALOGUE}: You've got the cafe, the layout... you forgot the book shop but pretty much everything else is here.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ariadne looks at the passers-by.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: Who are the people?
{DIALOGUE}: 34.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: They're projections of my subconscious.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: Yours?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Sure-you are the dreamer, I am the subject.
{DIALOGUE}: My subconscious populates your world.
{DIALOGUE}: That's one way we get at a subject's thoughts-his mind creates the people, so we can literally talk to his subconscious.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: How else do you do it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Architecture.
{DIALOGUE}: Build a bank vault or a jail, something secure, and the subject's mind will fill it with information he's trying to protect.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: Then you break in and steal it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Exactly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ariadne wonders at the detail of the street.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: I love the concrete sense of things-
{META_DATA}: (stamps foot)
{DIALOGUE}: Real weight, you know?
{DIALOGUE}: I thought a dream space would be all about the visual, but it's the feel of things.
{DIALOGUE}: Question is, what happens as you start to mess with physics...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She CONCENTRATES on the street.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The street starts to BEND IN HALF- the buildings on either side FOLDING IN until they form the INSIDE OF A CUBE OF CITY, GRAVITY FUNCTIONING INDEPENDENTLY ON EACH PLANE.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ariadne looks up (or down) at the people on the opposite city surface.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cobb watches her excitement.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: It's something, isn't it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{META_DATA}: (quiet)
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{DIALOGUE}: It is.
{DIALOGUE}: 35.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As they walk, Ariadne notices more and more of the projections STARING at her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: Why are they looking at me?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Because you're changing things.
{DIALOGUE}: My subconscious feels that someone else is creating the world.
{DIALOGUE}: The more you change things, the quicker the projections converge on you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: Converge?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: They feel the foreign nature of the dreamer, and attack-like white blood cells fighting an infection.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: They're going to attack us?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Just you, actually.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They walk along the street to where it joins the next gravitational plane.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They step up onto the different plane and walk down the street towards a river.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Ariadne approaches, steps emerge from the flagstone, and she leads Cobb up onto a small jetty.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As she concentrates, pillars emerge and a BRIDGE starts to telescope out from the jetty.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They step onto it as it grows.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cobb is impressed.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: It's beautiful... but if you keep on changing things...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: People crossing the bridge STARE at Ariadne.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Several of them BUMP her shoulder as they pass.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: Mind telling your subconscious to take it easy?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: That's why it's called subconscious.
{DIALOGUE}: I don't control it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The bridge now spans the Seine.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cobb marvels at it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Arched stone, iron pillars... it's... 36.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cobb pauses, thinking.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Remembering.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INSERT CUT: Mal, hair blowing, turns to Cobb, smiling, laughing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He smiles back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are on the same bridge.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: I know this bridge.
{DIALOGUE}: This place is real-
{META_DATA}: (serious)
{DIALOGUE}: You didn't imagine it, you remembered it...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{META_DATA}: (nods)
{DIALOGUE}: I cross it every day on my way to the college.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Never recreate places from your memory.
{DIALOGUE}: Always imagine new places.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: You have to draw from what you know-
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{META_DATA}: (tense)
{DIALOGUE}: Use pieces-a streetlamp, phonebooths, a type of brick-not whole areas.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Several people around them ECHO Cobb's attitude...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: Why not?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Because building dreams out of your own memories is the surest way to lose your grip on what's real and what's a dream.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: Did that happen to you?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cobb says nothing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stands there, starinq at Ariadne.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: PEOPLE around her stop and look at her, hostile.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Look, this isn't about me-
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cobb reaches for Ariadne's arm, turns her to him-
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: Is that why you need me to build your dreams?
{DIALOGUE}: 37.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A passerby GRABS Ariadne's shoulder-
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Leave her alone-
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: More of the crowd join in, PULLING at Ariadne, holding her arms open- Cobb PULLS people off- the crowd PUSHES him away- Cobb sees someone WALKING PURPOSEFULLY through the crowd towards the helpless, Ariadne- it is Mal.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She approaches with even strides- Ariadne stares at her, uneasy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: Wake me up, Cobb.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Mal walks, she pulls out a LARGE KNIFE-
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Mal, no!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: Wake me up!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ariadne SCREAMS as Mal LUNGES at her with the knife and we-

{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: It's okay.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: Why couldn't I wake?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: The only way to wake from inside the dream is to die.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cobb, in the lawn chair opposite, PULLS his tubes out.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: She'll need a totem.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: What?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: Some kind of personal icon.
{DIALOGUE}: A small object that you can always have with you, and that no one else knows,
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cobb gets to his feet, Ariadne stares at him, furious.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He heads to the bathroom.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 38.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: That's some subconscious you've got, Cobb.
{META_DATA}: (calls after him)
{DIALOGUE}: She's a real charmer!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: Sounds like you've met Mrs. Cobb.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{META_DATA}: (surprised)
{DIALOGUE}: She's his wife?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Arthur nods, pulling off Ariadne's tubes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: So.
{DIALOGUE}: A totem.
{DIALOGUE}: You need something small, potentially heavy...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cobb takes out his PEWTER SPINNING TOP, SPINS it on the marble counter...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ariadne looks at Arthur, puzzled.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: Like a coin?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: Too common.
{DIALOGUE}: You need something that has a weight or movement that only you know.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cobb STUDIES the spin of the top as it decays, becoming more and more ECCENTRIC...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Arthur holds out a DIE.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: A loaded die.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ariadne reaches for it- Arthur snatches sit away- 39.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: I can't let you handle it.
{DIALOGUE}: That's the point.
{DIALOGUE}: No one else can know the weight or balance of it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: Why?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: So when you examine your totem...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cobb's spinning top WOBBLES OVER.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: You know, beyond a doubt, that you're not in someone else's dream.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cobb GRABS it like a drowning man reaching for a lifeline.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ariadne thinks this over.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: That's not an issue for me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: Why not?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: Arthur, maybe you can't see what's going on, maybe you don't want to.
{DIALOGUE}: But Cobb's got problems he's tried to bury down there.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not going to open my mind to someone like that.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ariadne gets to her feet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Walks away.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: She'll be back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Arthur turns.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cobb is standing in the bathroom doorway.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: I've never seen anyone pick it up so fast.
{DIALOGUE}: And one reality won't be enough for her now.
{DIALOGUE}: When she comes back, get her building mazes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: Where will you be?
{DIALOGUE}: 40.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: I've got to talk to Eames.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: Eames?

{DIALOGUE}: Cobol's backyard.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Necessary risk.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: There are plenty of other thieves.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: We don't just need a thief.
{DIALOGUE}: We need a forger.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Crowded, bustling, smoke-filled.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: a westerner (40's), shabby suit, is squeezed in at a dice game.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is EAMES.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He FIDDLES with his last two chips.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: Rub them against each other all you like, they're not going to breed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Eames looks up to see Cobb.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EAMES
{DIALOGUE}: You never know.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Eames tosses down his last chips.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The dice are rolled...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB

{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Don't bother telling me it's impossible.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EAMES
{DIALOGUE}: It's perfectly possible.
{DIALOGUE}: Just bloody difficult.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: That's what I keep saying to Arthur.
{DIALOGUE}: 42.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EAMES
{DIALOGUE}: Arthur?
{DIALOGUE}: You're still working with that stick-in-the-mud?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: He's a good point man.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EAMES
{DIALOGUE}: The best.
{DIALOGUE}: But he has no imagination.
{DIALOGUE}: If you're going to perform inception, you need imagination.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: You've done it before?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EAMES
{DIALOGUE}: Yeas and no.
{DIALOGUE}: We tried it.
{DIALOGUE}: Got the idea in place, but it didn't take.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: You didn't plant it deep enough?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EAMES
{DIALOGUE}: It's not just about depth.
{DIALOGUE}: You need the simplest version of the idea- the one that will grow naturally in the subject's mind.
{DIALOGUE}: Subtle art.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: That's why I'm here.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EAMES
{DIALOGUE}: What's the idea you need to plant?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: We want the heir to a major corporation to break up his father's empire.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EAMES
{DIALOGUE}: See, right there you've got various political motivations, anti- monopolistic sentiment and so forth.
{DIALOGUE}: But all that stuff's at the mercy of the subject's prejudice- you have to go to the basic.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Which is?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EAMES
{DIALOGUE}: The relationship with the father.
{META_DATA}: (downs drink)
{DIALOGUE}: Do you have a chemist?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: I tried not to come.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: What sort of tricks?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They take a tight turn and continue down the next flight.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: In a dream, you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes.
{META_DATA}: (MORE)
{DIALOGUE}: 46.

{DIALOGUE}: That lets you create closed loops, like the Penrose Steps.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ariadne puzzles at the impossible construction of the stairs.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Arthur gestures at the drop.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: Paradox.
{DIALOGUE}: A closed loop like this helps you disguise the boundaries of the dream you've created.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: How big do the levels have to be?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: Anything from the floor of a building, to an entire city.
{DIALOGUE}: But it has to be complicated enough for us to hide from the projections.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: A maze.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: And the better the maze-
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: The longer we have before the projections catch us.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sees people LOOKING at Arthur.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE

{DIALOGUE}: Cobb can't build anymore, can he?
{DIALOGUE}: 47.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know if he can't, but he won't.
{DIALOGUE}: He thinks it's safer if he doesn't know the layouts.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: Why?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: He won't tell me.
{DIALOGUE}: I think it's Mal.
{DIALOGUE}: I think she's getting stronger.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: His ex-wife?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: She's not his ex.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: They're still together?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Arthur turns to Ariadne.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gentle.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: No, she's dead, Ariadne.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: What's your problem with Fischer?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SAITO
{DIALOGUE}: That's not your concern.
{DIALOGUE}: 48.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: This isn't the usual corporate espionage, Mr. Saito.
{DIALOGUE}: This is inception.
{DIALOGUE}: The seed of the idea we plant will grow in this man's mind.
{DIALOGUE}: It'll change him.
{DIALOGUE}: It might even come to define him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Saito looks at Cobb.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SAITO
{DIALOGUE}: My sources suggest you might not have always been so cautious.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Then you need new sources, Mr. Saito.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Saito considers Cobb.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shrugs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SAITO
{DIALOGUE}: Fischer Morrow has the regulators in their pockets.
{DIALOGUE}: We're the last company standing between them and total energy dominance and we can no longer compete.
{DIALOGUE}: Soon they'll control the energy supply of half the world.
{DIALOGUE}: They'll be able to blackmail governments, dictate policy.
{DIALOGUE}: In effect, they become a new superpower.
{DIALOGUE}: The world needs Robert Fischer to change his mind.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EAMES
{DIALOGUE}: That's where we come in.
{DIALOGUE}: How's Robert Fischer's relationship to his father?

{DIALOGUE}: Just spin and spin...

{DIALOGUE}: Arthur told me she died.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: She did.
{DIALOGUE}: How are the mazes coming?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ariadne indicates three large ARCHITECTURAL MODELS.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: Good.

{DIALOGUE}: I'm making the bottom level a hospital, so that Fischer will bring his father there-
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Don't tell me.
{DIALOGUE}: Remember, you only want the dreamer to know the layout.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: Why's that so important?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: In case one of us brings in part of our subconscious.
{DIALOGUE}: You wouldn't want any projections knowing the layout.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: In case you bring Mal in.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cobb says nothing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: You won't build yourself because if you know the maze, then she knows it.
{DIALOGUE}: And she'd sabotage the operation.
{DIALOGUE}: You can't keep her out, can you?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cobb says nothing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: Do the others know?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: No. 56.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: You have to warn them if it's getting worse-
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{META_DATA}: (gentle)

{DIALOGUE}: Look, Ariadne, I need them for this job.
{DIALOGUE}: I need you for this job.
{DIALOGUE}: Without your help, I'll never get back to my children.
{DIALOGUE}: And that's all I can care about right now.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: Why can't you go home, Cobb?

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cobb turns to the team.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 57.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: An idea Robert Fischer's conscious mind would never accept.
{DIALOGUE}: We have to plant it deep in his subconscious.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: How deep?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Three levels down.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: A dream within a dream within a dream?
{DIALOGUE}: Is that even possible?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{DIALOGUE}: It is.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Now, the subconscious motivates through emotion, not reason, so we have to translate the idea into an emotional concept.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: How do you translate a business strategy into an emotion?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: That's what we have to figure out.
{DIALOGUE}: Robert and his father have a tense relationship.
{DIALOGUE}: Worse, even, than the gossip columns have suggested...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EAMES
{DIALOGUE}: Do you play on that?
{DIALOGUE}: Suggest breaking up his father's company as a 'screw you' to the old man?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: Positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time.
{DIALOGUE}: We yearn for people to be reconciled, for catharsis.
{DIALOGUE}: We need positive emotional logic.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Eames thinks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Paces.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Looking back at the board.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EAMES
{DIALOGUE}: Try this... "MY FATHER ACCEPTS THAT I WANT TO CREATE FOR MYSELF, NOT FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS."
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: That might work.
{DIALOGUE}: 58.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: Might?
{DIALOGUE}: We'll have to do better than that.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EAMES
{DIALOGUE}: Thanks for the contribution, Arthur.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: Forgive me for wanting a little specificity, Eames.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Inception's not about specificity.
{DIALOGUE}: When we get inside his head, we're going to have to work with what we find.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Arthur shrugs, frustrated.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And we-
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The team are in the middle of a DESERTED intersection.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ariadne is showing Yusuf aspects of the geography.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EAMES
{DIALOGUE}: We could split the idea into emotional triggers, and use one on each level.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: How do you mean?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EAMES
{DIALOGUE}: On the top level, we open up his relationship with his father....
{DIALOGUE}: Say: "I WILL NOT FOLLOW IN MY FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS."
{DIALOGUE}: Next level down we've accessed his ambition and self-esteem.
{DIALOGUE}: We feed him: "I WILL CREATE SOMETHING MYSELF."
{DIALOGUE}: Then, the bottom level, we bring out the emotional big guns...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: "MY FATHER DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE HIM."
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EAMES
{DIALOGUE}: That could do it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: How do you produce these emotional triggers?
{DIALOGUE}: 59.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EAMES
{DIALOGUE}: I forge each emotional concept in the style and manner of Peter Browning, a key figure in Fischer's emotional life.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Two AFRICAN PEDESTRIANS wander into view.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: Are those yours?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Eames shakes his head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cobb turns to Yusuf.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: Yusuf?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YUSUF
{DIALOGUE}: Yup.
{DIALOGUE}: Sorry.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Suppress them.
{DIALOGUE}: We don't bring our own projections into the dream-we let Fischer's subconscious supply the people.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EAMES
{DIALOGUE}: Saito, when do I get to see Browning?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SAITO
{DIALOGUE}: You fly out to Sydney on Tuesday.
{DIALOGUE}: We've arranged for you to spend several days...

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks at the photo through the broken glass- a YOUNG BOY holds a PINWHEEL CLEARLY MADE BY A CHILD (each of the points is numbered in pen), his FATHER blows on it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BROWNING
{DIALOGUE}: Must be a cherished memory of his-
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FISCHER
{DIALOGUE}: I put it by his bed.
{DIALOGUE}: He hasn't even noticed.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BROWNING
{DIALOGUE}: Robert, we have to talk about a power of attorney.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: EAMES
{DIALOGUE}: Now, in the dream, I can impersonate Browning and suggest the concepts to Fischer's conscious mind...
{META_DATA}: (draws a diagram)
{DIALOGUE}: Then we take Fischer down another level and his own subconscious feeds it right back to him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{META_DATA}: (impressed)
{DIALOGUE}: So he gives himself the idea.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EAMES
{DIALOGUE}: Precisely.
{DIALOGUE}: That's the only way to make it stick.
{DIALOGUE}: It has to seem self-generated.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: Eames, I'm impressed.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EAMES
{DIALOGUE}: Your condescension, as always, is much appreciated, Arthur.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Why?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: On a 747 the pilots are up above, first class is in the nose so nobody walks through the cabin.
{DIALOGUE}: We'd have to buyout the whole cabin, and the first class flight attendant-
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SAITO
{DIALOGUE}: We bought the airline.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everyone turns to Saito.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SAITO

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. WORKSHOP - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The group is back in the workshop, deep in discussion.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: My question is how we go down three layers with enough stability.
{DIALOGUE}: Three layers down a little turbulence is gonna translate into an earthquake.
{DIALOGUE}: The dreams are gonna collapse with the slightest disturbance.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Yusuf clears his throat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YUSUF
{DIALOGUE}: Sedation.
{DIALOGUE}: For sleep stable enough to create three layers of dreaming...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. MAKESHIFT LAB - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Yusuf depresses a plunger.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Arthur is SLEEPING in a chair.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YUSUF (V.O.)

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Arthur does not stir.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. WORKSHOP - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Arthur unconsciously rubs his cheek.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YUSUF
{DIALOGUE}: The compound we'll be using to share the dream is an advanced Somnacin derivative.
{DIALOGUE}: It creates a very clear connection between dreamers, whilst actually accelerating brain function.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: Buying us more time in each level.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YUSUF
{DIALOGUE}: Brain function in the dream will be about twenty times normal.
{META_DATA}: (MORE)
{DIALOGUE}: 64.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YUSUF (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: And when you go into a dream within that dream the effect is compounded.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: How much time?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YUSUF
{DIALOGUE}: Three dreams... that's ten hours, times twenty, times twenty, times twenty...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EAMES
{DIALOGUE}: Math was never my strong suit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: It's basically a week one layer down, six months two layers down-
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: And ten years in the third level.
{DIALOGUE}: Who wants to spend ten years in a dream?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YUSUF
{DIALOGUE}: Depends on the dream.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EAMES
{DIALOGUE}: It's not going to take us long to crack Fischer open once we get going.
{DIALOGUE}: We'll be out in a couple days, max.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: How do we get out once we've made the plant?
{META_DATA}: (to Cobb)
{DIALOGUE}: I hope you've got something a little more elegant in mind than shooting me in the head like last time.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Arthur tilts back in his chair.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Yusuf turns to Cobb.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: A kick.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Eames slips his foot under Arthur's chair leg.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: TIPS it- Arthur's legs SHOOT UP INSTINCTIVELY for balance-
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EAMES
{DIALOGUE}: That, Ariadne, would be a kick.
{DIALOGUE}: 65.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COBB
{DIALOGUE}: That feeling of falling which snaps you awake.
{DIALOGUE}: We use that to jolt ourselves awake once we're done.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: But how are we going to feel that through the sedation?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: YUSUF
{DIALOGUE}: That's the clever part.
{DIALOGUE}: I customize the sedative...

{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARIADNE
{DIALOGUE}: How will you know?
{DIALOGUE}: 108.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARTHUR
{DIALOGUE}: His music warns me it's coming, then the van hitting the barrier of the bridge should be unmistakable- that's when I blow the floor out from underneath us and we get a nice synchronized kick.
{DIALOGUE}: Too soon, and we won't get pulled out; too late and I won't be able to drop us.
