{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 2 EXT. CITY RUINS - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Same spot as the last shot, but now it is a landscape in Hell.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The cars are stopped in rusted rows, still bumper to bumper.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The skyline of buildings beyond has been shattered by some unimaginable force like a row of kicked-down sandcastles.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wind blows through the desolation, keening with the sound of ten million dead souls.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It scurries the ashes into drifts, stark white in the moonlight against the charred rubble.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A TITLE CARD FADES IN:
{META_DATA}: LOS ANGELES, July 11, 2029

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The rush hour crowd burned down in their tracks.
{META_DATA}: 4 WE DISSOLVE TO a playground... where intense heat has half-melted the
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: jungle gym, the blast has warped the swing set, the merry-go-round has sagged in the firestorm.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Small skulls look accusingly from the ash-drifts.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WE HEAR the distant echo of children's voices... playing and laughing in the sun.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A silly, sing-songy rhyme as WE TRACKS SLOWLY over seared asphalt where the faint hieroglyphs of hopscotch lines are still visible.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CAMERA comes to rest on a burnt and rusted tricycle... next to the tiny skull of its owner.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A metal foot crushes the skull like china.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: TILT UP, revealing a humanoid machine holding a massive battle rifle.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Its glowing red eyes compassionlessly sweep the dead terrain, hunting.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The SOUNDS of ROARING TURBINES.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Searchlights blaze down as a formation of flying HK (Hunter-Killer) patrol machines passes overhead.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SLOW, BOILING, ENORMOUS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: FILLING FRAME.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VOICE (SARAH CONNOR)
{DIALOGUE}: Skynet, the computer which controlled the machines, sent two terminators back through time.
{DIALOGUE}: Their mission: to destroy the leader of the human Resistance... John Connor.
{DIALOGUE}: My son.
{DIALOGUE}: The first terminator was programmed to strike at me, in the year 1984... before John was born.
{DIALOGUE}: It failed.
{DIALOGUE}: The second was set to strike at John himself, when he was still a child.
{DIALOGUE}: As before, the Resistance was able to send a lone warrior.
{DIALOGUE}: A protector for John.
{DIALOGUE}: It was just a question of which one of them would reach him first...
{META_DATA}: DISSOLVE TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 7 EXT. TRUCKSTOP - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wild fingers of BLUE-WHITE ELECTRIC ARCS dance in a steel canyon formed by two TRACTOR TRAILERS, parked side by side in the back lot of an all-night truck stop.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The strange lightning forms a circular opening in mid-air, and in the sudden flare of light we see a FIGURE in a SPHERE OF ENERGY.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then the FRAME WHITES OUT with an explosive THUNDERCLAP!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Through the clearing vapor we see the figure clearly... a naked man.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: TERMINATOR has come through.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Physique: massive, perfect.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Face: devoid of emotion.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator stands and impassively surveys its surroundings.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 8 INT. TRUCK STOP DINER - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On a back route to north L.A.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A handful of local TRUCKERS hunch over chili-sizes, CAT hats pushed back on their heads.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Three BIKERS are playing a game of pool in the back, their Miller empties lining the table's rail.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The dive's owner, LLOYD, a fat, aging biker-type in a soiled apron, stands behind the bar.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Nothing much going on...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then the front door opens and a big naked guy strolls in -- that doesn't happen every night.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All eyes simultaneously swivel toward Terminator.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Its emotionless gaze passes over the customers as it walks calmly through the room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everyone frozen, not sure how to react.
{META_DATA}: 8A TERMINATOR POV. A digitized electronic scan of the room, overlaid
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: with alphanumeric readouts which change faster than the human eye can follow.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In POV we move past the staring truckers, past the owner and the awestruck WAITRESS, and approach a large nasty-looking biker puffing on a cigar.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His body is outlined, or "selected", and thousands of estimated measurements appear.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His clothing has been analyzed and deemed suitable...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: 8B TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: I need your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The big biker's eyes narrow.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes a long draw on this cigar, the tip cherry-red hot.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CIGAR BIKER
{DIALOGUE}: You forgot to say please.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He grinds the cigar out on Terminator's chest.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Which produces not the slight reaction of pain.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator calmly, and without expression, grabs Cigar by his meaty upper arm... Cigar screams from the hydraulic grip.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator doesn't see Cigar's friend, behind him, holding his pool cue by the narrow end like a Louisville Slugger.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The heavy send whistles in a powerful swing and CRACKS IN TWO across the back of Terminator's head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator seems not to notice.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Doesn't even blink.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Without releasing his grip on Cigar, he snaps his arm straight back and grabs Pool Cue by the front of his jacket.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly the heavyset biker finds himself flying through the nearest window.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CRAASSH!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator hurls Cigar, all 230 pounds of him, clear over the bar, through the serving window into the kitchen, where he lands on the big flat GRILL.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We hear a SOUND like SIZZLING BACON as Cigar screams, flopping jerking.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He rolls off in a smoking heap.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The third biker whips out a knife with a eight-inch blade and slashes at Terminator's face.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator grabs the arcing blade with his bare hand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Holding it by the razor-sharp blade he jerks is from the guy's hand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ultra-fast here: He flips it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Grabs the handle like you're supposed to hold a knife.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Grabs the biker and slams him face-down over the bar.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then brings the knife whistling down, pinning the biker's shoulder to the bar top with his own steel.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 9 INT. KITCHEN
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The doors BANGS OPEN and Terminator strides in.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Mexican cook does a fast fade as Terminator walks toward Cigar, who is cursing in pain on the floor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With his deep-fried fingers he struggles to get out the .45 auto tucked under his leather jacket.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But he can't even hold onto it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator takes it from him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Instead of pointing it at him, Terminator carefully examines weapon, analyzing its caliber and operating condition.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator never threatens... that's a human thing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He just takes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cigar senses what he must do when the emotionless eyes come back to him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He slides the keys to his bike across the floor to Terminator's foot.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then painfully starts getting out of his jacket.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 10 INT. TRUCK STOP
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator strides from the kitchen, fully clothed now in a black leather jacket, leather riding pants, and heavy, clean boots.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He moves toward the moaning biker pinned to the pool table.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Without slowing his stride he jerks the knife out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The guy slumps to the floor, groaning, behind him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator continues toward the front of the diner, passing Lloyd, the owner.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At the door, he comes abreast of two truckers who sit frozen like a snapshot in mid-bite.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: One of the truckers finally nods.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TRUCKER
{DIALOGUE}: Evening...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator impassively stares back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then moves on out the door.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 11 EXT. TRUCK STOP

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sticks the .45 in his belt and swings one leg over a massive CUSTOM ELECTRO-GLIDE.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He slips the dagger in his boot and the key in the ignition.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kicks over the engine.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It catches with a roar and he slams the heavy iron into gear with a KLUNK.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lloyd appears at the diner's door with a sawed-off 10-GAUGE WINCHESTER LEVER-ACTION SHOTGUN.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He fires into the air and jacks around round in fast, aiming at Terminator's back.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LLOYD
{DIALOGUE}: I can't let you take the man's wheels, son.
{DIALOGUE}: Now get off or I'll put you down.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator turns and considers by coldly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He eases the shifter up into neutral.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Rocks the bike onto its kickstand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Swings him leg over and walks calmly toward the guy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator strides right up to Lloyd, staring straight into the shotgun's muzzle.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lloyd starts sweating, trying to decide is he's going to kill a man in cold blood.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's still trying to decide when Terminator's hand blurs out like a striking cobra and is somehow suddenly holding the shotgun.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lloyd gapes, knowing he's screwed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then... Terminator reaches toward him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Oh shit... And slips the sunglasses out of Lloyd's shirt pocket.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Puts them on.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Strides back to the Harley and roars off in a shower of gravel.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 12 EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator roars down the freeway, heading for L.A. Cold neon flares across the chrome of the big bike.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He draws his revolver and cautiously moves into the shadows between the rows of pillars.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A NAKED MAN glides from a shadowed doorway behind the cop.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Nothing special about him.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Yes, that photo.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TIM
{DIALOGUE}: So she's pretty cool, huh?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: pulls the trigger so fast it almost seems like a machine-pistol.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ON TERMINATOR'S BACK, as the 9mm slugs slam into it, punching bloody holes in the motorcycle jacket.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: JOHN is bug-eyed with fear, but completely unscratched.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator's body has blocked the bullets.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Beretta CLACKS empty.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator turns at the sound.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shoves John behind a Coke machine.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Drops the empty shotgun.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Starts walking toward the "cop".
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The empty magazine clatters to the floor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The cop inserts another one.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Snaps back the slide.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator still has twenty feet to go.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He doesn't break his purposeful stride.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The cop opens fire.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bullets rake Terminator's chest.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He doesn't even flinch.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ten feet to go.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Neither the cop nor Terminator show the slightest change in expression as the gun rips Terminator's wardrobe to shreds.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLACK.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The pistol empties again.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator stops two feet in front of the cop.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The appraise each other for a second.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We realize now that the cop is a terminator too.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We don't know the details yet, but let's call him the T-1000 (since that's what he is).
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A newer model than the one we've come to know so well (the 800 Series "Arnold").
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This guy's a prototype... and he's got quite a few surprises.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: T-1000 AND TERMINATOR size each other up.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator moves first.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He grabs T-1000 in his massive hands but the T-1000 snaps back with a counter-grip.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After about two seconds of intense slamming, the walls on both sides of the corridor have all the plaster smashed in, and the two battling machines have blasted through the wall and disappeared.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: JOHN, totally stunned by all this, remembers to move.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He staggers to his feet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Stumble-runs toward the parking garage.
{META_DATA}: 44C THIRD LEVEL CONCOURSE. A plate glass window EXPLODES and Terminator
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: crashes through to the tile floor like a sack of cement amid the screaming crowd.
{META_DATA}: 44D T-1000 turns without a word and heads back through the store after
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John, accelerating slowly into a loping, predatory run.
{META_DATA}: 44E Terminator is totally still. A JAPANESE TOURIST cautiously steps
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: forward and takes a picture of the body.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, Terminator's eyes snap open.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The stunned tourist backs away.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He sits up and looks around.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gets his bearings.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Rises smoothly to his feet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All servos seem to be working fine.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The tourist's camera whirs as the motor-drive runs on by itself, taking shot after show.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The owner isn't even looking through the eyepiece, he's so shocked.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 45 INT. PARKING GARAGE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John is frantically pumping the kick-start of his bike, scared shitless and the damned thing won't start.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His hands are shaking so badly he can't find the choke.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks up to see -- The T-1000 running down the corridor toward him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John fumbles with the choke.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The bike catches.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He slams it in gear and spins the bike out into the main aisle of the garage.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John looks back... the T-1000 is behind him, running.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He twists the throttle and guns the little bike forward.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Incredibly, the T-1000 is gaining.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This nightmare isn't happening.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John races out the exit ramp, and charges right into the street.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 46 EXT. STREET
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John shoots into the busy traffic.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cuts off a BIG-RIG TOW TRUCK.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The DRIVER swears.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hits his air horn.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: What the driver doesn't see is the cop, running faster than O.J. Simpson at the airport, who emerges onto the street and runs back at his truck.
{META_DATA}: 46A IN THE TRUCK. The driver hears a thump as something slams against his
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: door, then feels himself pulled right out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: T-1000 slides in and takes his place.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The truck is still rolling along about 25 mph.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: T-1000 accelerates after John without missing a beat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It can see him, up ahead, weaving through traffic.
{META_DATA}: 46B Out of the garage entrance, Terminator roars onto the street on the
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Harley.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He accelerates after the others.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 47 EXT. FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John slides his bike down the service ramp faster than he's ever done it before.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He races along the bottom of the canal, turning into a narrower tributary which has vertical sides.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: No sign of pursuit.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 47A Suddenly he sees the sun blocked out by a great shadow.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Kenworth tow-truck... big as a house, all chrome and roaring diesel engine... crashes through the fence and launches itself right into the center of the canal.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It crashes down, 15 feet to the ground, going about 60, hits at an angle and tears into the concrete wall with a hideous grinding of metal.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It ricochets back and forth between the walls then, bellowing like a gunshot stegosaurus, it just keep on plowing forward, gathering speed.
{META_DATA}: 47B John looks back and sees this wall of metal almost filling the narrow
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: concrete canal and he milks every last bit of throttle the little bike has.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Kenworth is all muscle, tearing along the canal like a train in a tunnel.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Its big tires send up huge sheets of muddy spray, backlit in the setting sun.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It looks like some kind of demon.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And... it's gaining.
{META_DATA}: 47C ABOVE THEM, on the service road running parallel, Terminator is
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: fighting to overtake them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks down and sees John with the tow- truck from Hell catching up to him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is only about twenty feet behind him and still gaining.
{META_DATA}: 47D ANGLE IN THE CANAL, looking back past a desperate John, at the wall
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: of metal filling frame behind him.
{META_DATA}: 47E ABOVE, Terminator cuts the bike suddenly hard to the left, leaving the
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: road.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hitting an earth embankment just right, he jumps the bike into the air like Steve McQueen in "The Great Escape" and vaults the fence bordering the canal.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It slams down at the edge of the canal and tears along, inches from the drop-off on a dirt path, accelerating past the truck in the canal below.
{META_DATA}: 47F John hits some water and slews momentarily, loosing speed. The
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: massive push-plate on the front of the truck slams into his back fender.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Panicked, he pulls a little ahead.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All this is happening at about sixty miles and hour.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Top speed for the little dirt bike.
{META_DATA}: 47G SLOW MOTION as Terminator jumps the bike again. This time the 700-
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: pound Harley sails out into space and drops into the canal.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It arcs down between the truck and John, hitting on its wheels.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It bottoms out, an explosion of sparks under the frame.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Only the ultra-fast reflexes of a machine could keep the bike upright.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator fights for control.
{META_DATA}: 47H He guns the throttle and the powerful bike roars up beside John's tiny
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Honda.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator sweeps the kid off his machine with one arm and swings him onto the Harley, in front of him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John's Honda weaves and falls, smashing instantly under thundering tires.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Harley roars ahead.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It hits eighty.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ahead is an overpass, and supporting it is an abutment which bisects the canal into two channels.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Harley thunders into one channel, which is essentially a short tunnel.
{META_DATA}: 47I The truck can't fit on either side. Neither can it stop, at that
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: speed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Tires locked, it slides on the muddy concrete and piles into the concrete abutment at seventy.
{META_DATA}: 47J Terminator and John emerge from the tunnel, looking back to see a
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: fireball blasting through behind them as the truck's side-tanks explode.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator stops the Harley.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John peers around his body to see the destruction.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A burning wheel wobbles out of the tunnel and flops in the mud.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator revs the bike and they roar away, down the canal, disappearing around a bend.
{META_DATA}: 47K ANGLE ON THE FIRE, as a column of black smoke rises from the overpass.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Smoke boils from the tunnel as well, and inside it is a solid wall of flame.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A figure appears in the fire.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just an outline.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Walking slowly... calmly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The figure emerges from the flames.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is human-shaped but far from human.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A smooth chrome man.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Not a servo-mechanism like Terminator is underneath, with its complex hydraulics and cables... this thing is a featureless, liquid chrome surface, bending seamlessly at knees and elbows as it walks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It reminds us of mercury.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A mercury man.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Its face is simple, unformed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Unruffled by thousand-degree heat, it walks toward us.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With each step detail returns.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: First the shape and lines of its clothing emerge from the liquid chrome surface, then finer details... buttons, facial features, ears...
{META_DATA}: 47K But it's still al chrome. With its last step, the color returns to
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: everything.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is the cop again... handsome young face, blond hair, mustache.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Icy eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It stops and looks around.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is a perfect chameleon.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A liquid metal robot.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A killing machine with the ultimate skills of mimicry for infiltration of human society.
{META_DATA}: 47L ANGLE NEARBY, as several police cruisers and a fire truck pull up.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: T-1000 climbs out of the canal behind them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: More cops arrive.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: T-1000 blends in perfectly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There are always cops at diasters and scenes of violence.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We now see why its choice of protective mimicry is so perfect.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It walks among the other cops unnoticed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gets into one of the squad cars.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Starts it and drives away.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 48 EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator, with John in front of him on the Harley, roars down the empty street.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John cranes his neck around to get a look at the person/thing he is riding with.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The image is strangely reminiscent of father/son, out for an evening ride.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John is still in shock from the experience of what just happened and he's just a ten-year kid, but he's also John Connor who will someday rise to greatness, and we see a bit of that in him even know.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Whoa... time out.
{DIALOGUE}: Stop the bike!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator immediately complies.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He leans the bike into a turn.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They head into a nearby alley.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 49 EXT. ALLEY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator and John rolls into the alley and come to a stop.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John slides off the gas tank.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator impassively stares at him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John checks him out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Tentatively speaks.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{DIALOGUE}: Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: No way!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John touches Terminator's skin.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then the blood on his jacket.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His mind overloads as the reality of it hits him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Holy shit... you're really real!
{DIALOGUE}: I mean... whoah!
{META_DATA}: (stepping back)
{DIALOGUE}: You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: I'm a cybernetic organism.
{DIALOGUE}: Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: This in intense.
{DIALOGUE}: Get a grip, John.
{DIALOGUE}: Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.
{DIALOGUE}: So what's the deal?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: My mission is to protect you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah?
{DIALOGUE}: Who sent you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: You did.
{DIALOGUE}: Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John gives him an amazed look.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: This is deep.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 50 EXT. STREET - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John and Terminator on the bike again, weaving through the side streets.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They blend into the evening traffic.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In the darkness, Terminator's wounds are not readily visible.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John cranes his head up and back.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: So this other guy?
{DIALOGUE}: He's a terminator too, right, like you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: Not like me.
{DIALOGUE}: A T-1000.
{DIALOGUE}: Advanced prototype.
{DIALOGUE}: A mimetic polyalloy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: What does that mean?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: Liquid metal.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Radical.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: You are targeted for termination.
{DIALOGUE}: The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission.
{DIALOGUE}: Ever.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John mulls that over.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Where we going?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: We have to leave the city, immediately.
{DIALOGUE}: And avoid the authorities.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Can I stop by my house?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: Negative.
{DIALOGUE}: The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: You sure?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: I would.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 51 EXT. PAYPHONE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John is quickly going through his pockets for change.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He has plenty of bills but no quarters.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks but I gotta warn them.
{DIALOGUE}: Shit!
{DIALOGUE}: You got a quarter?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator reaches past John and smashes the cover plate off the phone's cash box with the heel of his hand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A shower of change tumbles out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator hands one to John.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John dials.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 52 INT. VOIGHT HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Janelle Voight picks up the kitchen phone and cradles it with her shoulder which she continues to chop vegetables with a large knife.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She answers sweetly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JANELLE
{DIALOGUE}: Hello?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{META_DATA}: (filtered through phone)
{DIALOGUE}: Janelle?
{DIALOGUE}: It's me.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In the backyard, John's German Shepherd is going bonkers, barking at something.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JANELLE
{DIALOGUE}: John?
{DIALOGUE}: Where are you, honey?
{DIALOGUE}: It's late.
{DIALOGUE}: You should come home, dear.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm making a casserole.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: AT THE PAYPHONE.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John listens, an odd look on his face.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He covers the phone's mouthpiece and turns to Terminator.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{META_DATA}: (whispering)
{DIALOGUE}: Something's wrong.
{DIALOGUE}: She's never this nice.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: IN THE VOIGHTS' KITCHEN.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Todd comes through the kitchen's back door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just home from work.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He ignores Janelle and opens the fridge.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Grabs a carton of milk.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Takes a sip.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Frowns at the dog's barking.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TODD
{DIALOGUE}: What the hell's the goddamn dog barking at?
{DIALOGUE}: SHUT UP, YOU MUTT!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: TIGHT ON JANELLE as Todd growls around the kitchen behind her.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He passes OUT OF FRAME next to her.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Janelle switches the phone to her other hand then... THUNK!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her free hand seems to do something out of frame.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is a gurgling, and the sound of liquid dribbling onto the floor.
{META_DATA}: (Don't go away.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We'll find out what happened in a moment)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: AT THE PAYPHONE
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: The dog's really barking.
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe it's already there.
{DIALOGUE}: What should I do?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator takes the phone from John's hand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Janelle's voice is floating through the receiver.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JANELLE
{META_DATA}: (filtered)
{DIALOGUE}: John?
{DIALOGUE}: John, are you okay?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator speaks into the phone in a perfect imitation of John's voice...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{META_DATA}: (in John's voice)
{DIALOGUE}: I'm right here.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm fine.
{META_DATA}: (to John, a whisper)
{DIALOGUE}: What's the dog's name?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Max.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator nods.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Speaks into the phone.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: Hey, Janelle, what's wrong with Wolfy?
{DIALOGUE}: I can hear him barking.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Turns to John.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: Your foster parents are dead.
{DIALOGUE}: Let's go.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator heads for the bike.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John, shocked, stares after him.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 53 INT. VOIGHT HOUSE/KITCHEN
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Janelle hangs up the phone.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her expression is neutral.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Calm.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: PAN OVER along her arm, which is stretched out straight from the shoulder.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Partway along its length her arm has turned smoothly into something else... a metal cylinder which tapers into a sword-like spike.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now we see Todd Voight PINNED TO A KITCHEN CABINET by the spike which has punched through his milk carton, through his mouth and exits the back of his head into the cabinet door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His eyes are glassy and lifeless.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The spike is withdrawn -- SWIISHHTT!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -- so rapidly, Todd is actually standing there a second before he slumps out of sight.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THUMP.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 53A Janelle doesn't bat an eye as the spike smoothly changes shape and color, transforming back into a hand, and then...
{META_DATA}: 53B JANELLE CHANGES rapidly into the COP we now know as the T-1000. The
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: change has liquid quality.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: T-1000 opens the back door.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 54 EXT. VOIGHT HOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: T-1000 approaches the big German Shepherd, which slinks away from it, barking in fear.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: T-1000 walk right into CLOSE UP.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Reaches down, OUT OF FRAME.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We hear that sickening THUNK followed by a shrill YELP.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then T-1000's hand snaps up INTO FRAME holding a bloody dog collar.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The tag reads "MAX".
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: T-1000 nods thoughtfully.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Heads back to the house.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 55 EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dark.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Off a quiet street.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator stands near the Harley, watching John pace before him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John's brain is calling time-out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is all too weird.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: I need a minute here, okay?
{DIALOGUE}: You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: Anything it samples by physical contact.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John thinks about that, trying to grasp their opponent's parameters.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: Only an object of equal size.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John's still reeling from meeting one terminator, which now seems downright conventional next to the exotic new model.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: It can't form complex machines.
{DIALOGUE}: Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.
{DIALOGUE}: It doesn't work that way.
{DIALOGUE}: But it can form solid metal shapes.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 56 INT. VOIGHT HOUSE - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: T-1000 walks down the dark hall.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It passes the bathroom and we see the real Janelle's legs through the half-open door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The shower is running.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her blood mixes with water on the white tile floor.
{META_DATA}: 56A In John's bedroom the T-1000 begins searching methodically in the
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: dark.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Calmly and dispassionately ripping the room apart for any clues that could lead it to its target.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: T-1000 finds a box of audio cassettes marked "Messages from Mom".
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In it are some letters, and envelopes filled with snapshots.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It begins looking through some of the photos...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SHOT OF JOHN AND SARAH during the missing years.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sarah in olive cammos with an RPG 7 grenade launcher, teaching John how to aim.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sarah with a group of military-clad Guatemalan men, standing next to cases of Stinger missiles.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John and Sarah in a Contra camp, deep in the mountains.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 57 EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John is now sitting on the curb, lost in stunned thought.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator stands above him, watching the street like a Doberman.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He glances down at John.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that.
{DIALOGUE}: For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.
{DIALOGUE}: Then there were some other guys.
{DIALOGUE}: She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.
{DIALOGUE}: So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.
{DIALOGUE}: Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.
{DIALOGUE}: Didn't you know?
{DIALOGUE}: It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right?
{DIALOGUE}: I hated her for that.
{META_DATA}: (he looks up)
{DIALOGUE}: But everything she said was true.
{META_DATA}: (he stands)
{DIALOGUE}: We gotta get her out of there.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: Negative.
{DIALOGUE}: The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, great.
{DIALOGUE}: And what happens to her?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator's reply is matter-of-fact.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: TERMINATED!?
{DIALOGUE}: Shit!
{DIALOGUE}: Why didn't you tell me?
{DIALOGUE}: We gotta right now!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: Negative.
{DIALOGUE}: She is not a mission priority.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John strides away.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator goes after him and grabs him arm.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John struggles against the grip.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Which doesn't do him much good.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Hey, goddammit!
{DIALOGUE}: What's your problem?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Starts dragging John back to the bike.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John spots a couple of collage-age slab-o-meat JOCK-TYPES across the street and starts yelling to them.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Help!
{DIALOGUE}: HELP!!
{DIALOGUE}: I'm being kidnapped!
{DIALOGUE}: Get this psycho off of me!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The TWO JOCKS start toward him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John yells in outrage to Terminator.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Let go of me!!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: To his surprise, Terminator's hand opens so fast John falls right on his butt.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks up at the open hand.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Oww!
{DIALOGUE}: Why'd you do that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: You told me to.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John stares at him in amazement as he realizes...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: You have to do what I say?!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: That is one of my mission parameters.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Prove it... stand on one foot.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator expressionlessly lifts one leg.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John grins.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's the first on his block...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Cool!
{DIALOGUE}: My own terminator.
{DIALOGUE}: This is great!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The two guys get there and look at Terminator standing there calmly with one leg up in the air.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This big guy in black leather and dark glasses, standing like a statue.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FIRST JOCK
{DIALOGUE}: Hey, kid.
{DIALOGUE}: You okay?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John turns to him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: No longer needing to be rescued.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Take a hike, bozo.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FIRST JOCK
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah?
{DIALOGUE}: Fuck you, you little dipshit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Dipshit?
{DIALOGUE}: Did you say dipshit?!
{META_DATA}: (to Terminator)
{DIALOGUE}: Grab this guy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator complies instantly, hoisting him one-handed by the collar.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: the guy's legs are pinwheeling.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Now who's the dipshit, you jock douchebag?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Immediately, things get out of hand.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He can't provoke a reaction.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Even here, strapped down, the two of them alone, she give him no superiority.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He notices something strange among the buckets and cleaning supplies.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A mop lies on the floor, with its handle snapped off about halfway up.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Douglas ponders this for half a second, then hears a SOUND behind him and spins around.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The sound he heard was Sarah's cell door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The missing two feet of MOP HANDLE fill his vision as it CRACKS viciously across the bridge of his nose.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 250 pounds of doughy attendant hit the floor like a sack of cement.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: T-1000's mass has been spread out a quarter of an inch thick over several square yards of floor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The guard walked over the T-1000, and his structure was sampled that instant.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now we see it drawing in and pulling up to form the figure of the guard.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The T-1000/Guard's feet are the last to form, the last of the "liquid floor" pulling in to form shiny black guard shoes.

{META_DATA}: 66E The real guard spins at the sound of footsteps to see... himself.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He has one deeply disturbing moment to consider the ramifications of that.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he sees his double calmly raise its hand and, inexplicably, points his right index finger directly at the real guard's face, about a foot away.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In a split second, the finger spears out, elongating into a thin steel rod which snaps out like a stiletto, slamming into the guard's eye.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It punches into the corner of the eye, past the eyeball like a trans- orbital lobotomy tool, and emerges from the back of the guard's skull.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Life quietly empties from the guard's face.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is dead weight, hanging from the rod/finger with suddenly reacts -- SSSNICK.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the guard slumps, the T-1000 takes his weight easily with one hand and walks him, like it's carrying a suit on a hanger, back toward the night desk.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The wounds are so tiny, no blood drips onto the floor.
{META_DATA}: 66F ON THE NIGHT NURSE, glancing up as the T-1000/Guard walks past,

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It withdraws its hand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The chest is once again a surface that looks like cloth, buttons, name-tag etc.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: You'd ever guess it was really an intelligent liquid metal.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In slowed-down dream-time, Sarah scrambles back along the floor like a crab, spinning and clawing her way to her feet along the wall.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She runs like the wind, like in her nightmare.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As it squeezes itself through like metal playdough, its surface reforms perfectly on our side.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see it deform and squeeze through like a viscous paste forced past an obstacle.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Silberman has recovered enough to be sitting up and watching this.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: That faint snapping sound is his mind.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is a CLANK and we see that the guard's gun has caught against the bars... the only solid object.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The T-1000 turns its wrist and tries again, slipping the gun endwise through the gap.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Are you ever afraid?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator pauses for a second.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The thought never occurred to him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He searches him mind for the answer...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator slings the M-79 and starts looking for the grenades.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Not even of dying?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.
{DIALOGUE}: Then it doesn't matter.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John is idly spinning a Sig Saur 9mm pistol on his finger... backwards and forwards like Bat Masteron.

{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: A107 EXT. COMPOUND - DAY/LATER

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sarah is field- stripping and cleaning guns, very methodical.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is no wasted motion.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Not far away, John and Terminator are working on the Bronco.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They're greasy up to their elbows, lying on their backs under the engine compartment, ratcheting bolts into places on the new water pump.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: There was this one guy that was kinda cool.
{DIALOGUE}: He taught me engines.
{DIALOGUE}: Hold this a second.
{DIALOGUE}: Mom screwed it up, of course.
{DIALOGUE}: Sooner or later she'd always tell them about Judgment Day and me being this world leader and that's be all she wrote.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John thinks he's being causal, but his longing for some kind of parental connection is obvious.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: Torque wrench please.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN

{DIALOGUE}: I wish I coulda met my real dad.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: You will.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah.
{DIALOGUE}: I guess so.
{DIALOGUE}: My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.
{DIALOGUE}: But right now he hasn't even been born yet.
{DIALOGUE}: Man, is messes with your head.
{DIALOGUE}: Where's that other bolt?
{META_DATA}: (Terminator hands it to him)
{DIALOGUE}: Thanks.
{DIALOGUE}: Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.
{DIALOGUE}: I see her crying sometimes.
{DIALOGUE}: She denies it totally, of course.
{DIALOGUE}: Like she says she got something in her eye.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They crawl out from under the truck into the bright sunlight.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: Why do you cry?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: You mean people?
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{DIALOGUE}: We just cry.
{DIALOGUE}: You know.
{DIALOGUE}: When it hurts.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: Pain causes it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOHN
{DIALOGUE}: Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.
{DIALOGUE}: You get it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TERMINATOR
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator gets into the Bronco and turns the ignition key and the engine catches with a roar.

{META_DATA}: A108 SARAH, across the compound, pauses in her work to watch John and
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Terminator.
{META_DATA}: A109 SARAH'S POV... we don't hear what John and Terminator are saying. It
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: is a soundless pantomime as John is trying to show some other gestures to the cyborg.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Trying to get him to walk more casually.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: John walks, then Terminator tries it, then John gestures wildly, talking very fast... explaining the fundamental principles of cool.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They try it again.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Continued ad lib as we hear:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SARAH (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Watching John with the machine, it was suddenly so clear.
{DIALOGUE}: The Terminator would never stop, it would never leave him... it would always be there.
{DIALOGUE}: And it would never hurt him, never shout at him or get drunk and hit him, or say it couldn't spend time with him because it was too busy.
{DIALOGUE}: And it would die to protect him.
{DIALOGUE}: Of all the would-be fathers who came and went over the years, this thing, this machine, was the only one who measured up.
{DIALOGUE}: In an insane world, it was the sanest choice.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sarah clenches her jaw and goes grimly back to work... a strong woman made hard and cold by years of hard choices.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see the postmark: "Charon Mesa, Calif."
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: TIGHT ON T-1000 staring at the postmark on the envelope.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Less than fifteen minutes have gone by.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bathed in sweat, Sarah sits hunched over the table.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Every muscle is shaking.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She is gasping.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sarah struggles to breathe, running her hand through her hair which is soaked with sweat, She can escape from the hospital, but she can't escape from the madness which haunts her.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She looks down at the words she has carved on the table, amid the scrawled hearts and bird-droppings.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are: "NO FATE."
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Something changes in her eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She slams her knife down in the table top, embedding it deeply in the words.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then gets up suddenly and we --

{DIALOGUE}: I don't care.
{DIALOGUE}: We've gotta stop her.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It rips the hand from the railing with difficulty.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's starting to "glitch".

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The pile-driver blow buries Terminator's fist almost to the elbow.
{META_DATA}: 204F But the T-1000's head morphs in a split-second into a hand which grips
