{CHARACTER_NAME}: ALVY
{DIALOGUE}: There's an old joke.
{DIALOGUE}: Uh, two elderly women are at a Catskills mountain resort, and one of 'em says: "Boy, the food at this place is really terrible."
{DIALOGUE}: The other one says, "Yeah, I know, and such ... small portions."
{DIALOGUE}: Well, that's essentially how I feel about life.
{DIALOGUE}: Full of loneliness and misery and suffering and unhappiness, and it's all over much too quickly.
{DIALOGUE}: The-the other important joke for me is one that's, uh, usually attributed to Groucho Marx, but I think it appears originally in Freud's wit and its relation to the unconscious.
{DIALOGUE}: And it goes like this-I'm paraphrasing: Uh ... "I would never wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member."
{DIALOGUE}: That's the key joke of my adult life in terms of my relationships with women.
{DIALOGUE}: Tsch, you know, lately the strangest things have been going through my mind, 'cause I turned forty, tsch, and I guess I'm going through a life crisis or something, I don't know.
{DIALOGUE}: I, uh ... and I'm not worried about aging.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not one o' those characters, you know.
{DIALOGUE}: Although I'm balding slightly on top, that's about the worst you can say about me.
{DIALOGUE}: I, uh, I think I'm gonna get better as I get older, you know?
{DIALOGUE}: I think I'm gonna be the- the balding virile type, you know, as opposed to say the, uh, distinguished gray, for instance, you know?
{DIALOGUE}: 'Less I'm neither o' those two.
{DIALOGUE}: Unless I'm one o' those guys with saliva dribbling out of his mouth who wanders into a cafeteria with a shopping bag screaming about socialism.
{META_DATA}: (Sighing)
{DIALOGUE}: Annie and I broke up and I-I still can't get my mind around that.
{DIALOGUE}: You know, I-I keep sifting the pieces of the relationship through my mind and-and examining my life and tryin' to figure out where did the screw-up come, you know, and a year ago we were... tsch, in love.
{DIALOGUE}: You know, and-and-and ... And it's funny, I'm not-I'm not a morose type.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not a depressive character.
{DIALOGUE}: I-I-I, uh,
{META_DATA}: (Laughing)
{DIALOGUE}: you know, I was a reasonably happy kid, I guess.
