{META_DATA}: FADE IN:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 1 INT. TOWNHOUSE/STUDY - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -EARLY APRIL, 1841- We are close on a PAIR OF BLACK HANDS as they open A
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: FINELY WRAPPED PACKET OF VIOLIN STRINGS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WE CUT TO the hands stringing a VIOLIN.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's not a high end piece, but it is quite nice.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WE CUT TO a wide shot of the study.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sitting in a chair with violin in hand is SOLOMON NORTHUP; a man in his late twenties.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everything about Solomon, his mien and manner, is distinguished.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But he, too, seems a hardy individual.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Someone who has known manual labor in his time.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon begins to lightly play his violin, as if testing the strings, their tuning.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Satisfied, Solomon begins to play vigorously.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he does, we make a HARD CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - EVENING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We come in on a lively affair.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A dinner party is being thrown within the confines of a fairly stately house.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In attendance are EIGHT COUPLES.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All are WHITE and all are FAIRLY YOUNG, in their early twenties.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The men and women are dressed in very fine attire.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We should get the sense that for the most part they are people of means.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The furniture has been set aside in the living room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a REEL.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The music they are dancing to is being played by Solomon, having cut directly from the tune he was previously playing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He plays with a light determination, and in no way seems possessed with empty servitude.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon concludes the reel, and the dancers break into enthusiastic applause, which is followed by personal thanks and congratulations from all.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It should be clear that despite their respective races there is much admiration and appreciation for Solomon's abilities.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/BEDROOM - MORNING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is a Saturday morning.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clad in her finest attire is ANNE; Solomon's wife, a few years younger than he.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see also the Northup children: MARGARET who is eight, and ALONZO who is five.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are handsome, and well groomed kids.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Anne straightens up the children.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She finishes,
{META_DATA}: (CONTINUED)
{META_DATA}: 2.
{META_DATA}: 3 CONTINUED:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: she rises up and stands behind them, almost as if preparing to pose for a portrait.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They all wait a moment, then Solomon enters the foyer.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stands and looks admiringly at his family.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ADMIRINGLY stressed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It isn't that he doesn't have love for them, he does as well.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But in the moment, he truly admires his greatest accomplishment: a family that is healthy and well and provided for.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He goes to his children, and hands each a coin, then goes to Anne.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gives her a kiss on the cheek.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The children giggle at the sight.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. STREET - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon and his family are out walking along the streets and groves of Saratoga.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The streets are well populated this morning with many people out strolling.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Most are WHITE, but there are BLACKS as well.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are FREED BLACKS who mingle fairly easily - though not always completely - with the whites.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see, too, a few BLACK SLAVES who travel with their WHITE MASTERS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: These pairings are largely from the south and - despite the fact the blacks are slaves - they are not physically downtrodden, not field hands.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are well dressed and "leading apparently an easy life" - comparatively speaking - as they trail their masters.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As they walk, Solomon and his family arrive to an intersection well-worn and muddied from horse and cart traffic.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon and his children easily jump across the muck.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Anne stands at the lip of the puddle, calls for Solomon to help her across.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ANNE
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon... Solomon, turning back to his wife with a broad smile waving her forward:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: Come, Anne.
{DIALOGUE}: Jump.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The children, now smiling as well, egg their mother on.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ALONZO MARGARET
{DIALOGUE}: Jump.
{DIALOGUE}: You can make it.
{DIALOGUE}: I've done it.
{DIALOGUE}: You can make it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ANNE
{DIALOGUE}: I will not ruin my dress.
{DIALOGUE}: Catch me!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon moves close, holds out his arms.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Yet, there's still just a bit of mischievousness in his eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Anne gives her husband a lightly stern look to which Solomon replies.
{META_DATA}: (CONTINUED)
{META_DATA}: 3.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: I will catch you, Anne.
{META_DATA}: (BEAT)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: I will.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Again, lightly stern:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ANNE
{DIALOGUE}: You will.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And with that Anne takes the leap.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon catches her, swings her around grandly and sets her down lightly to the delighted applause of the children.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: That done, Solomon takes Anne's hand and leads her on.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Solomon and his family make their way, among the slaves on the street, we see one in particular; JASPER.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he trails his MASTER he can't help but note Solomon and his family as they enter A STORE.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His intrigue of this most handsome and harmonious group should be obvious.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With his Master occupied, Jasper moves slyly toward the STORE.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Frozen on the spot, Jasper looks on admiringly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly a voice barks out-
{CHARACTER_NAME}: A VOICE (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: Jasper!
{DIALOGUE}: Come on!
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. STORE - LATER
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We are inside the store of MR. CEPHAS PARKER; a white man and a supplier of general goods.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon greets him
{META_DATA}: WITH:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: Mr. Parker.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PARKER
{DIALOGUE}: Mr. Northup.
{DIALOGUE}: Mrs. Northup.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With money in hand the Northup children move quickly about the store looking for items to purchase.
{META_DATA}: CONTINUED:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Anne looks over some silks and fabrics.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Parker suggests
{META_DATA}: TO SOLOMON:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PARKER (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: A new cravat, Solomon?
{DIALOGUE}: Pure silk by way of the French.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: We are in need of a fresh carry all for the Mrs's travels.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PARKER
{DIALOGUE}: A year's passed?
{DIALOGUE}: Off to Sandy Hill?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ANNE
{DIALOGUE}: I am.
{DIALOGUE}: Using a long pole, Mr. Parker fetches down a CARRY ALL from an upper shelf.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PARKER
{DIALOGUE}: Something to suit your style, but sturdy enough for the forty miles round trip.
{DIALOGUE}: Handing the Bag to Anne, she is immediately taken by it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ANNE
{DIALOGUE}: It's beautiful.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{META_DATA}: (CAUTIOUSLY)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At what price?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ANNE
{DIALOGUE}: We will take it.
{DIALOGUE}: Children, come see what your father has just purchased for me.
{DIALOGUE}: As the children run over - chattering excitedly about the new gift - they RUN PAST JASPER who has quietly entered the store.
{DIALOGUE}: At the checkout counter sits a portrait of WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON, the edges draped in black crepe.
{DIALOGUE}: Before the book sits a LEDGER.
{DIALOGUE}: Mr. Parker asks of Solomon:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PARKER
{DIALOGUE}: If you would sign our condolence book.
{DIALOGUE}: My hope is to find a way to forward it to the Widow Harrison.
{DIALOGUE}: Sad days for the nation.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, certainly.
{DIALOGUE}: Poor Mrs. Harris and her children.
{DIALOGUE}: I hope brighter times ahead.
{META_DATA}: (CONTINUED)
{META_DATA}: 4A.
{META_DATA}: 5 CONTINUED: (2)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Jasper looks scared, timid.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's as though he'd like to engage, but is unsure of as to how.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Noting Jasper, Parker
{META_DATA}: SAYS:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PARKER
{DIALOGUE}: A moment, sir, and you will be assisted.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: If we could discuss the price...
{META_DATA}: (CONTINUED)
{META_DATA}: 5.
{META_DATA}: 5 CONTINUED: (3)
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PARKER
{DIALOGUE}: Forgive me, Mrs. Northup.
{DIALOGUE}: A customer waits.
{DIALOGUE}: Welcome, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: To Jasper, with good nature:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: Shop well, but mind your wallet.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PARKER
{DIALOGUE}: Ignore the gentleman's nonsense.
{DIALOGUE}: Now, may I interest you in a new cravat?
{DIALOGUE}: Pure silk by way of the-- Before Parker can finish, the door opens.
{DIALOGUE}: It's Jasper's Master, FITZGERALD.
{DIALOGUE}: He's stern, clearly displeased.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FITZGERALD
{DIALOGUE}: Jasper!
{META_DATA}: (TO PARKER)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: My regrets for the intrusion.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: No intrusion.
{DIALOGUE}: Fitzgerald looks to Solomon.
{DIALOGUE}: It is a cold glare as though he wasn't speaking to, and has no interest in a response from a black man.
{DIALOGUE}: Looking back to Parker:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FITZGERALD
{DIALOGUE}: Good day, sir.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/DINING ROOM - EVENING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Anne, busy in the kitchen, puts the final touches to the meal, which is just about to begin.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon, in the meanwhile, sits at the head of the table reading from a NEWSPAPER.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He reads to his children solemn news of the funeral arrangements for the recently deceased President Harrison.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: "Thus has passed away from earth our late President."
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon starts from the top of the article.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: "During the morning, from sunrise, the heavy bells had been pealing forth their slow and solemn toll while the minute guns announced that soon the grave would receive its trust.
{DIALOGUE}: Our city as well as our entire nation has been called to weep over the fall of a great and good man.
{DIALOGUE}: One who was by the wishes of a large majority of our

{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: people raised to fill the highest place of trust within their gift.
{DIALOGUE}: William Henry Harrison."
{DIALOGUE}: A long moment of quiet, the family continuing to eat.
{DIALOGUE}: Then, from Margaret:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARGARET
{DIALOGUE}: Will you read it again?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ANNE
{DIALOGUE}: Not just now, darling.
{DIALOGUE}: Anne enters the dining room and places a large chicken at the center of the table.
{DIALOGUE}: As she takes a seat, all heads are bowed.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARGARET
{DIALOGUE}: For food that stays our hunger, For rest that brings us ease, For homes where memories linger, We give our thanks for these.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ALL
{DIALOGUE}: Amen.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: Margaret, that was wonderful.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARGARET
{DIALOGUE}: Thank you, Papa.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: Alonzo, do you have something to say?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ALONZO
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, I helped Momma make this.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ANNE
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, and you were such a good help.
{DIALOGUE}: Especially making the gravy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARGARET
{DIALOGUE}: Papa, I would very much like to learn how to play the violin.
{DIALOGUE}: Could you teach me?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ALONZO
{DIALOGUE}: Me too!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MARGARET
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, but I asked Papa first.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: Both of you, calm down.
{DIALOGUE}: We will have our first lesson after this wonderful dinner.
{DIALOGUE}: And on that note, let's start eating.
{META_DATA}: (CONTINUED)
{META_DATA}: 5B.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon and Anne have fun and difficulty putting the unruly children to bed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are tucked in, and each given a kiss good night.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Margaret lays down to sleep, Anne blows out the candle darkening the room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Silhouetted in the doorway, Solomon takes Anne in his arms, holds her tightly as they both luxuriate in the simple, beautiful gift that is their children.
{META_DATA}: 7A
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. NORTHUP HOUSE - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Now alone together, we see Anne and Solomon wrapped in each other's arms.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beyond being physically close, emotionally close, they are just so very comfortable with one another.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are the very representation of a couple who are made for each other.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They look at each other for a prolonged time.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{META_DATA}: (COMICALLY FORLORN)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Three weeks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Two days.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ANNE
{DIALOGUE}: It is the custom.

{DIALOGUE}: I won't stay idle.
{DIALOGUE}: SOLOMON's eyes lower.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ANNE
{DIALOGUE}: Darling, it's good money.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: If only I didn't have to share your cooking with other people.
{DIALOGUE}: ANNE holds his gaze.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Driver loads bags into the carriage.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For her parting gift, Anne gives her husband a kiss.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON

{CHARACTER_NAME}: ANNE

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. PARK - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon is now out for a stroll.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He passes two men - two in particular - who stand outside conversing with MR. MOON himself: MERRILL BROWN and ABRAM HAMILTON.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brown is about 40, with a countenance indicating shrewdness and intelligence.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hamilton is closer to 25, a man of fair complexion and light eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Both are finely, if perhaps a bit garishly, dressed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hamilton, as Solomon describes him, slightly effeminate.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Moon, spotting Solomon:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MR. MOON Call the Devil's name... There he is now.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mr. Northup...!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: I have two gentlemen who should make your acquaintance.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Messrs. Brown and Hamilton.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BROWN
{DIALOGUE}: Sir.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MR. MOON Mr. Northup, these two gentlemen were inquiring about distinguished individuals, and I was just this very moment telling them that Solomon Northup is an expert player on the violin.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMILTON
{DIALOGUE}: He was indeed.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: Mr. Moon is being overly gracious.
{META_DATA}: (CONTINUED)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 8.
{META_DATA}: 10 CONTINUED:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BROWN
{DIALOGUE}: Taking into consideration his graciousness and your modesty, may we trouble you for a moment of your time to converse, sir?
{META_DATA}: 11
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. PARK/PAVILION - LATER
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We make a jump to a green space.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon, Brown and Hamilton are sitting at a bench.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: A circus?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMILTON
{DIALOGUE}: That is our usual employee.
{DIALOGUE}: The company currently in the city of Washington.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BROWN
{DIALOGUE}: Circus too constricting a word to describe the talented and merry band with which we travel.
{DIALOGUE}: It is a spectacle unlike most have ever witnessed.
{DIALOGUE}: Creatures from the darkest Africa as yet unseen by civilized man.
{DIALOGUE}: Acrobats from the Orient able to contort themselves in the most confounding manners.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMILTON
{DIALOGUE}: And I myself in aide of Mr. Brown; an internationally renowned practitioner in the art of prestidigitation.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BROWN
{DIALOGUE}: We are on our way thither to rejoin the company having left for a short time to make a small profit from our own exhibitions.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMILTON
{DIALOGUE}: The reason for our inquiry with Mr. Moon...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BROWN
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{DIALOGUE}: We had just a devil of a time in procuring music for our

{DIALOGUE}: entertainments.
{DIALOGUE}: Men of true talent seemingly in short supply.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: Thank you sir...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BROWN
{DIALOGUE}: If we could persuade you to accompany us as far as New York... We would give you one dollar for each day's service and three dollars for every night played at our performances.
{DIALOGUE}: In addition we would provide sufficient pay for the expenses of your return from New York here to Saratoga.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: You understand this is all very sudden.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMILTON
{DIALOGUE}: Consider it an opportunity to see
{META_DATA}: THE COUNTRY--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: It's intriguing...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMILTON
{DIALOGUE}: If there is any way in which you would give consideration to the offer... Solomon gives the whole deal one last consideration.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: The payment offered is enticement enough, as is my desire to visit the metropolis.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMILTON
{DIALOGUE}: We are delighted, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: So delighted.
{DIALOGUE}: Though we would add that our travel plans--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BROWN
{DIALOGUE}: We would like to depart with haste.

{META_DATA}: 11 CONTINUED: (2)
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: As luck would have it, my wife and children are traveling.
{DIALOGUE}: I will write her of our plans.

{DIALOGUE}: Excellent!
{DIALOGUE}: I would beg you collect yourself, then we may proceed.
{META_DATA}: 12
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/BEDROOM - LATER
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Back in his house, we see Solomon packing: putting some clothes in a travel case, and collecting his violin as well.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 13 INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/STUDY - LATER
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon sits down to write a letter; pen poised over paper with already a few lines written.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But Solomon thinks better of it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WITH LITTLE THOUGHT HE TEARS THE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: PAPER AND SETS IT ASIDE.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WE SHOULD GET THE SENSE THAT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE BY LETTER
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: IS LOST ON SOLOMON.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THIS FACT WILL HAVE GREAT WEIGHT IN
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE NEAR FUTURE.
{META_DATA}: 14
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. SOLOMON'S HOUSE/INT. COVERED CARRIAGE - LATER
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon enters the buggy, carpet bag in hand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brown and Hamilton are waiting.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They ride in a covered carriage led by a pair of "noble" horses.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMILTON
{DIALOGUE}: No letter to post?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: No need.
{DIALOGUE}: My return will coincide with my family's.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BROWN
{DIALOGUE}: We're off then.
{META_DATA}: 15
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. PUB - EVENING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -MID TO LATE APRIL, 1841- We find ourselves in a roadside pub.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It serves the purpose of drinking and diversion, and little more.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Solomon plays his violin, Brown and Hamilton perform a decent, paired magic routine before a SPARSE AUDIENCE NOT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: OF "SELECT CHARACTER."
{META_DATA}: 11.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 16 INT. PUB - LATER
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After the show, the pub now fairly empty, Solomon, Hamilton and Brown sit down to eat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hamilton and Brown drink, but again Solomon abstains.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Though Solomon remains cool, Hamilton and Brown put up a great show of being disappointed as Hamilton counts out what little money was collected.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMILTON
{DIALOGUE}: Not an additional tip from a one of them.
{DIALOGUE}: They expect to be entertained for nothing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BROWN
{DIALOGUE}: And not satisfied a bit despite giving them more than what they paid for.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: It's the national mood.
{DIALOGUE}: There's too much grief to make room for frivolity.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMILTON
{DIALOGUE}: My sincerest apologies, Solomon.
{DIALOGUE}: You were promised opportunity, and you were given none.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BROWN
{DIALOGUE}: The opportunity is with the circus.
{DIALOGUE}: A two man show poorly promoted, what were we to expect?
{DIALOGUE}: But the circus bills itself.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMILTON
{DIALOGUE}: True.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BROWN
{DIALOGUE}: I have told you of the circus with which we are connected.
{DIALOGUE}: Creatures from the darkest of Africa.
{DIALOGUE}: Acrobats from the Orient who--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: You have described it, yes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BROWN
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{DIALOGUE}: We need to return immediately to Washington.
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon...I believe us familiar enough now, but forgive me if I am bold...would you consider making the trip with us?
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon gives a bit of a laugh at the idea.
{META_DATA}: (CONTINUED)
{META_DATA}: 12.
{META_DATA}: 16 CONTINUED:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMILTON
{DIALOGUE}: Entertaining at pubs and inns has it's place, but a man of your skills deserves better.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BROWN
{DIALOGUE}: Hear, hear.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMILTON
{DIALOGUE}: And more importantly you would build your own name and following.
{DIALOGUE}: The circus tends to attract those with the highest of reputations.
{DIALOGUE}: An introduction here and there could amount to a lifetime of reward.
{DIALOGUE}: Now would be the time.
{DIALOGUE}: With your family away, an opportunity presents itself.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BROWN
{DIALOGUE}: Said as fellow artists as well as businessmen.
{DIALOGUE}: Well worth the effort at least.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: You present a flattering representation.
{DIALOGUE}: As my family will be traveling back shortly, perhaps I might commit only to one trial engagement.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMILTON
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, very good, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: Very good.
{DIALOGUE}: I cannot recall being so excited.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BROWN
{DIALOGUE}: There is a practical concern.
{DIALOGUE}: If you are to continue on with us you should obtain your free papers.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: Not necessary.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BROWN
{DIALOGUE}: Here in New York, no.
{DIALOGUE}: But we will be entering slave states and as a matter of precaution... It's to all our benefit we should not have to come to account for your well being.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMILTON
{DIALOGUE}: Six shillings worth of effort could well save much trouble later.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brown counts out $43.00 IN COIN on the tabletop.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon is astonished by the amount.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BROWN
{DIALOGUE}: Forty-three dollars.
{DIALOGUE}: All to you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: That...it's far more than my wages amount to.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BROWN
{DIALOGUE}: Consider the remainder an advance from the circus.
{DIALOGUE}: I cannot tell you...I honestly wish you had seen the expression of our director when I described your abilities.
{DIALOGUE}: He was fairly overcome with excitement.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMILTON
{DIALOGUE}: You should have invited him to sup with us.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BROWN
{DIALOGUE}: I did.
{DIALOGUE}: I did, but so many preparations before the company is to depart.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he strokes Solomon's sweaty face, Hamilton speaks sweetly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMILTON
{DIALOGUE}: I'm afraid that Brown and I haven't brought you much luck.
{DIALOGUE}: But rough waters bring smooth sailing.
{DIALOGUE}: Eventually they do.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: ....So...so sorry...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMILTON
{DIALOGUE}: Shhh.
{DIALOGUE}: We won't hear it.
{DIALOGUE}: We won't.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BROWN
{DIALOGUE}: Let him sleep.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMILTON
{DIALOGUE}: Hmm.
{DIALOGUE}: A good night's sleep.
{DIALOGUE}: And tomorrow...tomorrow you will feel as well and refreshed as though the earth were new again.
{DIALOGUE}: Hamilton lingers a bit too long and a bit too close to Solomon for Brown's taste.
{DIALOGUE}: With more than a bit of
{META_DATA}: SIGNIFICATION:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BROWN
{DIALOGUE}: Hamilton!
{DIALOGUE}: Nothing more we can do for him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HAMILTON
{DIALOGUE}: Such is the pity.
{DIALOGUE}: Displaying an odd sort of disappointment, Hamilton slinks away from the bed.
{DIALOGUE}: He crosses to, and BLOWS OUT A CANDLE.
{DIALOGUE}: The room goes dark with a blackness more than night.
{DIALOGUE}: Brown and Hamilton exit.
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon lays in the dark and moans.
{DIALOGUE}: His sounds becoming MORE AND MORE

{META_DATA}: 24 CONTINUED:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon stirs, then slowly awakes to his new circumstances.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He finds himself in a nearly lightless room about twelve feet square with walls of solid masonry.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is a thick and well-locked door, a small window covered with iron bars and a shutter.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The only furniture is a wood stool and an old fashioned, dirty box stove.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Solomon rises he sees that his HANDS are CUFFED - the chain running to a bolt in the ground - and his LEGS IN IRONS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At first Solomon is incredulous.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But that emotion is replaced first by fury and then panic.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He begins to pull on the chains, fight against them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He does so with increasing desperation.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon flails about, the sounds of the steel chains whipping and beating against the masonry.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He grunts and screams without regard as the cuffs and irons bite into his flesh, but he cannot pull himself free.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After several minutes of intense effort, Solomon tires, slows, then finally he collapses.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And in this collapsed state he remains.
{META_DATA}: 25
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. BURCH'S DUNGEON - MORNING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon again awakens.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He hears sounds beyond the door...footsteps.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Eventually the door opens.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Enter JAMES BURCH - who runs the slave pen - and EBENEZER RADBURN who works as a turnkey and overseer.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the door opens, this is the first light to seep into the otherwise near-black room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The shine is painful to Solomon's eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With no salutation whatsoever, Burch
{META_DATA}: ASKS:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURCH
{DIALOGUE}: Well, my boy, how yah feel now?
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon rises up as best he can.
{DIALOGUE}: With all the resolve he can put together he states what he considers to be fact:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: I am Solomon Northup.
{DIALOGUE}: I am a free man; a resident of Saratoga, New York.
{DIALOGUE}: The residence also of my wife and children who are equally free.
{DIALOGUE}: I have papers.
{DIALOGUE}: You have no right whatsoever to detain me--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURCH
{DIALOGUE}: Yah not any--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: And I promise you - I promise - upon my liberation I will have satisfaction for this wrong.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURCH
{DIALOGUE}: Resolve this.
{DIALOGUE}: Produce your papers.
{META_DATA}: (CONTINUED)
{META_DATA}: 17.
{META_DATA}: 25 CONTINUED:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With confidence Solomon goes to the pocket of his trousers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He searches one, then the other, but they are empty.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He feels quickly about himself, but clearly his papers have been lifted.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon's confidence shifts, but to resolve rather than fear.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Papers or none, he will not be easily cowed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Still, Burch asserts:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURCH (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: Yah no free man.
{DIALOGUE}: And yah ain't from Saratoga.
{DIALOGUE}: Yah from Georgia.
{DIALOGUE}: A moment.
{DIALOGUE}: Not a word spoken among the trio, but Solomon and Burch do some serious eye fucking, neither man yielding.
{DIALOGUE}: Burch says again:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURCH (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: Yah ain't a free man.
{DIALOGUE}: Yah nuthin' but a Georgia runaway.
{DIALOGUE}: Burch waits for Solomon to acquiesce.
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon does not in any way.
{DIALOGUE}: Both men exchange a long and daring stare.
{DIALOGUE}: The two are clearly at an intellectual stand off.
{DIALOGUE}: Burch, leans to Radburn, SAYS SOMETHING WHICH WE CANNOT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: DISTINGUISH.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Radburn walks off-camera and returns with a pair of "instruments:" a PADDLE - the flattened portion, which is about the size in circumference of two open hands, and bored with a small auger in numerous places.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He also carries a WHIP.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A cat-o-nine tails; a large rope of many strands.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The strands unraveled and a knot tied at the extremity of each.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Burch says again:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURCH (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: Yah a runaway nigger from Georgia.
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon stands with a quiet stoicism.
{DIALOGUE}: He will say nothing of the kind.
{DIALOGUE}: As that is the case, Solomon is seized by both men.
{DIALOGUE}: He is pulled over the bench, face downward, shirt still on his back.
{DIALOGUE}: Radburn then STEPS ON HIS CHAINS, holding Solomon down in a bent position.
{DIALOGUE}: With no preamble, Burch begins to beat Solomon about the back with the paddle.
{DIALOGUE}: Burch strikes him wordlessly - no taunting, no sneering.
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon screaming against each blow.
{DIALOGUE}: His back immediately SWELLING WITH WELTS AND
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: BRUISES.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This beating continues on and on and on until quite literally Burch WEARS HIMSELF OUT with the effort.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dripping in sweat and panting:
{META_DATA}: (CONTINUED)
{META_DATA}: 18.
{META_DATA}: 25 CONTINUED: (2)
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURCH (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: Yah still insist yah a free man?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: ...I..
{DIALOGUE}: I insist... Burch regrets hearing this.
{DIALOGUE}: Not from sympathy, but rather because he's nearly too tired to go back to beating Solomon.
{DIALOGUE}: Yet, as if returning to work, Burch returns to pummeling Solomon.
{DIALOGUE}: Burch punctuates the blows
{META_DATA}: WITH:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURCH
{DIALOGUE}: Yah a slave.
{DIALOGUE}: Yah a Georgia slave!
{DIALOGUE}: Burch continues to strike, and strike... This time until the paddle SNAPS IN HALF.
{DIALOGUE}: Burch then GRABS THE WHIP.
{DIALOGUE}: Hardly missing a stroke, he whips Solomon relentlessly, the flails cutting into Solomon's back.
{DIALOGUE}: Again, Burch's arm tires before Solomon "breaks."
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BURCH (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: Are yah slave?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: ...No... Burch goes back to whipping and whipping, and whipping...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SOLOMON'S BACK IS NOW TORN OPEN WITH LACERATIONS AND OOZING WITH BLOOD.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Finally Burch can whip no more.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pours sweat and sucks air, leaving himself just enough energy to take up his instruments and EXIT.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Radburn lingers for a moment.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes the irons off Solomon's legs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Opens the window some.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he makes these gestures, in a patronizing and confidential manner, one wrought with poor sincerity::
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RADBURN
{DIALOGUE}: I seen a good many of the black kind just where yah're.
{DIALOGUE}: Sick.
{DIALOGUE}: Make me sick.
{DIALOGUE}: Often times the situation was resolved, and I think; what was all the beatin' and abuse for?
{DIALOGUE}: Things end as they should, and the violence was for naught.
{DIALOGUE}: So why cause trouble when they ain't no cause for it?
{DIALOGUE}: Be of a cooperative nature, and things don't need be particularly unpleasant.
{META_DATA}: (BEAT)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Or, yah can carry on like yah been, and I fear yah won't live to see Sunday next.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: With that thought, Radburn exits.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon rests.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But to rest seems like giving in to defeat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He begins pulling
{META_DATA}: (CONTINUED)
{META_DATA}: 19.
{META_DATA}: 25 CONTINUED: (3)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: on his chains.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But for all his struggling, the chain loosens none.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon calls out:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: Help me!
{DIALOGUE}: Someone help me!
{DIALOGUE}: If anyone at all hears him, they do not respond.
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon continues his plaintive cry for assistance.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beginning with a TIGHT SHOT on the shuttered, barred window of Burch's dungeon - Solomon's cries barely eking beyond the space - THE CAMERA PULLS BACK from the building, onto the city until clearly visible is the Nation's capital.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's icon's of freedom - the WHITE HOUSE, the CAPITOL BUILDING - fairly mocking Solomon's captivity.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The yard is hemmed in by a brick wall.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In the yard are two men, and a boy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The oldest is CLEMENS RAY a man of about 25 years of age.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is well educated.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: JOHN WILLIAMS is about 20 years old.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is born and bred a slave, is lacking in education, and overwhelmed with fear of the situation.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Finally there is a child about 10 years of age who answers to the name of Randall.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon, Clemens Ray, John and Randall ALL STAND NAKED.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Though they try to cover their privates a bit, they are all aware of the uselessness of modesty.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Radburn is present.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He has before him A COUPLE OF BUCKETS OF COLD WATER.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He throws water on the naked men.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RADBURN
{DIALOGUE}: Go on.
{DIALOGUE}: Warsh up.
{DIALOGUE}: The men, soaking in humility as well as water, begin to scrub with A SINGLE BAR OF HARSH SOAP passed among them.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RADBURN (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: The boy, too.
{DIALOGUE}: Get him clean.
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon takes some soap and rubs it over Randall.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RADBURN (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: Scrub now.
{DIALOGUE}: Git 'em clean.
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon scrubs harder.
{DIALOGUE}: Randall - clearly cold and uncomfortable - appeals to Solomon.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RANDALL
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know when my Mama will come?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RADBURN
{DIALOGUE}: Hush him up!
{DIALOGUE}: Seeing Solomon has no answer for him, Randall begins to cry.

{DIALOGUE}: Please.

{DIALOGUE}: On the seeming strength of Solomon's promise, Randall goes silent.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Radburn brings food in to Solomon; a shriveled piece of meat and some water.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just barely enough to sustain Solomon.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Radburn also has a SHIRT.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RADBURN
{DIALOGUE}: That old thing of yours is just rags and tatters.
{DIALOGUE}: Need something proper to wear.
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon doesn't move for the clothing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RADBURN (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: Go'won.
{DIALOGUE}: Put it on.
{DIALOGUE}: With slow defiance, Solomon does as instructed.
{DIALOGUE}: He removes what remains of his old shirt - the one he was wearing when first kidnapped - and puts on the one Radburn brought him.
{DIALOGUE}: The shirt's ill-fitting and dirty.
{DIALOGUE}: Despite that, Radburn says:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RADBURN (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: There.
{DIALOGUE}: Tha's fine.
{DIALOGUE}: Tha's fine.
{DIALOGUE}: Got no gratitude?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON

{DIALOGUE}: This can't stand.
{DIALOGUE}: It is a crime.
{DIALOGUE}: I believe now someone lay in wait for me.
{DIALOGUE}: My drink was altered... We are free men.
{DIALOGUE}: They have...they have no right to hold us.
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon waits for a response from the others.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: The two men I journeyed with.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm certain they're making inquires at this very moment.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLEMENS
{DIALOGUE}: I would be just as certain they are counting the money paid for delivering you to this place.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: They were not kidnappers.
{DIALOGUE}: They were artists.

{DIALOGUE}: The reality to come is us being transported southward.

{DIALOGUE}: After we arrive, we'll be put to market.
{DIALOGUE}: Beyond that... Well, once in a slave state I suppose there's only one outcome.

{DIALOGUE}: All three men turn and look.
{DIALOGUE}: At the moment Randall doesn't call out emptily.
{DIALOGUE}: At the door to the yard is Burch along with two women.
{DIALOGUE}: One in her late twenties; ELIZA.
{DIALOGUE}: She is "arrayed in silk, with rings upon her fingers, and golden ornaments suspended from her ears."
{DIALOGUE}: Though a slave, Eliza was a mistress and has - to this point - lived well.
{DIALOGUE}: This is reflected in her airs and her speech.
{DIALOGUE}: The other is a little girl, light in skin color, of about seven or eight.
{DIALOGUE}: This is EMILY, Randall's half sister.
{DIALOGUE}: As she enters the yard Eliza squeals with high delight, then breaks into tears of both sorrow and joy.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Both slyly, and with a bit of aggrandizement:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ELIZA
{DIALOGUE}: When I say I had my master's favor, you understand.
{DIALOGUE}: Above even his own wife, I had it.
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know that he built a house for me?
{DIALOGUE}: Built it on the sole condition that I reside there with him.
{DIALOGUE}: The added promise in time I would be emancipated.
{DIALOGUE}: And for nine years he blessed me with every comfort and luxury in life.
{DIALOGUE}: Displaying the finery she still wears:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ELIZA (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: Silks and jewels and even servants to wait upon us.
{DIALOGUE}: Such was our life, and the life of this beautiful girl I bore for him.
{DIALOGUE}: But Master Berry's daughter...she always looked at me with an unkind nature.
{DIALOGUE}: She hated Emily no matter she and Emily were flesh of flesh.
{DIALOGUE}: As Master Berry's health failed, she gained power in the household.
{DIALOGUE}: Eventually, I was brought to the city on the false pretense of our free papers being executed.
{DIALOGUE}: If I had known what waited; to be sent south?

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon stares down Burch for as long as he can, as if wishing bad things.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mistress Ford is present as well.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the slaves listen, Ford reads to them Scripture.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His tone is of a man trying to preach by way of compassion.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FORD
{DIALOGUE}: "But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
{DIALOGUE}: God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
{DIALOGUE}: And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.
{DIALOGUE}: Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law?
{DIALOGUE}: Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
{DIALOGUE}: This is the first and great commandment.
{DIALOGUE}: And the second is like unto it, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
{DIALOGUE}: On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."
{DIALOGUE}: Despite the lightness with which Ford speaks and the hope in his words, ELIZA SITS OFF TO THE SIDE - SELF-SECLUDED
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A BIT - WEEPING GENTLY.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We should be able to see in Mistress Ford's eyes that Eliza's constant crying is unsettling.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -MID JUNE, 1841- The slaves have broken for lunch.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They snack on smoked meat and drink water from gourds.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As they lunch Solomon reads from Sam's Bible to the other slaves.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: But he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.
{DIALOGUE}: For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth?
{DIALOGUE}: Is not he that sitteth at meat?
{DIALOGUE}: But I am among you as he that serveth.
{DIALOGUE}: A white customer - WINSLOW - irate at the sight and sound of slaves reading Scripture, crosses over.
{DIALOGUE}: He grabs the Bible.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WINSLOW
{DIALOGUE}: From where did you thieve this?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SAM
{DIALOGUE}: Suh, the book is my property.
{DIALOGUE}: The White Customer has no interest in Sam's answer.
{DIALOGUE}: With flailing hands he STARTS BEATING ON SAM.
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon tries to stop him.
{DIALOGUE}: That only makes the situation worse, Solomon now the target of the man's ire.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WINSLOW
{DIALOGUE}: Take your hands from me!
{DIALOGUE}: Ford comes running over.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FORD
{DIALOGUE}: What is the commotion?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WINSLOW
{DIALOGUE}: Your niggers are either brazen or rebellious.
{DIALOGUE}: This one was readin' Scripture, and this one claims it to be his.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: FORD
{DIALOGUE}: It is.
{DIALOGUE}: A gift from his Mistress.

{DIALOGUE}: You condone this?

{DIALOGUE}: He yells back at Ford:

{DIALOGUE}: And the man who would allow a slave to read is unfit to own niggers!
{DIALOGUE}: Handing the Bible back to Sam, very matter of factly:

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Slaves trudge alongside, same as it ever was.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Only...it's not quite the same.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sam brings the wagon to a halt.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He, and the slaves look up the road ahead of them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Standing in the middle of the road is a group of CHICKASAWS INDIANS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are in their "usual" dress of buckskin breeches and calico hunting shirts of fantastic colors, buttoned from belt to chin.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They have with them DOGS and HORSES.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They carry with them the carcass of a deer.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. FIELD - DUSK/END OF DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The groups of slaves and Chickasaws are now intermingled.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They "break bread" - actually they work on the carcass of the deer which is now roasting over a large fire.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As well the group share a smoke on a pipe.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: One of the Chickasaws is playing a tune on an "INDIAN FIDDLE."
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Chickasaws perform a customary dance; trotting after each other, and giving utterance to a guttural, sing-song noise.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The slaves enjoy the respite from work, Solomon particularly taken by the music...if not entirely enthralled by it.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lowering his trousers, SOLOMON SQUATS TO DEFECATE.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As he does, he stares out toward the flowing waters of Indian Creek.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: After a few moments, as though a thought far greater than relieving himself has come to him, Solomon stands and replaces his pants.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Oddly, Solomon stares out at the water as though he were a man possessed.
{META_DATA}: 75
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. FORD'S WORK AREA - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just beyond the WORK AREA Solomon speaks with Ford as Tibeats listens.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon is drawing in the dirt, making rough diagrams for Ford as he explains himself.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: The creek is plenty deep enough to sail, even with a boat full of load.
{DIALOGUE}: The distance from the WORK AREA to the point on the latter bayou is several miles by water fewer than land.
{DIALOGUE}: It occurs to me that the expense of the transportation would be materially
{META_DATA}: DIMINISHED--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TIBEATS
{DIALOGUE}: "Materially diminished?"
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: If we use the waterway.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TIBEATS
{DIALOGUE}: It's a scheme.
{DIALOGUE}: Plenty of engineers have schemed similarly.
{DIALOGUE}: The passes are too tight.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: I reckon them at more than twelve feet at their most narrow.
{DIALOGUE}: Wide enough for a tub to traverse.
{DIALOGUE}: A team of niggers can clear it out.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -END OF JUNE, 1841- WE HAVE A SERIES OF SCENES in which we see Solomon and a TEAM OF BLACKS working on the creek: CHOPPING TREES ALONG THE BANKS, widening out the shore... It's all just a trial for now.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The work is diligent, but it is basic to this point.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Still, under Solomon's direction, the slaves go at it like they've got something to prove.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And rightly they do.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon also works on a narrow raft of twelve cribs with which he will transport the timber.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Once this is constructed, HE PERSONALLY "SAILS" THEM UP

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. FORD PLANTATION/GREAT HOUSE - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As we come into the scene, Ford is presenting Solomon with a fiddle.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Not as grand as the one he previously owned in New York, but a fine instrument none the less.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is a gift of thanks for his hard work.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon's gratitude is easily expressed.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: FORD
{DIALOGUE}: My thanks to you, and it is the least of it.
{DIALOGUE}: My hope is that it brings us both much joy over the years.
{DIALOGUE}: Following the statement, Solomon's not sure how to react.
{DIALOGUE}: He remains grateful, but the thought of "over the years" is just a reminder of the altered state in which he now finds himself.

{DIALOGUE}: Nothing.
{DIALOGUE}: You are no better than prized livestock.
{DIALOGUE}: Call for him.
{DIALOGUE}: Call, tell him of your previous circumstances and see what it earns you...Solomon.
{DIALOGUE}: Eliza uses Solomon's name quite pointedly as if to underscore his true self.
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon get her meaning.
{DIALOGUE}: Yet he says nothing.

{DIALOGUE}: The phrase seems to trigger Eliza's tears.
{DIALOGUE}: She begins to sob uncontrollably.
{DIALOGUE}: Mrs. Ford turns to Rachel in a hushed whisper-
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MRS. FORD I cannot have that kind of depression about.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon, pretending not to have heard, slowly turns to Eliza with worry.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ford continues to preach over Eliza's keening.

{DIALOGUE}: It involves an inconsolable Eliza who is being herded by Sam onto a cart DRIVEN BY A WHITE MAN.

{DIALOGUE}: Murder!

{DIALOGUE}: He looks around, not sure what to do; to stay or to flee.
{DIALOGUE}: Anxiety mounts on his features.
{DIALOGUE}: A moment more, and Tibeats EXITS the house.
{DIALOGUE}: He saddles his horse and rides off to beat the devil.
{DIALOGUE}: Or, worse, to fetch him.
{DIALOGUE}: Chapin comes running back out of the house.
{DIALOGUE}: He is visibly excited, and when he speaks he is quite earnest.
{DIALOGUE}: Though he tries to project reasoned emotions he gives off an air of impending trouble.

{DIALOGUE}: Solomon is now very much alone, and he waits for what is to come.
{DIALOGUE}: AND WE WAIT WITH HIM.
{DIALOGUE}: And we wait, and we continue to wait... Moment by moment, the dread of the unexpected mounts.
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon's eyes begin to well.

{DIALOGUE}: Solomon tries to fight back, but he is strong armed and tied by TIBEATS - his wrists, and then ankles bound in the same manner.
{DIALOGUE}: In the meantime the other two have slipped a cord within Solomon's elbows, running it across his back and tying it firmly.
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon is then dragged toward a peach tree.
{DIALOGUE}: A lynching is in store.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: Master Epps has somehow come to believe, as incorrectly as it may be, that Master Shaw is... That he is something of a lothario and an unprincipled man.
{DIALOGUE}: A misguided belief born out of their mutual competition as planters, no doubt.

{DIALOGUE}: A small and reasonable price to be paid 'fo sure.
{DIALOGUE}: Looking toward Patsey, speaking with great empathy:

{DIALOGUE}: I knowed what it like to be the object of Massa's predilections and peculiarities.
{DIALOGUE}: And I knowed they can get expressed with kindness or wit violence.
{DIALOGUE}: A lusty visit in the night, or a visitation from the whip.
{DIALOGUE}: And wit my experience, if'n I can give comfort, then comfort I give.

{DIALOGUE}: Epps gives chase.
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon begins to run around the large pig sty, easily keeping his distance.
{DIALOGUE}: Epps, however is undeterred.
{DIALOGUE}: He moves after Solomon as speedily as he can, which isn't very speedily at all.
{DIALOGUE}: And quickly he tires.
{DIALOGUE}: Epps is forced to bend over and suck air.
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon maintains his distance, barely breathing hard.
{DIALOGUE}: His breath returned to him, Epps starts up the chase again.
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon runs on out of reach.
{DIALOGUE}: Shortly, Epps again stops, gets his breath... And now in what should be quite comical, Epps again runs after Solomon.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is rough and clumsy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It looks like something between an awkward rape and a virgin attempting his first sexual encounter.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Patsey does not respond in any way other than to continually turn her head from Epps, but otherwise remain as still as possible.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: If there is such a thing, she is vicious with her passive aggressiveness.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He begins slapping Patsey to get a response from her.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When that fails, he punches her which only leads to him taking up his whip and lashing Patsey MERCILESSLY.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ANNA IS JUST SO VERY, VERY DESPERATE FOR HUMAN CONTACT,
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: FOR THE NEED TO FEEL ALIVE AND LIKE A PERSON RATHER THAN
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: AN ANIMAL THAT EMOTIONALLY SHE IS WILLING TO ENGAGE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SOLOMON.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The need quickly compounds.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Anna presses her lips to Solomon's.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Eventually, SHE DIRECTS HIS HAND BENEATH HER DRESS AND BETWEEN HER LEGS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon, with slightly more compassion than a guy making union wages, BEGINS TO MANIPULATE ANNA WITH HIS HAND.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The act remains more perfunctory than passionate.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We can see Anna moving toward climax and eventual release.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But more - or substantially less - than joyous sex, it is really just a drug-like inoculation against reality.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But the feeling quickly fades.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All that remains, as with most chance encounters, is regret.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And there is shame, too.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is put on display as Anna turns away from Solomon.

{DIALOGUE}: Do it, Platt.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't stop until I am dead.
{DIALOGUE}: What else can he do?
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon begins to whip, to truly whip Patsey.
{DIALOGUE}: Her back welts, then tears... Patsey screams in agony.
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon strikes again and again... After a full thirty lashes Solomon looks to Epps, who is not satisfied.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EPPS
{DIALOGUE}: Until I say no more!
{DIALOGUE}: I ain't said nothing!
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon strikes another ten to fifteen times.
{DIALOGUE}: By now, as promised, Patsey's back has been reduced to LITTLE MORE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THAN TORN MEAT AND BLOOD.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Finally, Solomon holds low the whip.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He can and will do no more.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EPPS (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: Strike her!
{DIALOGUE}: Strike her!
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon will not.
{DIALOGUE}: Epps takes up the whip and whips Patsey with "ten fold" greater force than he had.
{DIALOGUE}: The painfully loud and angry curses of Epps load the air.
{DIALOGUE}: Patsey by now is terribly lacerated, literally flayed.
{DIALOGUE}: The lash wet with blood which flowed down her sides and dropped upon the ground.
{DIALOGUE}: At length Patsey ceases struggling.
{DIALOGUE}: Her head sinks listlessly on the ground.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon, screaming at Epps:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: Thou devil!
{DIALOGUE}: Sooner or later, somewhere in the course of eternal justice thou shalt answer for this sin!
{DIALOGUE}: Though Epps fronts rage, there should be underlying anguish for what he has done to his beloved Pats.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EPPS
{DIALOGUE}: No sin!
{DIALOGUE}: There is no sin!
{DIALOGUE}: A man does how he pleases with his property.
{DIALOGUE}: At the moment, Platt, I am of great pleasure.
{DIALOGUE}: You be goddamn careful I don't come to wantin' to lightenin' my mood no further.
{DIALOGUE}: By contrast to this horror, the field of cotton smiles in the warm sunlight.
{DIALOGUE}: The birds chirp merrily amidst the foliage of the tress.
{DIALOGUE}: Peace and happiness seems to reign everywhere.
{DIALOGUE}: Everywhere else.
{DIALOGUE}: Epps leaves Patsey to herself.
{DIALOGUE}: He says not a word to the Mistress as he passes.
{DIALOGUE}: The Mistress herself heads back into the house.
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon unties Patsey, lifts her and takes her to the cabin.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Patsey is laid on some boards where she remains for a long time with eyes closed and groaning in agony.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: From the amount of work that's been done on it, it should be obvious that days have now passed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon makes a cautious approach to Bass.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As casually as he can he inquires:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: Master Bass, I want to ask you what part of the country you came from?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BASS
{DIALOGUE}: No part of this land.
{DIALOGUE}: I was born in Canada.
{DIALOGUE}: Now guess where that is.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, I know where Canada is.
{DIALOGUE}: I have been there myself.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BASS
{DIALOGUE}: Have you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: Montreal and Kingston and Queenston and a great many places.
{DIALOGUE}: And I have been in York state, too.
{DIALOGUE}: Buffalo and Rochester and Albany, and can tell you the names of the villages on the Erie canal and the Champlain canal.
{DIALOGUE}: Bass gives Solomon a long and curious stare.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BASS
{DIALOGUE}: Well traveled for a slave.
{DIALOGUE}: How came you here?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: Master Bass, if justice had been done I never would have been here.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BASS
{DIALOGUE}: How's this?
{DIALOGUE}: Tell me all about it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: I am afraid to tell you, though I don't believe you would tell Master Epps if I should.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BASS
{DIALOGUE}: Every word you speak is a profound secret.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Prior to Solomon stating his case, WE FADE TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 161 INT. MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION / ADDITION - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hours have passed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Bass reflects on the story that Epps has told in the intervening.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BASS
{DIALOGUE}: How many years all told?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: Just nearly...just passed eleven.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BASS
{DIALOGUE}: Your story is...it is amazing, and in no good way.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: Do you believe, sir, in justice as you have said?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BASS
{DIALOGUE}: I do.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: That slavery is an evil that should befall none?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BASS
{DIALOGUE}: I believe so.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: If you truly do, I would ask...I would beg that you write my friends in the north, acquainting them with my situation and beseeching them to forward free papers, or take such steps as they might consider proper to secure my release.
{DIALOGUE}: Bass looks at Solomon, holding his gaze for more than a prolonged beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: My daughter Margaret is possibly now 19 and my son Alonzo, 16.
{DIALOGUE}: I miss them so.
{DIALOGUE}: It would be an unspeakable happiness to clasp my wife and my family again.
{DIALOGUE}: Bass hands Solomon an end of a long plank of wood and looks over his shoulder, as if to camouflage the conversation by work.
{DIALOGUE}: They both lift it toward the floorboards.
{DIALOGUE}: Finally Bass speaks.
{META_DATA}: (CONTINUED)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 116.
{META_DATA}: 161 CONTINUED:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BASS
{DIALOGUE}: I have always forgone relationships and family.
{DIALOGUE}: I did once have a sweetheart who I loved deeply.
{DIALOGUE}: Bass points to a measuring tool, which Solomon immediately hands over.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BASS (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: But that was a long, long time ago.
{DIALOGUE}: I've been traveling this country for the best part of twenty years.
{DIALOGUE}: My freedom is everything.
{DIALOGUE}: The fact that I can walk out of here tomorrow gives me most pleasure.
{DIALOGUE}: I see the aching in your eyes, the pain of not being attached to your loved ones.
{DIALOGUE}: My life doesn't mean much to anyone, but it seems your life means a lot to a lot of people.
{DIALOGUE}: What you have just said to me scares me, and I must say, sir, I am afraid.
{DIALOGUE}: Not just for you, but for me.
{DIALOGUE}: They continue working, fixing the floorboards in unison.
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon, slightly confused.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BASS (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: I will write your letter sir, for if I could bring freedom to you, it will be more than a pleasure.
{DIALOGUE}: It will be a duty.
{DIALOGUE}: Now, would you be so kind as to pass me those nails, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: We pull back to reveal the two men dwarfed by the unfinished structure.

{DIALOGUE}: To a now virtually complete, half-painted white gazebo.
{DIALOGUE}: Slaves continue to work on it.
{DIALOGUE}: As they do so, Bass peels away from the structure to have an overview.
{DIALOGUE}: He beckons Solomon toward him, out of earshot from the slaves who are continuing to work on the gazebo.
{DIALOGUE}: As Solomon approaches, Bass shouts-
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BASS
{DIALOGUE}: And bring those markers!
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon gathers a clutch of markers in his hands and approaches Bass.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BASS (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: No letter yet.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SOLOMON
{DIALOGUE}: You are certain?
{DIALOGUE}: Bass takes a marker from Solomon and slides it into the earth.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BASS
{DIALOGUE}: I have inquired thoroughly.
{DIALOGUE}: More than is safe for either of us.
{DIALOGUE}: Bass takes another and pokes it into the ground, improvising a pathway towards the gazebo.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BASS (CONT'D)
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon...I have a job or two on hand which will be completed shortly... The work here has grown sparse.

{DIALOGUE}: Go home knowing you have tried.
{DIALOGUE}: The weight of defeat should hang very heavily with both men.
{DIALOGUE}: Nothing more to do, nothing more to say BASS TAKES
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SOLOMON'S HAND, GRIPS IT FIRMLY, BUT LOW AND SURREPTITIOUSLY knowing full well he cannot be seen making contact with a slave.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But in the strength of their collective grip, in the emotion in which they hold each other's eyes, we should be able to easily see how greatly Bass wanted to be able to help Solomon.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Equally, we can see the depth of regard Solomon has for Bass.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The moment is made all the more powerful by the fact neither man can openly speak his regret or thanks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A moment longer, and then Bass releases his grip and makes his way marching toward the gazebo, pointing instructions.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon sits on a secluded part of the road, fiddle in hand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stares across the expanse.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His eyes fixed on something that is a million miles away.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Slowly Solomon tunes his fiddle, turning the tuning peg tighter and tighter.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the strings are taut, the sound is almost unbearable as Solomon tightens bit by bit, as if bones are being cracked one by one.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Just beyond the breaking point of sound, there is a snap.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He then repeats the action.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Solomon holds the neck of the violin.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sliding his thumb and forefinger down the neck, he methodically cracks it at the base.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He carefully snaps the neck and removes it from the body, then snaps it in two, placing it on the ground.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He then starts on the body.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Heaving it on the ground, it falls apart.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Methodically he breaks the violin into small bits - silencing the instrument with a hushed display of violence, rather than aggressive.

{DIALOGUE}: Mr. Parker?
{DIALOGUE}: As he does, Epps makes his way over.

{DIALOGUE}: To hell with that!
{DIALOGUE}: My nigger, and I'll fight you for 'em!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PARKER
{DIALOGUE}: As is your right.
{DIALOGUE}: As it will be my pleasure to bankrupt you in the courts.
{DIALOGUE}: Your decision.
{DIALOGUE}: By this time, the slaves in the plantation have overcome their fear of penalty, and left their work and gathered in the yard as witnesses.
{DIALOGUE}: They stand behind the cabin, out of sight of Epps.
{DIALOGUE}: Mistress Epps also bears witness, standing on the veranda next to her house slave.
{DIALOGUE}: Her face is of a strange mixed emotion.
{DIALOGUE}: Epps looks to Solomon.
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon icily, stoically holds his ground.
{DIALOGUE}: He makes it quite clear in his countenance that nobody owns him.
{DIALOGUE}: Sheriff, hand on his gun, is there to back Solomon up.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: PATSEY
{DIALOGUE}: Platt... Disregarding Parker, Solomon crosses over to Patsey.
{DIALOGUE}: Under the circumstances, neither really knows how to engage.
{DIALOGUE}: Finally, suddenly, Patsey throws her arms around Solomon and they embrace.
{DIALOGUE}: Epps, now mounted on his horse, witness the encounter.
{DIALOGUE}: Kicking the stirrups hard into the sides of the horse, he rides off furiously.
{DIALOGUE}: Calling from the carriage, mindful of Epps:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PARKER
{DIALOGUE}: Solomon...if we know what's wise, we should depart.
{DIALOGUE}: A moment longer Solomon and Patsey hold each other.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The family waits patiently, dutifully...but anxiously.
