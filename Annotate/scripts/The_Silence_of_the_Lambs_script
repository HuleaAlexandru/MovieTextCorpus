{META_DATA}: Based on the novel by
{META_DATA}: Thomas Harris
{META_DATA}: FADE IN:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. GRUBBY HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY (DIMLY LIT)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A woman's face BACKS INTO SHOT, her head resting against grimy wallpaper.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She is tense, sweaty, wide-eyed with concentration.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is CLARICE STARLING, mid-20's, trim, very pretty.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She wears Kevlar body armor over a navy windbreaker, khaki pants.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her thick hair is piled under a navy baseball cap.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A revolver, clutched in her right hand, hovers by her ear.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She raises a speedloader, in her left hand, locks it into her cylinder, twists and reloads.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLOSE ON
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A guest room door, with a small, wired pack attached to its knob.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, wish a sharp CRACK!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: , the knob explodes, and the door bursts open.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WITH CLARICE - MOVING SHOT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as she runs around a corner, through a cloud of smoke.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She shoulders aside the shattered door and rushes inside, gun at the ready in both hands...
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLARICE'S POV - MOVING - as she first sees, sitting on the edge of a bed - a FEMALE HOSTAGE.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Black, late 20's, gagged, hands behind her back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, SWIVELLING... she sees a startled MALE SUSPECT, white, mid-20's, standing by a window with a rifle in his hands.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is turning towards her...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice drops into a combat crouch, gun extended, and shouts.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Freeze!
{DIALOGUE}: FBI!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLARICE'S POV - SLOW MOTION
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: all natural SOUND suspended - as the Suspect faces her with a strange, pleading expression.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The rifle is rising in his hands, but oddly enough, it is held across his chest, not pointing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then another puzzling detail registers...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE SUSPECT'S HANDS
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: are taped to his gun, away from the trigger; he couldn't use it even if he tried.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly we hear a metallic CLICK, which registers with unnatural amplification, as - Clarice reacts, drops to the floor, rolling sideways, and -
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE "HOSTAGE"
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: pulls a revolver out from behind her back, still in SLOW MOTION, raising it in her untied hands.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She fires repeatedly, flames leaping from the muzzle; the SOUND is an echoing roar in these close quarters, but -
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice has come up on one knee, beside an armchair, and is already firing back herself, two quick SHOTS, which send -
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE "HOSTAGE"
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: pitching over the bed, backwards, to shudder and lie still in a haze of gunsmoke.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice rushes to her, clamping one knee down on her gun hand, still keeping her covered in case of movement.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: HOLD for a few beats... then we hear the shrill blast of a WHISTLE from somewhere, off screen, as normal ACTION and SOUND are restored.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRIGHAM (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: Okay, people, good exercise...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice relaxes, lowering her gun.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The lights brighten.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: PULLING BACK
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: we see that we're in some sort of auditorium, with the "hotel room" and its "corridor" built as a training set.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: JOHN BRIGHAM walks onto this set, thumbing a stopwatch.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mid-40's, ex- Marine.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His T-shirt's lettering says "Firearms Instructor / FBI Academy."
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRIGHAM
{DIALOGUE}: Starling's reaction time was excellent.
{DIALOGUE}: Let's break.
{DIALOGUE}: Critique in five.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A class of about forty young FBI trainees, of both sexes, begins to rise from their seats, mingling and chatting.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice nods amiably to the "Suspect", then gives her "Hostage" a hand up.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's ARDELIA MAPP, her roommate.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her broad, clever face breaks into a big smile, as they both remove ear plugs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice's voice has just a soft trace of southern accent.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARDELIA
{DIALOGUE}: Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{META_DATA}: (indicating her gun)
{DIALOGUE}: Never cock.
{DIALOGUE}: Just squeeze.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARDELIA
{META_DATA}: (grins)
{DIALOGUE}: I love it when you talk dirty.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Brigham joins them, Clarice can't resist a star pupil's little smile of pride.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He frowns good-naturedly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRIGHAM
{DIALOGUE}: What're you laughin' at, Junior G- Man?
{DIALOGUE}: She got off four rounds to your two.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes out a steel-coiled grip flexer, drops it onto her palm.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRIGHAM
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: One hundred reps, each hand, every day.
{DIALOGUE}: Now tidy up, the Section Chief wants to see you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He nods a direction, then moves off.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice, with her smile finally fading, looks out into the auditorium.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SPECIAL AGENT JACK CRAWFORD
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: sits on the top step of the aisle, looking down at her.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is 53, strongly built.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He rises impassively, exits through the back door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He carries a think manila envelope under one arm.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ardelia who is helping Clarice unbuckle her bullet-proof vest, follows her worried gaze.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: What'd I do?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARDELIA
{DIALOGUE}: Stay cool.
{DIALOGUE}: Just remember to call him "God."
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. FBI ACADEMY GROUNDS, QUANTICO, VIRGINIA - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Crawford is watching a group of trainees on the firing range, as Clarice joins him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks tired, haunted.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Between master and student, we sense a subtle, muted tug of sexuality.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Your instructors tell me you're doing well.
{DIALOGUE}: Top quarter of the class.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: I hope so.
{DIALOGUE}: They haven't posted anything.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: A job's come up and I thought about you.
{DIALOGUE}: Not really a job, more of - an interesting errand.
{DIALOGUE}: Walk me to my car, Starling.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They begin to cross the academy grounds.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A group of trainees jogs by, in matching sweats, following a p.e. coach.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile.
{DIALOGUE}: Could be a big help in unsolved cases.
{DIALOGUE}: Most of them have been happy to talk to us.
{DIALOGUE}: They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Not yet.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate.
{DIALOGUE}: I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Who's the subject?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice stops walking, goes very still.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: The cannibal...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Crawford doesn't respond, except to study her face.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, well... Okay, right.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: You're qualified and available.
{DIALOGUE}: And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He walks on again, at a faster clip.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She hurried to keep up.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: I don't expect him to talk to you, but I have to be able to say we tried... Lecter was a brilliant psychiatrist, and he knows all the dodges.
{META_DATA}: (hands her the manila envelope)
{DIALOGUE}: Dossier on him, copy of our questionnaire, special ID for you... If he won't talk, then I want straight reporting.
{DIALOGUE}: How's he look, how's his cell look, what's he writing?
{DIALOGUE}: The Director himself will see your report, over your own signature - if I decide it's good enough.
{DIALOGUE}: I want that by 0800 Wednesday, and keep this to yourself.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They're reached his car.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His driver stamps on a cigarette, climbs in behind the wheel.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: BURROUGHS, his assistant, says something into a walkie-talkie, then opens the back door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But Crawford pulls her aside, a hand on her shoulder.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His intensity is scary.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Now.
{DIALOGUE}: I want your full attention, Starling.
{DIALOGUE}: Are you listening to me?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Yes sir.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.
{DIALOGUE}: Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him.
{DIALOGUE}: Do not deviate from them, for any reason.
{DIALOGUE}: You tell him nothing personal, Starling.
{DIALOGUE}: Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{META_DATA}: (a bit unnerved)
{DIALOGUE}: And what is that, sir?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, he's a monster.
{DIALOGUE}: A pure psychopath...
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. CHILTON'S OFFICE - BALTIMORE STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLOSE ON an ID card held in a male hand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice's photo, official-looking graphics.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It calls her a "Federal Investigator."
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: It's so rare to capture one alive.
{DIALOGUE}: From a research point of view, Dr. Lecter is our most prized asset...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: DR. FREDERICK CHILTON looks up from her card.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A smarmy little peacock, behind a vast desk; he's conceived an instant, hopeless letch for Clarice.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He smiles, stroking her card with his beloved gold pen.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON
{DIALOGUE}: You know, we get a lot of detectives here, but I must say, I can't ever remember one so attractive...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: NEW ANGLE - REVEALS CLARICE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: now wearing a more feminine skirt suit.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hair neatly coiled, elegant shoulder bag, briefcase.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He has rudely left her standing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON
{DIALOGUE}: Will you be in Baltimore overnight...?
{DIALOGUE}: Because this can be quite a fun town, if you have the right guide.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice tries, unsuccessfully, to hide her distaste for him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON
{META_DATA}: (pause, sourly)
{DIALOGUE}: I see.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Let's make this quick, then.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm busy.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ASYLUM CORRIDOR - UPPER FLOOR - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice flinches as a heavy steel gate CLANGS shut behind her, the bolt shooting home.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chilton walks ahead of her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON
{DIALOGUE}: Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits.
{DIALOGUE}: We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests.
{DIALOGUE}: And my, does he hate us!
{DIALOGUE}: Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he?
{DIALOGUE}: Using you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON
{DIALOGUE}: A pretty young woman, to turn him on?
{DIALOGUE}: I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years.
{DIALOGUE}: And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor.
{DIALOGUE}: It's not a charm school.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON
{DIALOGUE}: Good.
{DIALOGUE}: Then you should be able to remember the rules.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. DIFFERENT CORRIDOR - LOWER FLOOR - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A darker, even grimmer area.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Heavy grids over the lights.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Distant SLAMMINGS and faint, hoarse SHOUTS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They walk briskly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON
{DIALOGUE}: Do not reach through the bars, do not touch the bars.
{DIALOGUE}: You pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils.
{DIALOGUE}: No staples or paperclips in his paper.
{DIALOGUE}: Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions.
{DIALOGUE}: Do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you.
{DIALOGUE}: Do you understand me?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: I understand.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON
{DIALOGUE}: I'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions... On the afternoon of July 8, 1981, he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary.
{DIALOGUE}: His mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an EKG.
{DIALOGUE}: When the nurse bent over him, he did this to her...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He hands Clarice a small, dog-eared photo.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Looking at it, she is stopped in her tracks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This pleases Chilton.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON
{DIALOGUE}: The doctors managed to re-set her jaw, more or less, and save one of her eyes.
{DIALOGUE}: His pulse never got over eighty-five, even when he ate her tongue.
{META_DATA}: (pauses, he smiles)
{DIALOGUE}: I keep him in here.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns, pushes a button.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A steel door BUZZES slowly open, and BARNEY - a big, impassive orderly - awaits them in an anteroom.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On its walls: restraints, mouthpieces, Mace, tranquilizer guns.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{META_DATA}: (quickly blocking him)
{DIALOGUE}: Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself.
{DIALOGUE}: What do you think?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON
{META_DATA}: (annoyed)
{DIALOGUE}: You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She holds out the photo.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He grabs it, jaw twitching.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON
{DIALOGUE}: When she's finished, bring her out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns on his heel, goes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Barney smiles reassuringly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BARNEY
{DIALOGUE}: Hi, I'm Barney.
{DIALOGUE}: He told you, don't get near the bars?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{META_DATA}: (shaking his hand)
{DIALOGUE}: Clarice Starling.
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, he did.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BARNEY
{DIALOGUE}: Okay.
{DIALOGUE}: Past the others, it's the last cell.
{DIALOGUE}: Stay to the middle.
{DIALOGUE}: I put out a chair for you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sensing her tension, he indicates a nearby security monitor.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BARNEY
{DIALOGUE}: I'm watching.
{DIALOGUE}: You'll do fine.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice nods gratefully.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She looks down the long corridor, takes a deep breath, walks into it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He watches her go.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. DR. LECTER'S CORRIDOR - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MOVING SHOT - with Clarice, as her footsteps ECHO.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: High to her right, surveillance cameras.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On her left, cells.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Some are padded, with narrow observation slits, others are normal, barred... Shadowy occupants pacing, MUTTERING... Suddenly a dark figure in the next-to-last cell hurtles towards her, his face mashing grotesquely against his bars as he hisses.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DARK FIGURE
{DIALOGUE}: I c-can sssmell your cunt!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice flinches momentarily, but then walks on.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: DR. LECTER'S CELL
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: is coming slowly INTO VIEW... Behind its barred front wall is a second barrier of stout nylon net... Sparse, bolted- down furniture, many softcover books and papers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On the walls, extraordinarily detailed, skillful drawings, mostly European cityscapes, in charcoal or crayon.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice stops, at a polite distance from his bars, clears her throat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Dr. Lecter... My name is Clarice Starling.
{DIALOGUE}: May I talk with you?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dr. Hannibal Lecter is lounging on his bunk, in white pajamas, reading an Italian Vogue.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns, considers her... A face so long out of the sun, it seems almost leached - except for the glittering eyes, and the wet red mouth.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He rises smoothly, crossing to stand before her; the gracious host.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His voice is cultured, soft.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Good morning.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CUTTING BETWEEN THEM
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as Clarice comes a measured distance closer.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling.
{DIALOGUE}: I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: "We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico.
{DIALOGUE}: You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: I am, yes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: May I see your credentials?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice is surprised, but fishes her ID card from her bag, holds it up for his inspection.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He smiles, soothingly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Closer, please... Clo-ser...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She complies each time, trying to hide her fear.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dr. Lecter's nostrils lift, as he gently, like an animal, tests the air.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he smiles, glancing at her card.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: That expires in one week.
{DIALOGUE}: You're not real FBI, are you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: I'm - still in training at the Academy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau.
{DIALOGUE}: Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling.
{DIALOGUE}: Sit.
{DIALOGUE}: Please.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She sits in the folding metal desk-chair.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He waits politely till she's settled, then sits down himself, faces her happily.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Now then.
{DIALOGUE}: What did Miggs say to you?
{META_DATA}: (she is puzzled)
{DIALOGUE}: "Multiple Miggs," in the next cell.
{DIALOGUE}: He hissed at you.
{DIALOGUE}: What did he say?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: He said - "I can smell your cunt."
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: I see.
{DIALOGUE}: I myself cannot.
{DIALOGUE}: You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today.
{DIALOGUE}: You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: It's much better than your shoes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe they'll catch up.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: I have no doubt of it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{META_DATA}: (shifting uncomfortably)
{DIALOGUE}: Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{DIALOGUE}: That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere.
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know Florence?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: All that detail, just from memory...?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Memory, Officer Starling, is what I have instead of view.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A pause, then Clarice takes the questionnaire from her case.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: No, no, no.
{DIALOGUE}: You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire.
{DIALOGUE}: It won't do.
{DIALOGUE}: It's stupid and boring.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor.
{DIALOGUE}: Either you will or you won't.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body.
{DIALOGUE}: Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy!
{DIALOGUE}: Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: No, I came because we need -
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: How many women has he used, our Bill?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Five... so far.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: All flayed...?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Partially, yes.
{DIALOGUE}: But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved.
{DIALOGUE}: If -
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill?
{DIALOGUE}: Tell me.
{DIALOGUE}: The newspapers won't say.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.
{META_DATA}: (he considers, then nods)
{DIALOGUE}: It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide.
{DIALOGUE}: They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Witless and misleading.
{DIALOGUE}: Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling?
{DIALOGUE}: Thrill me with your wisdom.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: It excites him.
{DIALOGUE}: Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: You ate yours.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A tense beat, then a smile from him, at this small boldness.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Send that through.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She rolls him the questionnaire, in his sliding food tray.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He rises, glances at it, turning a page or two disdainfully.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: I only hoped that your knowledge -
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly he whips the tray back at her, with a metallic CLANG that makes her start.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His voice remains a pleasant purr.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: You're sooo ambitious, aren't you...?
{DIALOGUE}: You know what you look like to me, with your good bag and your cheap shoes?
{DIALOGUE}: You look like a rube.
{DIALOGUE}: A well- scrubbed, hustling rube with a little, taste... Good nutrition has given you some length of bone, but you're not more than one generation from poor white trash, are you Officer Starling...?
{DIALOGUE}: That accent you're trying so desperately to shed - pure West Virginia.
{DIALOGUE}: What was your father, dear?
{DIALOGUE}: Was he a coal miner?
{DIALOGUE}: Did he stink of the lamp...?
{DIALOGUE}: And oh, how quickly the boys found you!
{DIALOGUE}: All those tedious, sticky fumblings, in the back seats of cars, while you could only dream of getting out.
{DIALOGUE}: Getting anywhere - yes?
{DIALOGUE}: Getting all the way - to the F..
{DIALOGUE}: B..
{DIALOGUE}: I.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His every word has struck her like a tiny, precise dart.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But she squares her jaw and won't give ground.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: You see a lot, Dr. Lecter.
{DIALOGUE}: But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself?
{DIALOGUE}: How about it...?
{DIALOGUE}: Look at yourself and write down the truth.
{META_DATA}: (she slams the tray back at him)
{DIALOGUE}: Or maybe you're afraid to.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: You're a tough one, aren't you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Reasonably so.
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: And you'd hate to think you were common.
{DIALOGUE}: My, wouldn't that sting!
{DIALOGUE}: Well you're far from common, Officer Starling.
{DIALOGUE}: All you have is the fear of it.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Now please excuse me.
{DIALOGUE}: Good day.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: And the questionnaire...?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: A census taker once tried to test me.
{DIALOGUE}: I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He steps backwards, then returns to his cot, becoming as still and remote as a statue.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Frustrated, Clarice hesitates, then finally shoulders her bag and goes, leaving the questionnaire in his tray.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But after just a few steps, as she passes -
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MIGG'S CELL
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She sees that creature at his bars again, hissing at her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MIGGS
{DIALOGUE}: I b-bit my wrist so I c-can diiiieeee!
{DIALOGUE}: S-ee how it bleeeeeeeeds?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The dark figure suddenly flings his palm towards her, and -
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLARICE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: is spattered on the face and neck - not with blood, but with pale droplets of semen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She gives a little cry, touching her fingers to the wetness.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Stunned, near tears, she forces herself to straighten up and walk on, fumbling for a tissue.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: From behind her, Dr. Lecter calls out, very agitated.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: Officer Starling... Officer Starling!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice slows, stops.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She shudders, but makes the very difficult choice to turn, walk back, stand again in front of -
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: DR. LECTER
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Who's shivering with rage.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For an instant his face opens, and we catch a glimpse into hell itself.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he's composed again.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: I would not have had that happen to you.
{DIALOGUE}: Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Then please - do this test for me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: No.

{DIALOGUE}: Advancement, of course.

{DIALOGUE}: See Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine.
{DIALOGUE}: M-O-F-E-T... Now go.
{DIALOGUE}: Go.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The grim gothic pile of the asylum looms overhead as Clarice rushes out the front doors.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: an old Pinto, parked nearby.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This image begins to BLUR...

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She is seeing, in her mind's eye -
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: IN FLASHBACK
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: a screen door banging open, on a wooden porch, and a 10-year old girl - the young Clarice - rushing outside, down the front steps, and running joyfully across her front yard to -
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MOVING ANGLE - THE GIRL'S POV
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: a car - late 60's vintage - parked in the dirt road.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A MAN, Clarice's father, is just climbing out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's tall, handsome, and has a marshal's badge pinned on his dark suit.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He grins, seeing her, and spreads his arms wide as...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE YOUNG CLARICE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: rushes into them, and he sweeps her up in a hug, spinning her around, the CAMERA SPINNING with them, and capturing both their laughing faces, before we abruptly return to -
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE ADULT CLARICE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: alone in the parking lot, sagging against her car.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her face is buried in her arms, she shoulders shaking.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. FBI ACADEMY FIRING RANGE - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice, in a combat stance, and wearing a sound-muffling headset, is squeezing off ROUND after ROUND at
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A MOVING TARGET
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The silhouette of a man, approaching along a track.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her shots, tightly grouped, are all finding the center chest.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The target stops, quite close to her, still swaying.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice stares at it, deftly working her speedloader.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then she puts a final, emphatic shot right through THE FIGURE'S FOREHEAD.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. FBI ACADEMY LIBRARY - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLOSE ON a microfilm monitor - a grainy newsphoto of Dr. Lecter, scrawling past, with an accompanying story ("New Horrors in Cannibal Trial"), dated 1980.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice is punching keys on the terminal.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Other trainees study at nearby tables.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She pauses, jotting a note on her pad, as Ardelia comes by, carrying an armful of books.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARDELIA
{DIALOGUE}: Phone call, Clarice.
{DIALOGUE}: It's God.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Thanks, Ardelia.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MOVING ANGLE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as Clarice rises, grabbing her notebook, and follows Ardelia past high metal bookstacks.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARDELIA
{DIALOGUE}: You missed Fourth Amendment law.
{DIALOGUE}: Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff.
{DIALOGUE}: Where were you all afternoon?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ardelia stares at her, figures it's a put-on, laughs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARDELIA
{DIALOGUE}: Damn.
{DIALOGUE}: Wish I had time for a social life.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice grins, as Ardelia indicates a phone receiver resting on the check-out desk, then moves on.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice picks it up.

{DIALOGUE}: Mr. Crawford?
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. CRAWFORD'S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Crawford, in a cardigan, sits in a wing chair in the book- lined study of his suburban home.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns the pages of Clarice's memo as they talk.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His tone is sharp.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: I've read your interim memo on Lecter.
{DIALOGUE}: You sure you've left nothing out?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INTERCUTTING
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Every word, Starling?
{DIALOGUE}: Every gesture?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{META_DATA}: (a bit heatedly)
{DIALOGUE}: Right down to the kleenex I used.
{META_DATA}: (he is silent)
{DIALOGUE}: Sir, why?
{DIALOGUE}: Is something wrong?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: He mentioned a name, at the very end.
{DIALOGUE}: "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: I spent all evening on the mainframe.
{DIALOGUE}: Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture.
{DIALOGUE}: No record of anyone named Mofet.
{DIALOGUE}: But "Split City" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce.
{DIALOGUE}: I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.
{META_DATA}: (glancing at her notes)
{DIALOGUE}: It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She pauses, expecting some soft of approval for her cleverness.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Well?
{DIALOGUE}: Why aren't you there right now?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Sir, that's a field job.
{DIALOGUE}: It's outside the scope of my assignment.
{DIALOGUE}: And I've got a test tomorrow on -
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling?
{DIALOGUE}: What were they?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday.
{DIALOGUE}: But sir -
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Then do that, Starling.
{DIALOGUE}: Do just exactly that.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Sir, what is it?
{DIALOGUE}: There's something you're not telling me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Miggs has been murdered.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{META_DATA}: (startled, upset)
{DIALOGUE}: Murdered...?
{DIALOGUE}: How?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying.
{DIALOGUE}: They found him at bed check.
{DIALOGUE}: He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you.
{DIALOGUE}: I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Starling...?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: You don't have to feel any way about it.
{DIALOGUE}: Lecter did it to amuse himself.
{DIALOGUE}: Why not, what can they do?
{DIALOGUE}: Take away his books for awhile, and no jello...
{META_DATA}: (a bit softer)
{DIALOGUE}: I know it got ugly today.
{DIALOGUE}: But this is your report, Starling - take it as far as you can.
{DIALOGUE}: On your own time, outside of class.
{DIALOGUE}: Now carry on.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ANGLE ON CLARICE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as we hear the loud CLICK of Crawford hanging up.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She stares at her receiver, stung by his abruptness.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Well God damn it!
{DIALOGUE}: You old creep.
{DIALOGUE}: Creepo son of a bitch.
{DIALOGUE}: Let Miggs squirt you and see how you like it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She slams her receiver into its cradle.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ANGLE ON CRAWFORD
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as he flips aside her memo, then rises, wearily.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He leaves his study, flicking off the lamp, and pads away in his slippers.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. CRAWFORD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A private nurse, in white, stands marking a clipboard chart, as Crawford enters his tidy bedroom.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: I'll take over, Patricia.
{DIALOGUE}: You get some rest.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The nurse nods, hands him the chart, and goes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He glances at it, then sets it aside.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He crosses to -
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: BELLA CRAWFORD
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: who lies in an elevated hospital bed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Nearby are an oxygen tank and mask, floral arrangements.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her breathing is shallow, very labored.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Crawford looks down at his comatose wife for a long moment, tenderly brushes a strand of her hair back into place, then bends over to kiss her forehead.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SOUND UPCUT - THUNDER and RAIN...
{META_DATA}: DISSOLVE TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. "SPLIT CITY MINI-STORAGE" - DUSK (RAINING)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An orange neon sign, streaked with rain, identifies out location.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It looms over a hurricane fence, topped with barbed wire.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Inside, row on row of garage-sized, cinderblock sheds.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. YOW (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Unit 31 was leased for ten years.
{DIALOGUE}: Pre-paid in full... The contract is in the name of "Miss Hester Mofet."
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. STORAGE UNIT NUMBER 31 - DUSK
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice, kneeling before a closed, roll-up metal door, takes a FLASH photo of its sealed padlock.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: EVERETT YOW, a fat, 60ish Chinaman, holds an umbrella over them both.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks unhappy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: So no one's been in here since - 1980?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She opens the padlock, using a fat ring of tagged keys, then sets aside both keys and lock.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. YOW
{DIALOGUE}: Not to my knowledge.
{DIALOGUE}: Privacy is a great concern to my customers.
{DIALOGUE}: But, if you say this is an FBI matter...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise.
{DIALOGUE}: Be gone before you know it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Slinging her camera over a shoulder, she tugs at the handle, but the door won't budge.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Another tug, harder - no good.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mr. Yow stoops to help, puffing hard, but it's firmly stuck.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He sighs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. YOW
{DIALOGUE}: We could return tomorrow, with my son.
{DIALOGUE}: Or perhaps some workmen...?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice crosses to her Pinto, which faces the shed, reaches in to turn on her headlights.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mr. Yow blinks in the sudden brightness.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then she opens her truck, rummaging inside, and returns with a bumper jack, a flashlight, and a rubber floor mat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Would you hold these, please?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She gives him her flashlight and camera, drops the mat on the ground, then sets the bumper jack in place, under the center of the door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She pumps on the jack handle as the door SQUEALS slowly up, but it won't go higher than about 18 inches, despite all her exertions.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She spreads out the rubber mat on the cement, takes the flashlight from Mr. Yow, then lies on the mat.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. THE STORAGE SHED - DUSK (VERY DARK)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice, backlit, peers under the door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She reaches in, makes a sweep with her flashlight.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We catch shadowy outlines - boxes, then the flattened tires of a car...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SOUND of rain on the tin roof, and other noises, too - small RUSTLINGS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Mr. Yow's chubby face appears down beside Clarice's.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. YOW
{DIALOGUE}: It smells like mice... I think I hear them, too - don't you?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice turns onto her back, starts squirming under the door.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. YOW
{DIALOGUE}: You're going in there?
{META_DATA}: CUT BACK TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. STORAGE UNIT NUMBER 31 - DUSK
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice pulls her head back out again, reaching to take her camera from him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She hands him a card, trying to appear nonchalant.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha!
{DIALOGUE}: - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number?
{DIALOGUE}: It's our Baltimore field office.
{DIALOGUE}: They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. YOW
{DIALOGUE}: Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks?
{DIALOGUE}: To prevent mouse intrusion.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Good idea.
{META_DATA}: CUT BACK TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. STORAGE SHED - DUSK (VERY DARK)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice squirms, on her back, through the narrow opening.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As she squeezes all the way in, she snags one thigh on the metal edge of the door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She curses softly, shining her flashlight on her ripped khakis - there's a small streak of blood.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. YOW (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: Okay, Miss Starling?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Okay, Mr. Yow...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She shines her light around.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In its narrow beam, we see -
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLARICE'S POV - UPWARD, SHIFTING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: spiderwebs, everywhere... high stacks of cardboard boxes... a few dusty pieces of furniture... the big car, oddly long and tall, covered with a tarp... Suddenly there's a scurrying of loud MUSICAL NOTES.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice turns, scared, her beam capturing... an old upright piano.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. YOW (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: That wasn't me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. YOW (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: Oh.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice crawls a bit further.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There's hardly room to stand, but she finally manages to wriggle upright, clawing away cobwebs, next to the car.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Holding her light under one arm, she takes several FLASH photos of the shed's interior, ending with the car.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, slinging her camera over the shoulder, she folds back the tarp, resting it on the roof.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The resulting clouds of dust make her cough.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE CAR
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: is an antique beauty, a 1931 Packard.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's very dusty, despite the tarp.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Curtains close off the back passenger compartment, but there's a narrow gap in them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: More mousy RUSTLINGS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLARICE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: peers in through the gap, aiming her flashlight.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: HER POV - SHIFTING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as the thin flashlight beam picks out: the broad back seat... as open album of lacy, old-fashioned Valentines... a crumpled lap rug, on the floor... and then a pair of women's shiny, high-heeled pumps... Above these, the hem of a fancy satin evening gown - and a pair of pale, stockinged legs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice recoils, alarmed, then steadies herself.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Mr. Yow?
{DIALOGUE}: Oh Mr. Yow...?
{DIALOGUE}: It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. YOW (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: Oh my!
{DIALOGUE}: Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Not yet!
{DIALOGUE}: - just wait for me.
{META_DATA}: (under the breath)
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe in about two seconds.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She leans down with her camera, takes a FLASH through the gap, then tries the door handle.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Locked.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: So is the front door.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She looks around, aiming her light, and locates a tangle of coat-hangers, sticking out of a carton of bric-a-brac.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She pulls out one of these, straightens it quickly, bends the tip into a hook.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLOSE ANGLE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as she jams this tool inside the join at the top of the back passenger window, then fishes around till she can snag the inside door latch, pulling up.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A satisfying CLICK.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice opens the door - it hits stacked boxes, and won't open far - then very cautiously leans inside, aiming her flashlight.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: HER POV - MOVING LIGHT BEAM
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: revealing more of the evening gown... a pair of hands, in white, elbow-length gloves - one rests on the lap, the other atop a large, beaded, drawstring evening bag... thick strands of costume pearls over the breasts... and finally the white neck stub of a female mannequin.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: No face or head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLARICE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: sighs with relief.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She takes a couple more FLASHES, then very carefully lifts out the Valentine album, holding it by the corners, and setting it atop the car.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then she eases herself inside, onto the back seat, as the springs SQUEAK loudly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ONE GLOVED HAND slides off the lap, brushing Clarice's thigh.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice starts a bit, then pokes at the gloved arm, hard.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She peels back a bit of glove, revealing the white, synthetic elbow.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She smiles, shaking her head at her own jumpiness, as she reaches over the mannequin's lap to loosen the evening bag's drawstring.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A SEVERED HUMAN HEAD stares back at her, as the beaded material slides away.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice lurches back, gasping loudly, and several long, heart- pounding moments pass before she can make herself look more closely.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The head bobs gently in a pool of alcohol, in a laboratory specimen jar.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is a man's head, but grotesquely transformed, by the addition of heavy makeup, earrings, and a sodden wig, into a woman's face.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Over the years the makeup has smeared badly, and the pupils have gone almost milky white.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLARICE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: staring at this terrible thing, is pleased to find herself quickly regaining control.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She murmurs to herself.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Well, Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. QUINN'S HOSPITAL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT (RAINING)

{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. DR. LECTER'S CELL AND CORRIDOR - NIGHT (DIM LIGHT)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On a noiseless TV screen, an evangelist rants, waving his arms.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Behind him, a swaying choir in gaudy robes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: It's an anagram, isn't it, Doctor?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: PAN TO Clarice, with her wet hair plastered flat, sitting on the corridor floor to one side of this TV, which has been stationed so that Dr. Lecter cannot avoid seeing it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Hester Mofet... "The rest of me."
{DIALOGUE}: Miss The-Rest-of-Me... Meaning, you rented that place.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: HER POV
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: he's lost in shadows; we can't see him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He doesn't respond.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CUTTING BETWEEN THEM
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice and the darkened call - as she tries again.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: You put those - things in there.
{DIALOGUE}: Paid for it in advance, ten years ago... Why, Dr. Lecter?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The food carrier suddenly SWISHES out of the cell, making her jump up.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In its tray is a clean, folded white towel.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She hesitates, then crosses, takes this.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Thank you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She sits again, rubbing her wet hair.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When he finally speaks, he's on the floor, too - a deeper, hunching darkness in the shadows, occasionally striped by the flickering TV light.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Your bleeding has stopped.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: How did -
{META_DATA}: (she stops herself)
{DIALOGUE}: It's nothing.
{DIALOGUE}: A scratch.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{META_DATA}: (surprised, a beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Why?
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know something about him?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: I might if I saw the case file.
{DIALOGUE}: You could get that for me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?"
{DIALOGUE}: You wanted me to find him.
{DIALOGUE}: Or do I have to wait for the lab?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{META_DATA}: (sighs)
{DIALOGUE}: His real name is Benjamin Raspail.
{DIALOGUE}: A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...?
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away.
{DIALOGUE}: Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments.
{DIALOGUE}: You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: If you didn't kill him, then who did?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Who can say...?
{DIALOGUE}: Best thing for him, really.
{DIALOGUE}: His therapy was going nowhere.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: And have them clomping about in my life?
{DIALOGUE}: Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice?
{DIALOGUE}: May I call you Clarice?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Scared, at first.
{DIALOGUE}: Then - exhilarated.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Ahhh... Why?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Because you weren't wasting my time.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage?
{DIALOGUE}: Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{DIALOGUE}: Next time I'll have to check.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he?
{DIALOGUE}: Apparently he likes you.
{DIALOGUE}: And you like him, too.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: I never thought about it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Your first lie to me, Clarice.
{DIALOGUE}: How sad.
{DIALOGUE}: Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually?
{DIALOGUE}: True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...?
{DIALOGUE}: Fucking you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: That doesn't interest me, Doctor.
{DIALOGUE}: And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Not anymore.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice.
{DIALOGUE}: Crawford dangles you before me.
{DIALOGUE}: Then I give you a bit of help.
{DIALOGUE}: Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{DIALOGUE}: Is it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of... negotiation?
{DIALOGUE}: There's something Crawford can give me, and I want to trade for it.
{DIALOGUE}: I even wrote to him, offering my help.
{DIALOGUE}: But he hates me, so he won't deal directly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dr. Lecter slowly turns up the rheostat in his cell.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As his lights rise, we see that the cell's been stripped bare.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gone are his books, drawings, mattress - even his toilet seat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She stands, too, startled.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They face each other.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Punishment, you see.
{DIALOGUE}: For Miggs.
{DIALOGUE}: Just like that gospel program.
{DIALOGUE}: When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up.
{DIALOGUE}: Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Who killed Raspail, Doctor...?
{DIALOGUE}: You know, don't you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice.
{DIALOGUE}: I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive.
{DIALOGUE}: What I want is a view.
{DIALOGUE}: I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water.
{DIALOGUE}: I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll give good value for it.
{DIALOGUE}: Crawford could do that for me, but he won't.
{DIALOGUE}: You persuade him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{META_DATA}: (almost a whisper)
{DIALOGUE}: Who killed your patient?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, a very naughty boy.
{DIALOGUE}: Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Buffalo Bill...?
{META_DATA}: (incredulous)
{DIALOGUE}: Bill killed him, all those years ago...?
{DIALOGUE}: That's impossible.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But Dr. Lecter only smiles, enigmatically.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Who is he stalking right now, Clarice?
{DIALOGUE}: I wonder, don't you?
{DIALOGUE}: How many more young women will have to die, before you trade with me...?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Clarice stares at him, unsure how to respond -
{META_DATA}: DISSOLVE TO:

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A MAN
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: standing at the open rear door of a brown panel truck.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His right forearm is in a cast and sling; he is struggling, unsuccessfully, to hoist an armchair into the truck.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Parked nearby, other cars, RVs, a boat on a trailer.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A thin, breast- high fog fills the lot; arc lights make yellow pools.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Catherine hesitates, then crosses towards the man.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CATHERINE
{DIALOGUE}: Help you with that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAN
{DIALOGUE}: Would you?
{DIALOGUE}: Thanks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His voice is odd, strained, very soft.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A fog lamp, set on end on the ground, distorts his features from below.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We can't get a good glimpse of his face, but his body is plump, above average height; he's in his mid 30's.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She sets down the bag, then together they easily lift the chair into the truck.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAN (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: Let's slide it up, you mind?
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. THE PANEL TRUCK - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He climbs inside the truck, ducking under a small hand winch, and grabs the chair.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She hesitates again, but climbs in after him; together they slide the chair forward, behind the seats.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAN
{DIALOGUE}: Are you about a size 14?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CATHERINE
{META_DATA}: (surprised)
{DIALOGUE}: What?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly, in the shadowy dark, he clubs her over the back of her head with his cast.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She moans, slumps unconscious, sliding off the armchair to lie on her stomach.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pulls off his cast and sling, tosses them aside, then hops out of the truck, grabs his lamp, climbs back inside, and pulls the door shut.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He bends over her face with the lamp.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We hear her shallow BREATHING.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAN
{DIALOGUE}: Good.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He peels back the collar of her blouse, reading the size tag.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAN
{DIALOGUE}: Good.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He carefully slits her blouse up the back, with a pair of bandage scissors, peeling apart the two halves.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There's no bra strap.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He strokes her bare skin delicately, very happily.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MAN
{DIALOGUE}: Gooood...
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. THE PARKING LOT - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: LOW ANGLE - CLOSE - on Catherine's grocery bag, as her blouse is tossed out beside it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SOUND of the truck's motor starting.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The truck backs up, one rear wheel knocking over the bag, partly squashing it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then is drives away, taillights shrinking, as a lone orange rolls slowly away from the bag...
{META_DATA}: DISSOLVE TO:

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLOSE ON a large video screen, where a BLURRY image gradually sharpens, resolving into two separate pieces of fabric.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: INSTRUCTOR (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: Electron microscopy reveals fiber "signatures" that are nearly as distinct as fingerprints...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice sits at a long table, with other trainees.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ardelia is beside her.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Other tables and students in the background.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Each trainee has his own microscope.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice is tired, but straightens, hearing -
{CHARACTER_NAME}: INSTRUCTOR (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: Both of these blouses were worn by victims of Buffalo Bill.
{DIALOGUE}: They were found in two different states, and four months apart.
{DIALOGUE}: He always slits them up the back, like a funeral suit...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ON THE SCREEN
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: successively CLOSER VIEWS of the cut fabric edges, until we are seeing individual threads, big as tree limbs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The cuts match.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: INSTRUCTOR (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: The bunching you see - this compression - is characteristic of scissor cuts, rather than a single blade.
{DIALOGUE}: And, as you see - Bill always uses the same pair...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ANGLE ON THE DOOR
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as John Brigham, the gunnery instructor, sticks his head in.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRIGHAM
{DIALOGUE}: Clarice Starling!
{DIALOGUE}: Are you in here?

{DIALOGUE}: Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight.
{DIALOGUE}: You're goin' with Crawford.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Where?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRIGHAM
{DIALOGUE}: Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body.
{DIALOGUE}: It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation.
{DIALOGUE}: Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater.
{DIALOGUE}: Think you can handle it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{META_DATA}: (thinking quickly)
{DIALOGUE}: I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. BRIGHAM'S JEEP CHEROKEE - DAY (DRIVING)

{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRIGHAM
{DIALOGUE}: Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he?
{DIALOGUE}: Impatient...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Sometimes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRIGHAM
{DIALOGUE}: He's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is real sick.
{DIALOGUE}: Comatose... I'm tellin' you about it now, 'cause he may never.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice absorbs this in silence as they stop near an ancient, rather dilapidated Beechcraft.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Its door is open, the twin props and beacons already turning.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Brigham turns to her, holding out his small canvas bag.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRIGHAM
{DIALOGUE}: You're goin' in the field, so you gotta have full kit.
{DIALOGUE}: Take this - it's my own...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice opens the bag, stares at the big blue gun nestled in its shoulder holster.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She looks up at him, touched.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRIGHAM
{DIALOGUE}: Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse.
{DIALOGUE}: Dry fire it whenever you get the chance.
{DIALOGUE}: And do your exercises.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: I will... I promise.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRIGHAM
{DIALOGUE}: Listen, I hope you never need a thing I've taught you.
{DIALOGUE}: But you've got something... Jack sees it, I do too.
{DIALOGUE}: If you ever need to, you can shoot.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She nods, climbs out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then she looks back in at him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They're both moved by this rite of passage, but a little embarrassed.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BRIGHAM
{DIALOGUE}: Bless you, Starling...
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. BEECHCRAFT PLANE - DAY (FLYING)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLARICE'S POV - Out the plane's window, at the landscape far below.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wisps of cloud, a quilt of farms.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice turns from the window, looks at a think folder in her lap.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The cover reads "Case File: / BUFFALO BILL."
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice is moody, distracted.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She hesitates, then opens the file, begins to scan.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: INSERTS - HER POV
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Police forms, some handwritten... Typed lab reports; we catch words, phrases: "Autopsy Protocols", "Histamine Analysis"... Grainy enlargements of bullet slugs, showing matched grooves... And then a stack of victim photos.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The first one, taken from a good distance away, shows a nude female body, face down on a pebbly riverbank, surrounded by bits of litter.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice hesitates again, then flips this photo to look at the next.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It makes her flinch, just slightly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Quickly she turns through several more photographs, trying hard to concentrate.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: He keeps them alive for three days.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: NEW ANGLE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: shows Crawford standing over her, swaying with the plane's motion.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Behind him, the open cockpit door, the pilot's back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Crawford sits, removing sunglasses.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He rubs his eyes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Why, we don't yet know... There's no evidence of rape or physical abuse prior to death.
{DIALOGUE}: All the mutilation you see there is post-mortem.
{META_DATA}: (a beat; he glances at her)
{DIALOGUE}: I'm hot, are you hot?
{DIALOGUE}: Bobby, it's too damned hot back here...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The pilot adjusts a valve.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Crawford turns to her again.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: So.
{DIALOGUE}: Three days.
{DIALOGUE}: Then he shoots them, skins them - usually just the torsos - and dumps them.
{DIALOGUE}: Each body in a different river, in a different state, downstream from an interstate highway.
{DIALOGUE}: The water leaves us no fingerprints, fibers, DNA fluids - no trace evidence at all.
{DIALOGUE}: That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A COLOR PHOTO - IN CLARICE'S HANDS
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: shows a pretty, plump-cheeked brunette, in her high school graduation cap and gown.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She smiles at us with touching optimism.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: A big girl, like all the rest.
{DIALOGUE}: Went about 160... Her corpse was the only one he took the trouble to weight down, so actually, she was the third girl found.
{DIALOGUE}: After her, he got lazy...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: NEW ANGLE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as Clarice stares at the girl's face, moved.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Crawford pulls a map from the file, spreads it out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It shows the central and eastern U.S., with widely-spaced, hand-drawn markings.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, where the Bimmel girl was abducted.
{DIALOGUE}: Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri.
{DIALOGUE}: Same marks for the other four girls, in different colors.
{DIALOGUE}: This new one, today... washed up here.
{META_DATA}: (he marks with a Flair pen)
{DIALOGUE}: Elk River, in West Virginia, about six miles below U.S. 79.
{DIALOGUE}: Real boonies.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?
{META_DATA}: (he shakes his head)
{DIALOGUE}: What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites?
{DIALOGUE}: Do they converge at all?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Good idea, but he thought of it, too.
{DIALOGUE}: We've run simulations, using different vectors and the best dates we can assign.
{DIALOGUE}: You put it all in the computer, and smoke comes out.
{DIALOGUE}: No, this one is different.
{DIALOGUE}: This one has seen us coming...
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY (DRIVING)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Crawford steers, following a highway patrol car along a winding mountain road.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice has the file open on her lap.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Talk about him, Starling.
{DIALOGUE}: Tell me what you see.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{META_DATA}: (choosing her words carefully)
{DIALOGUE}: He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group.
{DIALOGUE}: And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere.
{DIALOGUE}: Not an apartment.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Why?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control.
{DIALOGUE}: He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Why not?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: He's got a real taste for it now.
{DIALOGUE}: And he's getting better at his work.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{META_DATA}: (a beat; impressed)
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{META_DATA}: (quietly, evenly)
{DIALOGUE}: Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He studies her a few moments, measuring her anger.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Okay, Starling.
{DIALOGUE}: Let's have it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: You haven't said a word today about that garage.
{DIALOGUE}: Or what I found there.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: What should I say?
{DIALOGUE}: You did fine work.
{DIALOGUE}: We'll wait on the lab.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: You knew.
{DIALOGUE}: You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me.
{DIALOGUE}: You sent me in to him naked.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Are you finished?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head.
{DIALOGUE}: He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A shadow of regret passes over his face, but he answers sternly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Number One.
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe there's a connection, maybe not.
{DIALOGUE}: Lying and breathing are the same thing to Lecter.
{DIALOGUE}: Number Two.
{DIALOGUE}: If I'd sent you in there with something to hide from him, he'd have known it, instantly.
{DIALOGUE}: He'd never have trusted you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She starts to answer, then is silent.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is right.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: By now the two cars are entering a tidy little town - tree- lined streets, wooden houses, one-story shops, mountains in the background.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They slow, turn.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Number Three, I didn't bring you along today just because you can do first-rate forensics.
{DIALOGUE}: If Lecter is becoming part of this case, you've got the most current read on him.
{DIALOGUE}: And Number Four - you don't have to like me, or the way I do things.
{DIALOGUE}: But you do have to keep a cool head.
{DIALOGUE}: Especially now... Because from here on out, you'll know everything I do.
{DIALOGUE}: Are we straight on that?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice nods, silently; it's as close to an apology as she's likely to get.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She stares out the windshield.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: JUST AHEAD OF THEM
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: the highway patrol cruiser noses into a curb, next to other police cars, facing a big white frame house.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Its sign reads "Potter Funeral Home."
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Two troopers climb from the car.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Crawford parks too, then kills the engine.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns to her, removing his sunglasses, gestures to the case file.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{META_DATA}: (softly)
{DIALOGUE}: You think about him long enough, you get a feel for him... Then, if you're lucky, out of all the stuff you know, one little part of it tugs at you, tries to get your attention... You let me know when that happens, Starling.
{DIALOGUE}: Live right behind your eyes, today.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't try to impose any patterns on this guy.
{DIALOGUE}: Just stay open and let him show you...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: One of the troopers, impassive in his sunglasses and hat, peers in through Crawford's window.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Crawford nods to him, then turns back to Clarice.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: School's out, Starling.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. SIDEWALK OF THE FUNERAL HOME - POTTER, WEST VA. - DAY

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: COUNTRY PEOPLE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: in their somber best, filing into the mortuary for a service.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The music - "Shall We Gather At The River?"
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: - is issuing from the open double doors.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Several of the mourners glance over at her curiously.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ANGLE ON CLARICE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: staring back at the mourners, hearing the music, as a sense memory is triggered in her...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: IN FLASHBACK - LOW ANGLE, MOVING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as we approach, down the aisle of a country chapel, an open wooden coffin.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Sad country faces turn, looking at us from the flanking pews.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The b.g. organ hymn is "Shall We Gather...?"
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE SAD, 10 YEAR-OLD CLARICE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: in her best dress, is reluctantly approaching the casket.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her hands are held by the plump hands of unseen matrons.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. FUNERAL HOME - BACK CORRIDOR - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A young deputy, several state troopers, and a SHERIFF are all waiting, as Crawford and Clarice enter.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The dim, cluttered corridor doubles as storage space - there's a treadle sewing machine, a soft-drink machine, a tricycle.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The MUSIC is closer.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Crawford shakes hands with the sheriff.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Sheriff Perkins?
{DIALOGUE}: Jack Crawford, FBI... This is Officer Starling.
{DIALOGUE}: We appreciate your phoning us.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHERIFF
{META_DATA}: (grim, unsociable)
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't call you.
{DIALOGUE}: That was somebody from the state attorney's office... 'For you do a thing else, I'm gon' find out if this girl's local.
{DIALOGUE}: It could just be somethin' that outside elements has dumped on us.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He casts a sidelong, unhappy glance at Clarice.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Well sir, that's where we can help.
{DIALOGUE}: If -
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHERIFF
{DIALOGUE}: I don't even know you, Mister... Now we'll extend you ever courtesy, just soon as we can, but for right now -
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Sheriff, this, ah - this type of sex crime has some aspects I'd rather discuss just between the two of us.
{DIALOGUE}: Know what I mean?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He indicates Clarice with his eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The sheriff hesitates, nods, then lets Crawford guide him into a small office, closing the door behind them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Muffled WORDS from there.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLARICE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: burning at this slight, is left alone with the troopers, who peek at her with shy curiosity.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She pulls her blazer a bit tighter, self-conscious about her bulging shoulder holster.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ANGLE ON THE OFFICE DOOR
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as, after a few more moments, the sheriff and Crawford emerge.

{DIALOGUE}: Now please - go on out and let me take care of her... Go on, now.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The men look at one another, a little bashfully, then begin to to file out, whispering among themselves.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As they go, a bright green body bag is REVEALED, tightly zipped, lying on a porcelain embalming table.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is almost the only modern object in this Victorian room, with its glass-paned cabinets and faded wallpaper, decorated with cabbage roses.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: FAVORING CRAWFORD
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as he looks at Clarice with a new degree of respect.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She takes another FLASH, then quickly reloads film.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LAMAR
{DIALOGUE}: Them fishhooks are set too close together.
{DIALOGUE}: No wonder the Franklin boys was scared to say they found her.

{DIALOGUE}: What is it - some kind of seed pod?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LAMAR
{DIALOGUE}: Nawsir, that's a bug cocoon.
{DIALOGUE}: But how come that to get way down in there?

{DIALOGUE}: Cold'll make you feel better.
{DIALOGUE}: It does me.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She smiles, touched, and takes the can.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When Lamar sees Crawford coming outside, he tactfully departs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Crawford sits beside her; there's a brief silence.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She soothes herself with the can.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?
{META_DATA}: (she is silent)
{DIALOGUE}: That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him.
{DIALOGUE}: You did well in there.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are.
{DIALOGUE}: They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Point taken.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She looks at him a moment, then offers the can.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He opens it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it.
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect.
{DIALOGUE}: It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{META_DATA}: (shakes his head)
{DIALOGUE}: The other girls are in the ground.
{DIALOGUE}: Exhumations are upsetting for the families.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll do it if I have to, but -
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Then have the lab check Raspail's head.
{META_DATA}: (he looks at her)
{DIALOGUE}: Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: You seem pretty sure of that.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls.
{DIALOGUE}: And Lecter knows him.
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you?
{DIALOGUE}: Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks at her for a moment, then sips again.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Before we caught him, Lecter had a big psychiatric practice in Baltimore.
{DIALOGUE}: But he traveled all over the country - teaching, consulting... Christ, even testifying in murder trials.
{DIALOGUE}: Who knows how many potential psychos he turned loose, just for the fun of it...?

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She is standing on the cement bottom of the pit, or oubliette, about 15 feet below floor level.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The pit is bare, except for a futon and a plastic toilet bucket, from which a thin string rises up to the basement.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: CATHERINE
{DIALOGUE}: Mister, if you let me go, I won't press charges, I promise.
{DIALOGUE}: You've only had me here a couple days, and -
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. GUMB (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: Just one day...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CATHERINE
{DIALOGUE}: Is that all...?
{DIALOGUE}: See - see, my mom is a real important woman... Well, I guess you already know that.
{DIALOGUE}: She'll pay you, no questions asked.
{DIALOGUE}: Whatever cause you represent - Iran, Palestine - she'll see that -
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A sudden blinding glare of light silences her.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She looks up, shielding her eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: HER POV
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: a floodlamp is descending, attached to a small basket.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: MR. GUMB
{DIALOGUE}: Put the bottle in the basket.
{DIALOGUE}: No funny business, or you'll be sorry...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: NEW ANGLE - CATHERINE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as the basket stops, and she steadies it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But as she slips the bottle in, she sees something, O.S., just at the fringe of the light.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She hesitates, looks closer... then begins to scream, hysterically, again and again.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her outflung hand hits the lamp, and in its swaying glare, we see - high on the concrete walls, all around her -
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: BLOODY FINGER TRACKS

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The photo disappears, replaced by the TV ANCHOR himself.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TV ANCHOR
{DIALOGUE}: Memphis Police sources indicate that the missing girl's blouse has been identified, sliced up the back, in what has become a kind of grim calling card.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Other trainees are drifting into the rec room, some whispering among themselves.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice stares back at the TV intently.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TV ANCHOR (O.S.)

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: BACK ON THE TV ANCHOR
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TV ANCHOR
{DIALOGUE}: ...to its highest levels, the president himself being said to be, and I quote, "intensely concerned."

{CHARACTER_NAME}: SEN. MARTIN
{DIALOGUE}: I'm speaking now to the person who is holding my daughter.

{DIALOGUE}: She's very gentle and kind - talk to her and you'll see.
{DIALOGUE}: Her name is Catherine...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice is moved by what she sees.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Other trainees are all around her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{META_DATA}: (whispers)
{DIALOGUE}: Boy, is that smart...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ARDELIA
{DIALOGUE}: Why does she keep repeating the name?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Somebody's coaching her... They're trying to make him see Catherine as a person - not just an object.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ON THE TV AGAIN
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SEN. MARTIN
{DIALOGUE}: You have a chance to show the whole world that you can be merciful, as well as strong.
{DIALOGUE}: Please - I beg you - release my Catherine...

{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: I don't think he knew that she's a Senator's child.
{DIALOGUE}: She's a big girl, Starling, like all the rest.
{DIALOGUE}: We're going on the theory she was randomly targeted by size...
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. MUSEUM CORRIDOR - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice, now accompanied by a museum guard, walks through an eerie landscape of dinosaur bones - crouching skeletons with blank eye sockets, gaping fangs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: By now, Bill's had her for 36 hours.
{DIALOGUE}: That leaves us just 36 more, before he kills her... But maybe, just maybe, Starling, we caught a real break this time - thanks to you.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: We found another bug, in Raspail's head.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:

{DIALOGUE}: You lured him with produce.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WIDER ANGLE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: shows two entomologists, both 30ish, hunched over the board.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: RODEN is a pudgy redhead; PILCHER is lean, quite handsome.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RODEN
{DIALOGUE}: Tough noogies!
{DIALOGUE}: It's still my turn.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: If the beetle moves one of your men, does that count?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They look up, delighted to see Clarice in the doorway.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Both men are hopelessly smitten by her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RODEN
{DIALOGUE}: Of course it counts.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: RODEN
{DIALOGUE}: Where the hell did this one come from?
{DIALOGUE}: It's practically mush.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE

{CHARACTER_NAME}: PILCHER
{DIALOGUE}: Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RODEN
{DIALOGUE}: I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis!
{DIALOGUE}: Are you wearing a gun, right now?
{META_DATA}: (Clarice nods)
{DIALOGUE}: Ooh, cool!

{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. LABORATORY - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: VERY CLOSE (MAGNIFICATION) on the sliced cocoon, as Roden uses tweezers and a dental probe to ease out the sodden chrysalis.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RODEN (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: The whole trick is to remove the chrysalis without destroying it... The wings are just like wet tissue paper...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE TWO MEN
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: are hunched over a formica table, peering through square magnifiers into stainless trays.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice watches curiously.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Of their two specimens, Pilcher's moth is in much better condition - a big brown creature, its wings outspread on towel paper.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PILCHER
{META_DATA}: (without looking up)
{DIALOGUE}: What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE

{META_DATA}: (smiles)
{DIALOGUE}: Not lately.
{DIALOGUE}: But maybe someday.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She leans forward, intently.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: HER POV (MAGNIFICATION)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: the wide, furry, brown back of the moth.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And there, right between the wing bases - wonderful and terrible to see - is nature's perfect reproduction of a ghostly human skull.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RODEN (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PILCHER (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell.
{DIALOGUE}: Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time.
{DIALOGUE}: Didn't I read that?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: FAVORING CLARICE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as she looks up at him, awed, excited, almost trembling.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PILCHER
{META_DATA}: (shakes his head)
{DIALOGUE}: They live in Malaysia.
{DIALOGUE}: In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{META_DATA}: (pause, then softly)
{DIALOGUE}: Dr. Lecter...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As the two men stare at her, puzzled, we hear a SOUND UPCUT - the wail of police SIRENS - and...

{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. THE SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY (DRIVING)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The van is crammed with an impressive array of hi-tech equipment, all CLICKING and HUMMING.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Burroughs is talking quietly on a scrambler phone, while another agent works a computer.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe we can locate some of Raspail's old lovers.
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe, someday...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLARICE AND CRAWFORD
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: sit in swivel seats at the rear, by a big window.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice can't resit an occasional peak at the trailing motorcade, awed and a bit thrilled to be the center of so much attention.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter.
{DIALOGUE}: You're the one he talks to.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch.
{DIALOGUE}: That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off.
{DIALOGUE}: Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun.
{DIALOGUE}: Never forget fun.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: But if he knew we have so little time -
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait.
{DIALOGUE}: He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up.
{DIALOGUE}: That'd be the most fun of all.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: I think he means it, this time.
{DIALOGUE}: I think he'll deal.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: What would it take?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Transfer to a new prison.
{DIALOGUE}: With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{META_DATA}: (shakes his head)
{DIALOGUE}: State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time.
{DIALOGUE}: Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: You'll back me up with some paperwork?
{META_DATA}: (he nods)
{DIALOGUE}: Then I'll try.
{DIALOGUE}: But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{META_DATA}: (hesitates)
{DIALOGUE}: She doesn't know what we're up to.
{DIALOGUE}: And we can't afford to let her find out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice looks at him, surprised.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: She's the mother, Starling.
{DIALOGUE}: She can't possibly comprehend what Lecter is.
{DIALOGUE}: She'd make the mistake of pleading with him.
{DIALOGUE}: Begging him... He'd feast on her pain till the last second of that girl's life...

{DIALOGUE}: We can't trust Frederick Chilton, either.
{DIALOGUE}: He's greedy and ambitious.
{DIALOGUE}: If he knew about Lecter's link to Bill, he's go straight to the newspapers...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chilton falls into step beside Clarice, who has her briefcase.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He points his gold pen at her accusingly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON
{DIALOGUE}: What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me.
{DIALOGUE}: For the third time!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON
{DIALOGUE}: He's my patient!
{DIALOGUE}: I have rights!
{META_DATA}: (grabs her arm, stopping her)
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not just some turnkey, Miss Starling.
{DIALOGUE}: I shouldn't even be here this afternoon.
{DIALOGUE}: I had a ticket to Holiday on Ice.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She stares at him, with pity and distaste, till he lets go.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: I'm acting on instruction, Dr. Chilton.
{META_DATA}: (handing him a card)

{DIALOGUE}: Wouldn't you say, Clarice, that for a United States Senator, you're an odd choice of messenger?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice, sitting again at the desk-chair, is taking papers from her briefcase.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: I was your choice, Dr. Lecter.
{DIALOGUE}: You chose to speak to me.
{DIALOGUE}: Would you prefer someone else now?
{DIALOGUE}: Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?
{META_DATA}: (beat; he smiles)
{DIALOGUE}: Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: By the book, he's a sadist.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Life's too slippery for books, Clarice.
{DIALOGUE}: Typhoid and swans came from the same God.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.

{DIALOGUE}: Mmm.
{DIALOGUE}: And what else...?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat.
{DIALOGUE}: That hasn't been made public yet.
{DIALOGUE}: We don't know what is means.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Was it a butterfly?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{META_DATA}: (pause; staring at him)
{DIALOGUE}: A moth... How did you predict that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice.
{DIALOGUE}: Enchant me.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice looks down at her papers, taking a moment to collect her thoughts.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She looks up at him again, evenly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: If you help us find Buffalo Bill in time to save Catherine Martin, the Senator promises you a transfer to the V.A. hospital at Oneida Park, New York, with a view of the woods nearby.
{DIALOGUE}: Maximum security still applies, but you'd have reasonable access to books.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is silent.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She rises, moves closer, carrying papers.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Best of all, though - one week a year you'd get to leave the hospital and go here.
{META_DATA}: (points to a map)
{DIALOGUE}: Plum Island.
{DIALOGUE}: Every afternoon of that week you can walk on the beach or swim in the ocean for up to one hour.
{DIALOGUE}: Under SWAT team surveillance, of course...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His face remains neutral.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She puts the papers in his food tray.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Copy of the Buffalo Bill case file, copy of Senator Martin's terms.
{DIALOGUE}: Her offer is final and non-negotiable.
{DIALOGUE}: If Catherine dies -
{META_DATA}: (she slides his tray through)
{DIALOGUE}: You get nothing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A measured beat, before he rises smoothly, crosses, and looks down at the papers, without touching them.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: "Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center."
{DIALOGUE}: Sounds charming.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: That's just part of the island.
{DIALOGUE}: It has a very nice beach.
{DIALOGUE}: Terns nest there.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Terns... If I help you, Clarice, it will be "turns" with us, too.
{DIALOGUE}: Quid pro quo.
{DIALOGUE}: I tell you things, you tell me things.
{DIALOGUE}: Not about this case, though - about yourself.
{DIALOGUE}: Yes or no?
{META_DATA}: (she is silent)
{DIALOGUE}: Yes or no, Clarice.
{DIALOGUE}: Catherine is waiting.

{DIALOGUE}: The death of my father.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Tell me.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't lie, or I'll know.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice cannot bear the feverish excitement in his eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She looks past him, hesitating again.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Killed outright?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: He was strong, he lasted almost a month.
{DIALOGUE}: My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody.
{DIALOGUE}: I was ten years old.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: You're very frank, Clarice.
{DIALOGUE}: I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Quid pro quo, Doctor.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: The significance of the moth is change.
{DIALOGUE}: Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice.
{DIALOGUE}: But there's the problem of his size, you see.
{DIALOGUE}: Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{META_DATA}: (puzzled)
{DIALOGUE}: Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence.
{DIALOGUE}: Transsexuals are very passive.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Clever girl.
{DIALOGUE}: You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: Tell me why.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: After your father's death, you were orphaned.
{DIALOGUE}: What happened next?
{META_DATA}: (Clarice drops her gaze)
{DIALOGUE}: I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana.
{DIALOGUE}: They had a ranch.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: A cattle ranch?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Horses - and sheep...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: How long did you live there?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Two months.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Why so briefly?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: I - ran away...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Why, Clarice?
{DIALOGUE}: Did the rancher fuck you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{META_DATA}: (angrily)
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Did he try to?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: No...!
{DIALOGUE}: Quid pro quo, Doctor.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is.
{DIALOGUE}: He tries to be.
{DIALOGUE}: He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center.
{DIALOGUE}: I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: On what basis would they reject him?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: The personality inventories would trip him up.
{DIALOGUE}: Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: How would he test?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly Dr. Lecter snarls, loudly, stretching.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice take a sharp step backwards before he smiles, turning his movement into an elaborate yawn.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He gathers the papers from his tray.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{DIALOGUE}: That's enough, I think.
{DIALOGUE}: Happy hunting.
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away.
{DIALOGUE}: Shall I summarize?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{META_DATA}: (shaken)
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, Doctor.
{DIALOGUE}: Please.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: VERY CLOSE ON a cocoon, split along its back, as a living Death's-head Moth wriggles torturously free.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Trembling and damp, the new creature clings to a sprig of nightshade.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: You should try to obtain a list of males rejected from all three gender reassignment centers...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: PULLING BACK
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: we see a big wire cage, holding several of the moths.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They crawl over the humus floor or feed at honeycombs, wings pumping lazily.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In the distant background, the incongruous SOUND of show music.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Check first the ones rejected for lying about criminal records...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CONTINUOUS MOVING ANGLE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: at about knee level, as we leave the cage, and begin to TRAVEL through this eerie, dimly-lit warren of a cellar.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As we go - occasionally TURNING corners, or skirting the dark openings of unexplored passages - various objects loom briefly INTO VIEW, overhead - a stainless-steel work table... a big sink... jars of chemicals... neat racks of gleaming knives...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Among those who tried to conceal their past, look for severe childhood disturbances, associated with violence... Possibly you'll find a childhood incarceration... Then go to their personality tests...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We pass a row of female mannequins, some nude, some wearing colorful leather jackets, designer knockoffs, in various stages of completion... then a huge maroon armoire, in Chinese lacquer; its double doors are slightly ajar... The jaunty background.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MUSIC is growing even louder: Fats Waller singing "Bye Bye Baby."
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And now we hear something else, too - the rapid CLICKING of a sewing machine...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Study their drawings, especially.
{DIALOGUE}: Billy's house drawings will show no happy future... No baby carriage, out in the yard.
{DIALOGUE}: No pets, no toys, no flowers, no sun...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We TURN another corner, and there is Mr. Gumb himself.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As we APPROACH, his wide back is to us; he's hunched over an old- fashioned sewing machine, humming cheerfully, and working a piece of material that we mercifully cannot see.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A female wig rests near him on a head form.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He wears a hairnet and a beautiful kimono, and pumps the treadle with his bare feet.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: His females will be more crudely sketched than him males - but he'll compensate by adding exaggerated adornments... jewelry, big breasts... And his tree drawings - oh, his trees will be frightful...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Next to Mr. Gumb is an antique phonograph - source of the MUSIC.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His little dog, Precious, perches by his plump ankles.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As we PASS Mr. Gumb, Precious scurries away from him, panting happily, and we FOLLOW the little dog down another corridor, the music starting to fade behind us...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Billy hates his own identity, he always has - and he thinks that makes him a transsexual.
{DIALOGUE}: But his pathology is a thousand times more savage... He wants to be reborn, Clarice.
{DIALOGUE}: He will be reborn...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At the end of this final corridor, the cellar widens into a low-ceilinged chamber, with two additional doorways, and in the center of this is the gaping circle of the oubliette.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Precious sniffs her way over to the edge - excited, tail wagging - than BARKS happily as we hear a hoarse, ghostly moan from below.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. DR. LECTER'S CORRIDOR - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MOVING ANGLE - CLOSE ON Dr. Lecter's slippered feet, which rest on the shelf of a rolling hand truck.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: RISING along his tilted form, we see that his ankles are linked by steel restraints... his legs, waist, upper torso, and arms are bound by heavy canvas webbing... beneath the webbing is a strait-jacket... and over his face is a hockey mask.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Bad news, Hannibal...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: WIDER ANGLE

{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON
{DIALOGUE}: Perhaps you should have been less specific about what kind.
{META_DATA}: (to Barney)
{DIALOGUE}: Stand him by the toilet.
{DIALOGUE}: Then leave us.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Barney props the hand truck into position, then both orderlies go.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chilton finishes another letter, sighs happily.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON
{DIALOGUE}: Such a lot of correspondence!
{DIALOGUE}: I can hardly wait to analyze it in more detail... But first things first.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Tossing letters onto the cot, he rises, crosses out into the corridor, and bends to remove a small tape recorder from underneath Clarice's desk.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He waggles it triumphantly at Dr. Lecter.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON
{DIALOGUE}: I thought she might be looking for a civil rights violation in Migg's death, so I bugged you... Not a word to me in all these years, Hannibal.
{DIALOGUE}: Then Crawford sends his bit of fluff over here, and you just turn to jelly.
{DIALOGUE}: It's too pathetic.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SIDE ANGLE - TWO SHOT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as Chilton, back in the cell, leans tauntingly close to the front of Dr. Lecter's mask.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON
{DIALOGUE}: You still think you're going to walk on some beach, and see the birdies?
{DIALOGUE}: I don't think so, Hannibal... I called Senator Ruth Martin, and she never heard of any deal with you.
{DIALOGUE}: She never heard of Clarice Starling, either.
{DIALOGUE}: They scammed you, Hannibal...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLOSE ON Dr. Lecter's glittering eyes, behind their slits.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON
{DIALOGUE}: When Crawford gets through milking you, he's giving you to Baltimore Homicide for the Raspail murder.
{DIALOGUE}: And they're preparing some special surprises for you right now, in my electroshock room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: DR. LECTER'S POV (FRAMED BY EYE-SLITS)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: first looking at Chilton's moving lips... then LOWERING to his soft, white, inviting throat...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON
{DIALOGUE}: The Starling bitch wants you to rot here, in this little box, till your teeth fall out and you're soiling diapers.
{DIALOGUE}: You've seen the old ones, Hannibal.
{DIALOGUE}: They weep when their stewed peaches get cold.
{DIALOGUE}: That'll be you, too.
{DIALOGUE}: Unless - you trade with me.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: FAVORING CHILTON
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as he sits chummily on the table.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON
{DIALOGUE}: There never was a deal with Senator Martin - but there is now.
{DIALOGUE}: I've been on the phone for hours, Hannibal, on your behalf.
{DIALOGUE}: Here's what you get: if you identify Buffalo Bill, and the girl is found in time, Senator Martin will have you transferred to Brushy Mountain State Prison, in Tennessee...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLOSE AGAIN ON DR. LECTER'S EYES
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as they shift restlessly, away from Chilton - then suddenly lock onto something.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They widen with interest.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: The Governor has already agreed.
{DIALOGUE}: You get books, a view of the woods, and plenty of exercise time...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: DR. LECTER'S POV - EXTREME CLOSEUP
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On the cot, carelessly left there, lying half-hidden under the letters and the rumpled sheet... is Chilton's gold pen.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: And best of all, you'd be out of Jack Crawford's reach, forever.
{DIALOGUE}: The Senator will verify these terms on the phone, and guarantee them in writing...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: BACK ON DR. LECTER
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as he stares a moment longer at the pen, then shifts his eyes towards Chilton.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We can almost hear his brain clicking.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON (O.S.)
{DIALOGUE}: In exchange, I get your full cooperation in publishing a professional account of this - my successful interviews with you.
{DIALOGUE}: You publish nothing.
{DIALOGUE}: And I get exclusive access to any material from Catherine Martin... So.
{DIALOGUE}: Do you accept my demands?
{META_DATA}: (pause)
{DIALOGUE}: Answer me, Hannibal.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dr. Lecter is silent.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chilton sticks his face INTO SHOT, almost intimately close to the mask.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is agitated.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHILTON
{DIALOGUE}: You'll answer me now, or by God, you'll answer to Baltimore Homicide.
{DIALOGUE}: Who is Buffalo Bill?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. LECTER
{META_DATA}: (pause; then softly)
{DIALOGUE}: I'll tell the Senator herself.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MOVING ANGLE - as the very impatient Crawford, clutching a folder, strides down a hall beside DR. DANIELSON - early 50's, severe, in a lab coat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Nurses, doctors, glance as they pass.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. DANIELSON
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not having a witch hunt here, Mr. Crawford!
{DIALOGUE}: Our patients are decent, non-violent people with a real problem.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient.
{DIALOGUE}: It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence.
{DIALOGUE}: Please, Doctor - time is eating us up.
{DIALOGUE}: Just show me the ones you've turned away.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Danielson enters a cramped, stainless steel nurse's gallery, with Crawford following, and pours himself a cup of coffee.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. DANIELSON
{META_DATA}: (adamantly)
{DIALOGUE}: Examination and interview materials are confidential.
{DIALOGUE}: We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: You want to see a violation?
{DIALOGUE}: This is a violation...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes a black & white photo from his folder, slaps it down in front of Danielson.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: From our angle, we can't see it clearly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd.
{DIALOGUE}: I met her on a slab in West Virginia.
{DIALOGUE}: And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. DANIELSON
{DIALOGUE}: That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford.
{DIALOGUE}: I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Crawford strains for patience.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Look... search your own records, if you prefer.
{DIALOGUE}: You can do it a lot faster than us, anyway.
{DIALOGUE}: If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, I'll suppress it.
{DIALOGUE}: Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. DANIELSON
{DIALOGUE}: I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford.
{DIALOGUE}: Truth will out... And then what?
{DIALOGUE}: Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity?
{DIALOGUE}: Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson.
{DIALOGUE}: Very humorous.
{DIALOGUE}: You like the truth?
{DIALOGUE}: Try this.
{META_DATA}: (right in his face, enraged)
{DIALOGUE}: He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off.
{DIALOGUE}: We don't want him to do that anymore.
{DIALOGUE}: If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news.
{DIALOGUE}: And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation.
{DIALOGUE}: And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DR. DANIELSON
{META_DATA}: (pause; stiffly)
{DIALOGUE}: It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this.
{DIALOGUE}: And get back to you.

{DIALOGUE}: Jack - did you make some sort of promise to Lecter, in the Senator's name?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Listening to the answer, he looks uncomfortably across his desk at PAUL KRENDLER, the Deputy Attorney General - 40, very tanned, modish haircut.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Krendler is irritable, impatient.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DIRECTOR BURKE
{META_DATA}: (on phone)
{DIALOGUE}: We're going to have to talk about this, Jack.
{DIALOGUE}: The Senator's mad as hell.
{DIALOGUE}: Paul Krendler's over here from Justice, she's asking him to take charge in Memphis... I know that... But you're still in command of the task force, and Lecter's plane can still be ordered back.

{DIALOGUE}: It's not a consideration.
{DIALOGUE}: But you are...
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: You've done enough.
{DIALOGUE}: If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled.
{DIALOGUE}: Cost you six months, at least.

{META_DATA}: (he stops, looks at her)
{DIALOGUE}: Now's your chance, Starling.
{DIALOGUE}: Go back to class.
{DIALOGUE}: Leave Bill to me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks at her steadily, then nods.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They walk on.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: Lecter is still the key, I know he is.
{DIALOGUE}: Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Or just as worthless.
{DIALOGUE}: But I want you in Memphis, close to him.
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again.
{DIALOGUE}: There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She smiles at this acknowledgment; he never thought she's quit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CLARICE
{DIALOGUE}: I lied to Lecter.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CRAWFORD
{DIALOGUE}: Good idea.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In her raw-nerved darkness, every SOUND is unnaturally magnified - the HUM of the refrigerator... the TRICKLE of water... her own terrified BREATHING, and Catherine's faraway, echoing SOBS... Moths smack against her face and arms.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She eases forward, then stops again, listens... She eases forward again, following her gun, and creeps directly in front of, and then past -
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MR. GUMB
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: who has flattened himself against a wall, arms spread like a high priest, Colt in one hand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He wears his goggles and kimono, and under that - draping down over his naked arms, like some hideous mantle - his terrifying, half-completed suit of human skins.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is an exquisite moment for him - a ritual of supreme exaltation.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: THE TWO FIGURES
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: almost at point-black range, guns ROARING hugely, one FLASH from Mr. Gumb, and one two three four FLASHES from Clarice, overlapping his, and then, as the ECHOES crash deafeningly -
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CLOSE ON CLARICE - LOW ANGLE -
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: with NORMAL SPEED RESTORED, as the side of her face hits the floor, and she is gasping, stunned by the noise and flames; there is blood on her check, and an ugly powder burn, but she ignores them, twisting to yank her speedloader from her jacket pocket, locking it blindly onto her gun's cylinder, reloading, right in front of her face, then rolling onto her stomach, aiming her gun upward again, blinking her dazzled eyes, straining to locate him in the darkness... Where is he, where...?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, as the ECHOES finally fade, she hears something else - a tortured, sucking, WHISTLE from perhaps eight feet away...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MOVING ANGLE - WITH CLARICE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as she crawls forward, on her elbows, following her gun, until it bumps against Mr. Gumb's shoulder.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is lying on his back, chest a bloody mess.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She slides her muzzle against his head, hard, but he doesn't move; another shot isn't needed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stares upwards, through his goggles, bloody lips working.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He tries to speak, but cannot.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: One hand reaches slowly upwards, the fingers twitching, as if to seize something, overhead... Then a final, ghastly groan, his hand drops, he is dead.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Clarice feels for a pulse at his neck, making sure.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, and only then, does she permit herself to roll over, collapsing onto her back beside him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: OVERHEAD ANGLE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: down at the two faces - intimately close together, like lovers on their pillow.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, as we PULL SLOWLY AWAY, we see that her staring eyes, and his dead gaze, are both locked onto -
