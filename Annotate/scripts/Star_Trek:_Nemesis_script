{META_DATA}: FADE IN:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. MEDICAL MONTAGE - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Life.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Glorious in its many forms.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The biological pulse finding its way heroically through the cold manipulation of science.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CREDITS as we see a beautiful montage of futuristic medical technology.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Through a microscope we see cells multiplying and gene strands exponentially increasing with the vibrancy of exploding flowers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see laser splicing and biological manipulation on the molecular level.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CREDITS continue as we fade to...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Politics... In a cavernous, shadowy chamber.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Dark figures lean together and talk seriously.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Their hushed, urgent tones denote the gravity of their discussion.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We can't make out the words but there is no doubt what they are talking about.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The three year old HUMAN BOY who stands before them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The boy is alone and frightened, lost in the sweeping grandeur of the massive chamber.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CREDITS continue as we fade to...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. REMAN HOMEWORLD - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Labor...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On a stark, desert planet with monolithic mountains and harsh crags shooting upward.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The only light in this dark netherworld comes from the flames that accompany the hellish mining operations everywhere around us.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The human boy gazes over this desolate vista and then he looks up for a moment... at the stars.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then a tall figure leads him firmly into one of the mines.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The boy seems to disappear into this flaming crucible.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: CREDITS end as we go to...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. ROMULUS - SUNSET
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The sun is setting on the capital city of the great Romulan Star Empire, The imperial monoliths and martial towers of this bustling city glow red as the sun dips below the horizon.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We slowly move down toward the most imposing building of the city.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Romulan Senate chamber.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - SUNSET
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: SENATOR TAL'AURA watches the proceedings with a studied look of bored indifference.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She glances to the familiar Romulan crest that dominates one wall of the chamber: a ferocious bird-of-prey holding two planets, one in either claw.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then her eyes carefully cross the chamber to...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: PRAETOR HIREN -- the head of the Romulan government -- presiding over the Senate from a throne-like chair.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is a capable politician in his 50s.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SENATOR 1
{DIALOGUE}: ... but if we hesitate we'll lose this important source of dilithium.
{DIALOGUE}: A trade agreement is in the best interests of the Empire.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SENATOR 2
{DIALOGUE}: Praetor, I recommend we dispatch a diplomatic mission to Celes II to open negotiations.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Senator Tal'Aura grunts slightly at the word "negotiations."
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Praetor Hiren glances to her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PRAETOR
{DIALOGUE}: Senator Tal'Aura, you disagree with the motion.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TAL'AURA
{DIALOGUE}: No, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: I would say "negotiation" is to be advised.
{DIALOGUE}: I support all "diplomatic" overtures.
{DIALOGUE}: But if you will excuse me, Praetor, I have an appointment with the Tholian ambassador.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Praetor nods.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Tal'Aura stands and leaves the chamber... but she had left something behind on her desk.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A small, silver box with unusual etchings on the surface.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The discussion continues as we focus on the silver box...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PRAETOR
{DIALOGUE}: Then I will call for a vote on the motion to open trade negotiations with Celes II...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Senator at the desk next to Tal'Aura's glances over.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The silver box is moving.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Senator watches, amazed, as the box begins to slowly fold open.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then "legs" appear.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The box unfolds like a spider, standing on its legs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then it is still for a moment.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Senator looks at it, puzzled.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly -- a bright beam of green light shoots up from the spider -- the Senators are stunned -- the beam shoots to the high domed ceiling of the chamber and then cascades around the interior of the room, enveloping everything in a glowing shroud of green energy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In a way, it is bizarrely beautiful.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then just as suddenly the light disappears.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A moment of silence.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Praetor and Senators are baffled.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PRAETOR
{DIALOGUE}: Would someone please tell me what that was?
{META_DATA}: (he turns to a guard)
{DIALOGUE}: Alert security --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A plant behind the Praetor begins to shrivel...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PRAETOR
{DIALOGUE}: -- and have them run a --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Praetor stops suddenly -- as the flesh begins to melt from his face.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Every bit of organic matter in the chamber decays.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Flesh melts from bones while the Senators scream in agony.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Every living thing in the chamber is dead within ten seconds.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A stunning moment of silence as we take in the carnage.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then a transporter effect ripples around the spider-weapon.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It disappears.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And the Romulan Senate is no more.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We fade to...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. EARTH, ALASKA - PAVILION - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: JEAN LUC PICARD, the most beloved and respected Captain in Starfleet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His face is resolute and set.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Even stern.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His white dress uniform is buttoned tightly to the neck.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks at us evenly and then utters the word that has been the watch cry for his entire life as a Starfleet officer.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Duty...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He lets the word resonate and then continues.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: A starship captain's life is filled with solemn duty.
{DIALOGUE}: I have commanded men in battle.
{DIALOGUE}: I have negotiated peace treaties between implacable enemies.
{DIALOGUE}: I have represented the Federation in first contact with twenty-seven alien species.
{DIALOGUE}: But none of this compares to my solemn duty as... Best man.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Uproarious laughter.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We pull back to reveal the wedding reception of WILL RIKER and DEANNA TROI.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Enterprise CREW is gathered with invited GUESTS, some from other "Star Trek" series.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riker and Deanna sit at the center of a long table.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Now, I know that on an occasion such as this: it is expected that I be gracious and fulsome with praise on the wonders of this blessed union... But have you two considered what you're doing to?
{DIALOGUE}: This is all a damned inconvenience...
{META_DATA}: (laughter from the crowd)
{DIALOGUE}: While you're happily settling in on the Titan, I'll have to train a new first officer; no doubt a stern martinet who'll quote the rule book at me and never... ever... allow me to go on away missions.
{META_DATA}: (laughter)
{DIALOGUE}: ... Then there's the matter of my new counselor.
{DIALOGUE}: Undoubtedly some soft-spoken, willowy thing who'll be probing into my darkest psyche as she nods her head and coos sympathetically.
{DIALOGUE}: Isn't that right, Deanna?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Deanna nods her head and coos sympathetically.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hearty, wonderful LAUGHTER!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you.
{DIALOGUE}: As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical.
{DIALOGUE}: Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole' me?!
{DIALOGUE}: I'll probably get some old battle- axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I don't show up for my physical on time!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{DIALOGUE}: It'll serve you right.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Laughter, laughter, laughter!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks to Riker and Deanna:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Really, it's not too late to reconsider.
{DIALOGUE}: No?
{DIALOGUE}: Very well then...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He smiles and raises his glass, looks at them deeply.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Will Riker, you have been my trusted right arm for fourteen years; you have helped keep my course true and steady.
{DIALOGUE}: Deanna Troi, you have been my conscience and best guide, the touchstone to the better parts of myself.
{DIALOGUE}: You are my family.
{DIALOGUE}: And in proper maritime tradition I wish you full sails and a clear horizon... My friends, make it so.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They drink.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. EARTH, ALASKA - PAVILION - LATER
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The party guests mingle as a band plays.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We are at a beautiful open-air pavilion high in the Denali Mountains.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The soaring ranges of Riker's native Alaska can be seen everywhere around us.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: DR. BEVERLY CRUSHER goes to Picard.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{META_DATA}: (playfully)
{DIALOGUE}: Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{DIALOGUE}: If you start tearing up I promise to beam you out.
{DIALOGUE}: Level one medical emergency.
{DIALOGUE}: There's no crying in Starfleet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They head off toward Riker and Deanna.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Meanwhile, GEORDI LA FORGE sits with his girlfriend.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEAH
{DIALOGUE}: I've never seen your Captain so nostalgic.
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe he's getting soft in his old age.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{META_DATA}: (laughs)
{DIALOGUE}: Not likely.
{DIALOGUE}: After we installed the new Series Four replicators, he tried to order his usual tea and there was a glitch.
{DIALOGUE}: Had us remove the whole bunch of them and put the old ones back in.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LEAH
{DIALOGUE}: There!
{DIALOGUE}: Nostalgic about old replicators.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: He just likes things the way he likes them...
{META_DATA}: (he looks at her, smiles)
{DIALOGUE}: Of course, so do I.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He kisses her gently as WORF comes to them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Poor Worf is still suffering a bit from the bachelor party.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He plops down beside them, belches.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: Romulan ale should be illegal.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: It is, old chum.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: Then it should be more illegal.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He groans and rests his head on the table, acts like he's going to heave.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Meanwhile, Riker and Deanna are talking to Picard and Beverly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: The least I could do for you, Deanna.
{DIALOGUE}: Besides, you know me... I'm a talking head.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: And you needn't worry.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: The hell you will.
{DIALOGUE}: You know too much about me as it is... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: No, no speeches.
{DIALOGUE}: No clothes either.
{META_DATA}: (winks, mischievously)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard looks at him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Deanna laughs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then the band stops playing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All turn.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: DATA stands with the band.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Ladies and Gentlemen and invited Tran gendered species... In my study of Terran and Betazoid conjugal rites I have discovered it is traditional to present the "happy couple" with a gift.
{DIALOGUE}: Given Commander Riker's affection for archaic musical forms I have elected to present the following as my gift in honor of their conjugation.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riker shoots an amused glance to Deanna.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Conjugation?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data turns to the band leader.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: If you please, Mister Band Leader, a-one and a-two and...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The band launches into a jaunty, swing version of the Irving Berlin standard "Blue Skies."
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{META_DATA}: (sings)
{DIALOGUE}: "Blue skies, smiling at me, Nothing but blue skies do I see.
{DIALOGUE}: Blue birds, singing a song, Nothing but blue birds all day long.
{DIALOGUE}: Never saw the sun shining so bright, Never saw things going so right..."
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crowd is appreciative.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Loves the song.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Except Worf, he momentarily raises his head from the table.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{META_DATA}: (groans)
{DIALOGUE}: Ugghhh... Irving Berlin.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His heads thumps down again, is about ready to BARF!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Meanwhile, Riker is anxious as a kid to join the band:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{META_DATA}: (smiles)
{DIALOGUE}: All right, go ahead.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riker eagerly joins the band.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Grabs the trombone and starts jamming with the orchestra.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The song really swings.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (to Deanna)
{DIALOGUE}: May I have this dance?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: With pleasure, Captain.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Meanwhile, Geordi leads Leah to the dance floor as well.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beverly goes to Worf.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{DIALOGUE}: Commander Worf... Do Klingons swing?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: I am not a swinger.
{DIALOGUE}: I am unwell.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{DIALOGUE}: Don't worry, I'm a doctor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She pulls him to the dance floor as:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{DIALOGUE}: I'm so glad you made it back to the Enterprise before I left.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: I was not suited for the life of a..
{DIALOGUE}: diplomat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{META_DATA}: (wry)
{DIALOGUE}: Who'd have guessed?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They dance.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard and Deanna sweep past them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And we pull up and away as Data continues to sing and the crew dances.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is a joyous celebration of these people.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This family.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A family we love.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. ENTERPRISE - SPACE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Enterprise streaks through space.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data sits in the empty Crew Lounge.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As always, the android's placid, neutral expression still somehow manages to convey his wonder, curiosity and idiosyncratic zest for life.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard arrives with a very old bottle of wine.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: I've been saving this.
{DIALOGUE}: Chateau Picard 2267.
{DIALOGUE}: Batten down the hatches...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He carefully uncorks the treasured bottle as:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: They say a vintner's history is in every glass.
{DIALOGUE}: The soil he came from.
{DIALOGUE}: His past as well as his hopes for the future.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pours two glasses of the wine, then raises his glass, a toast.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: So... To happy endings.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: To happy endings.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard carefully takes a tiny sip, savors the flavor, finally swallows.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Enjoys it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ahhh.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data mimics Picard.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Taking a tiny sip, savoring the flavor and finally swallowing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Ahhh.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Sir.
{DIALOGUE}: I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding.
{DIALOGUE}: I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: I understand why it would seem confusing.
{DIALOGUE}: Certain human rituals -- like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions.
{DIALOGUE}: These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Will and Deanna joining the Titan.
{DIALOGUE}: Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: And this makes you "sad"?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Well.
{DIALOGUE}: I suppose it does a bit.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them.
{DIALOGUE}: The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: That is because you have a familiarity with them.
{DIALOGUE}: You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{DIALOGUE}: And, frankly, I envy them as well.
{DIALOGUE}: They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them.
{DIALOGUE}: New worlds to conquer...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes another sip of wine.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Seeing Will and Deanna today made me think about some of the choices I've made in my own life.
{DIALOGUE}: Devoting myself to Starfleet... Not marrying or having children... All the choices that led me here.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data thinks about it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: The choices I made have led me here as well.
{DIALOGUE}: This is the only home I have ever known.
{DIALOGUE}: I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: You never know what's over the horizon, Data.
{DIALOGUE}: Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
{DIALOGUE}: Data looks at him; he has never really considered this.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior.
{DIALOGUE}: I would "miss you."
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (smiles)
{DIALOGUE}: Now, you make a toast.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: To new worlds...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: New worlds.
{DIALOGUE}: Yes Data, brave new worlds...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They drink.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ROMULAN SENATE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Flickering braziers dimly illuminate the cold, martial splendor of a Senate corridor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: COMMANDER DONATRA and COMMANDER SURAN stride through the corridor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suran is an elder Romulan officer, respected and tenacious.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Donatra -- a key figure in this story so pay close attention to her -- is a mature, beautiful woman... not without a dry sense of humor.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SURAN
{DIALOGUE}: The fleet commanders are nervous.
{DIALOGUE}: They've agreed to remain at their given coordinates and await his orders.
{DIALOGUE}: But they're anxious to know what's going on here.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DONATRA
{DIALOGUE}: I don't blame them.
{DIALOGUE}: We can't keep them in the dark forever.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A voice, from the shadows:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICEROY (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: But in darkness, there is strength.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Donatra and Suran stop.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And the VICEROY steps from the shadows...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is a terrifying sight A powerful, monstrous alien creature; a tall, ashen-skinned ectomorph who bears a disturbing resemblance to the original Nosferatu.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is vampiric and lethal.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is a Reman.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICEROY
{DIALOGUE}: Don't you agree?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He leads them along the corridor.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We observe the Romulan crest, an imposing bird-of-prey clutching a planet in either claw, not unlike the KAOS emblem from "Get Smart," that dominates a wall.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As we hear:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Consider it The great symbol of the Empire... But the bird-of-prey holds planets.
{DIALOGUE}: Romulus, Remus.
{DIALOGUE}: Their destinies conjoined...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then we see him... SHINZON!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is a dynamic young human in his twenties.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Very handsome with pale, almost white skin and shining, golden hair.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He wears a striking Reman military uniform.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stands in the center of the eerily deserted chamber.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The entire floor is a large star chart.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Yet for generations one of those planets has been without a voice.
{DIALOGUE}: We will be silent no longer.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Senator Tal'Aura (the female Senator who planted the weapon in the Senate chamber earlier) and two other ROMULAN COMMANDERS sit.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Cadres of Shinzon's fearsome REMAN WARRIORS stand around the chamber.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are his sinister children of the night.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Even more chilling now in the flickering torch light.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's like something out of Tim Burton.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Donatra and Suran enter the chamber with Shinzon's Viceroy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Join us, Commanders.
{DIALOGUE}: Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SURAN
{DIALOGUE}: They're holding position.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: And?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SURAN
{META_DATA}: (bows his head)
{DIALOGUE}: They will obey, Praetor.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: It's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DONATRA
{DIALOGUE}: They support your intentions, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: But they require evidence of your... sincerity.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon looks at her.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A quick beat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon decides to respond with benevolence.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He smiles.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: And they'll have it.
{META_DATA}: (he begins to pace over the star chart)
{DIALOGUE}: Tell the fleet that the days of negotiation and diplomacy are over.
{DIALOGUE}: The Almighty Federation will fall before us.
{DIALOGUE}: As I promised you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stands on the area of the map that denotes the Neutral Zone between the Romulan Empire and the Federation.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: The time we have dreamed of is at hand.
{DIALOGUE}: The time... of conquest.
{META_DATA}: (sinister laugh)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He carefully steps into the area of the map marked with the Federation symbol.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks down at the star chart.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Cut off the dragon's head and it cannot strike back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Donatra watches him carefully.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Something in his quiet words disturbs her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SURAN
{DIALOGUE}: How many Warbirds will you need?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: None.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They look at him, stunned.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SURAN
{DIALOGUE}: Praetor.
{DIALOGUE}: You have the whole fleet at your disposal.
{DIALOGUE}: They supported the coup, they'll follow you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: The Scimitar will serve my needs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SURAN
{DIALOGUE}: But surely --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: I came this far alone...
{META_DATA}: (he looks at his Reman warriors)
{DIALOGUE}: We came this far alone.
{DIALOGUE}: We require no assistance from the fleet.
{DIALOGUE}: Now leave me to my thoughts.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Commanders and Senator Tal'Aura rise and leave.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon looks to his Viceroy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Are we prepared?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICEROY
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, Praetor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: So many years for this moment.
{META_DATA}: (he looks up at his Viceroy, smiles)
{DIALOGUE}: Bring him to me.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The bridge crew are at their stations.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard is not on the bridge.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{META_DATA}: (grumbles)
{DIALOGUE}: I won't do it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: It's tradition,Worf.
{DIALOGUE}: You of all people should appreciate that!
{META_DATA}: (whispers)
{DIALOGUE}: Besides, I've already seen it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: A warrior does not appear without his clothing.
{DIALOGUE}: It leaves him... vulnerable.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: I don't think we're going to see much combat on Betazed.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: Don't be too sure.
{DIALOGUE}: Mother will be there.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Worf groans.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard emerges from his Ready Room as:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: I won't do it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Won't do what, Mister Worf?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: Captain.
{DIALOGUE}: I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...
{META_DATA}: (hates the word)
{DIALOGUE}: ... naked.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you?
{DIALOGUE}: What are you afraid of?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Deanna laughs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then a readout on Worf's console attracts his attention:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: What sort of signature?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Worf looks up.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Glances at Data.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: Positronic.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - LATER
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi is at the Engineering station with Picard, Riker and Data.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: What do we know about the planet?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: Uncharted.
{DIALOGUE}: We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (to Data)
{DIALOGUE}: Theories?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: I thought only me, myself and Lore.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{META_DATA}: (looking at star chart)
{DIALOGUE}: Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (looking at star chart)
{DIALOGUE}: Still well on our side...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard glances at Data, recognizes the android's deep desire to explore this possible connection to others like himself.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: I think it's worth a look.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: Thank you, sir...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (to all, especially Worf)
{DIALOGUE}: Where we will all honor the Betazoid traditions.
{DIALOGUE}: No cold feet, or any other parts of our anatomy.
{DIALOGUE}: Now, if you'll excuse me.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll be in the gym.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He goes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{META_DATA}: (to Helm Officer)
{DIALOGUE}: Mister Branson, set course for the Kolarin system.
{DIALOGUE}: Warp Five --
{META_DATA}: (Deanna shoots him a glance)
{DIALOGUE}: -- Warp Seven.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HELM OFFICER (MISTER BRANSON)
{DIALOGUE}: Plotted and laid in, sir.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: Engage.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: You better believe you're engaged!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Meanwhile, Geordi and Data remain at the Engineering Station, studying the displays.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: What do you think, Data, a long- lost relative?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data doesn't respond, but the curiosity on his face is apparent.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. ENTERPRISE - OVER KOLARUS III - SPACE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Enterprise is in orbit around the uncharted planet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In the distance we can see the distorting violence of an ion storm.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kolarus III is on the viewscreen, the ion storm raging beyond it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: What do we know about the population?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Isolated pockets of humanoids.
{DIALOGUE}: It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly.
{DIALOGUE}: It could head this way without much warning.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Understood.
{DIALOGUE}: Data, Worf, you're with me.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard, Data and Worf start heading toward the turbolift.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{META_DATA}: (stands, protesting)
{DIALOGUE}: Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: Sir --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Captain's prerogative, Will.
{DIALOGUE}: There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He steps into the turbolift with the Data and Worf.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: You have the bridge, Mister Troi!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The turbolift doors slide shut.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The bridge crew heartily enjoys Riker's momentary demotion to house husband.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. ENTERPRISE - OVER KOLARUS III - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The shuttlebay doors slide open and the transport vehicle Argo emerges.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Argo is larger than a regular shuttle with a particularly large cargo area at the back.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. KOLARUS III - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Argo lands on the planet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is primarily a desert environment with some canyons and mountains.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Like Death Valley, blazing heat waves shimmer in the distance.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The shuttle sits silently for a moment.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We wonder at the delay, then...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The rear cargo doors slide open and Picard, Data and Worf roar out on a 24th Century equivalent of a military jeep!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard drives, Data beside him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Worf stands in the back at a mounted phaser canon.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is a muscular, exciting vehicle; a Starfleet version of the jeep from old television series "The Rat Patrol."
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard screeches to a stop.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data and Worf lurch.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A cloud of dust momentarily obscures them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data quickly monitors the positronic signatures with a tricorder:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Thank you, Data.
{META_DATA}: (he smiles)
{DIALOGUE}: Let's see what she can do.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He roars off in a cloud of dust!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard clearly enjoys driving.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He roars over the desert terrain at breakneck speed, having a hell of a good time.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His comrades don't exactly appreciate his free-spirited driving panache.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Worf clings on to the mounted phaser canon for dear life.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data steadies himself by grasping onto the rollbar
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: I will always be baffled by the human predilection for piloting vehicles at unsafe velocities.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard smiles and drives a little faster.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{META_DATA}: (monitoring with tricorder)
{DIALOGUE}: Over that rise, sir... half a kilometer.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They continue on.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Before long they can see something on the level desert floor before them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They approach and stop to discover...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An android arm.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The fingers patiently drumming the ground.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: It appears to be...
{META_DATA}: (he scans with his tricorder)
{DIALOGUE}: ... an arm.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{META_DATA}: (suspicious)
{DIALOGUE}: Why is it moving?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Like me, it has been designed with modular power sources.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Mister Worf, if you please.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Worf climbs from the jeep and carefully approaches the arm.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Gingerly picks it up.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The arm responds to being picked up, the hand starts feeling around in the air like something from a horror movie.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Worf shudders.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He returns to the jeep.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Quickly sets the arm down in the rear cargo area.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: The next signature is one kilometer to the south.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard starts the jeep in motion.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Time passes as they continue on... coming across another arm... a leg... a torso... another leg... various disassembled components of a Data-like android!
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. JEEP - KOLARUS III - CANYON - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Worf stands uneasily amidst the moving body parts.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is only one component missing: the head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard steers the jeep into a canyon.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Stops.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data scans with his tricorder, pointing it up into the gently sloping hills that form the sides of the canyon.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: The final signature is approximately 300 meters up that incline.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Mister Worf, accompany Data please.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{META_DATA}: (uneasy)
{DIALOGUE}: To find the head, sir?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (amused)
{DIALOGUE}: If you don't mind.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Worf and Data climb up into the hills in pursuit of the final piece as Picard opens the jeep's hood and checks the engine.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. KOLARUS III - HILLS - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Worf and Data climb as Data scans and indicates the direction:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Ten meters...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Worf pulls his phaser, ready.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: I think it unlikely you will need your phaser to recover the cranial unit.
{DIALOGUE}: Of course, it could bite you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then they see it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data's head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Or the spitting image anyway.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lying inert in the dust before them.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: It's you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: The resemblance is... striking.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then the head's eyes suddenly pop open.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It looks up at them with a sort of blank, childlike wonder.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HEAD
{DIALOGUE}: Why am I looking at me?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: You are not looking at yourself.
{DIALOGUE}: You are looking at me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HEAD
{META_DATA}: (looking at Worf)
{DIALOGUE}: You do not look like me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{META_DATA}: (to head)
{DIALOGUE}: I would like to pick you up now.
{DIALOGUE}: May I do that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HEAD
{META_DATA}: (to Worf)
{DIALOGUE}: You have a pretty shirt.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: Thank you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data gently picks up the head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Looks at it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The two identical faces gaze at each other.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Fascinating...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then BLAM!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -- a boulder near them explodes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Worf and Data spin to see...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A nomadic tribe of desert ALIENS swarming toward them firing primitive plasma weapons --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data and Worf race back down the canyon, toward the jeep -- some open-field running and a bit of phaser action -- Worf firing to distract and slow the aliens, not kill them -- through all of this the head is chattering away blandly:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HEAD
{DIALOGUE}: I have two arms and ten fingers.
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know where my arms are?
{DIALOGUE}: I cannot see where we are going.
{DIALOGUE}: Where are we going?
{META_DATA}: (Etc..
{DIALOGUE}: like Threepio in "Empire" when he's strapped to Chewbacca's back.)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The action continues.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then Data finds himself almost surrounded --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Commander!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Worf turns -- Data throws the head to Worf like a football, a perfect spiral -- the head is still chattering away -- Worf catches it --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: STOP TALKING!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The head abruptly stops talking.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data, hands free now, quickly incapacitates the aliens around him with a dazzling demonstration of his superior strength and agility.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Meanwhile, Worf tucks the head under his arm and sprints like a master running back -- evading aliens and occasionally firing his phaser --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are closer to the jeep now -- but they are in trouble -- the swarm of aliens almost overtaking them -- !
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When a thundering BLAST sends up a shower of debris, stopping the aliens -- Picard is standing in the rear of the jeep, firing the phaser canon.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data and Worf climb into the jeep as Picard leaps into the front seat and roars off --
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT./ EXT. JEEP - KOLARUS III - FOLLOWING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Worf, standing at the phaser canon, quickly hands the head to Data in the front seat:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: If you wouldn't mind.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Thank you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The head looks up at Picard.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HEAD
{DIALOGUE}: You have a shiny head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard glances at the head.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: He is very observant.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: I can see that.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: Captain!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard turns to see that they are being pursued!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The aliens are racing after them in crude desert-terrain vehicles --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (to Data)
{DIALOGUE}: Shall we try some "unsafe velocities?"
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He floors it -- racing across the desert landscape.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Worf fires the mounted phaser canon -- blasting away at the aliens, not killing them, just stopping them -- a few dramatic crashes as the alien vehicles overturn --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Meanwhile:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HEAD
{META_DATA}: (to Picard)
{DIALOGUE}: You have a red shirt.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{META_DATA}: (to head)
{DIALOGUE}: This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HEAD
{DIALOGUE}: Why?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HEAD
{DIALOGUE}: Why?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Data!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Sorry, sir.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They continue to speed over the landscape -- bouncing and flying over natural rises in the terrain -- trying to evade their pursuers --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard puts the pedal to the metal and races through the alien vehicles -- weaving in and out, avoiding their fire -- Worf blasts away with the phaser cannon -- an exhilarating adventure --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Finally they are within sight of the Argo -- but they see it is surrounded by more of the aliens!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Mister Data.
{DIALOGUE}: Let's make like the wind.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data punches some buttons on a dashboard console -- and the Argo LIFTS OFF by remote control --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data uses the console to swing the Argo around and lower the rear cargo doors -- it hovers over the surface --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard floors the jeep -- using a natural rise in the terrain as a ramp -- the jeep FLIES THROUGH THE AIR -- over the aliens -- and into the cargo bay --
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ARGO - CARGO BAY - FOLLOWING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard slams on the brakes -- the jeep screeches to a stop as the doors shut and the Argo shoots into the air.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard climbs from the jeep.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He nonchalantly rubs a bit of dirt from the hood and then disappears into the main cabin.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data and Worf remain in the jeep for a beat, stunned.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{META_DATA}: (smiles)
{DIALOGUE}: He must have Klingon blood.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING LAB - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beverly gazes at the android head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It gazes back at her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{DIALOGUE}: I think you have nicer eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We pull back to reveal she is speaking to Data.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data stands with Picard, Riker and Geordi.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Our eyes are identical, Doctor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The android is in a framework rig that holds the various body parts in place.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The parts are not yet assembled
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: Geordi?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{META_DATA}: (at work analyzing the torso section)
{DIALOGUE}: Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic development.
{DIALOGUE}: The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated.
{DIALOGUE}: I'd say he's a prototype.
{DIALOGUE}: Something Dr. Soong created before Data.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{META_DATA}: (to head)
{DIALOGUE}: Do you have a name, sir?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HEAD
{DIALOGUE}: I am the B-9.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Be-nign.
{DIALOGUE}: Dr. Soong's penchant for whimsical names seems to have no end.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HEAD
{META_DATA}: (to Riker)
{DIALOGUE}: You have a fuzzy face.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (trying to ignore the head)
{DIALOGUE}: Keep me informed, Number One, and, please, put him back together.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He goes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi and Data begin to reassemble the B-9 piece by piece like the Tin Man as:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{META_DATA}: (blandly)
{DIALOGUE}: I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds."
{DIALOGUE}: They are fat.
{DIALOGUE}: They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians."
{DIALOGUE}: The "Bolians" are blue.
{DIALOGUE}: They put me in a seat and asked me questions.
{DIALOGUE}: Then they were attacked by another ship...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Time passes...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And still the B-9 is yammering blandly away.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is more fully assembled By this time Beverly is thoroughly bored.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{DIALOGUE}: Then people called the Delviciansans picked me up.
{DIALOGUE}: They have long teeth.
{DIALOGUE}: They asked if I do anything to help them.
{DIALOGUE}: I told them I could do whatever they wanted.
{DIALOGUE}: They asked me to clean out the matrix manifolds.
{DIALOGUE}: I told them I did not know what an Matrix manifold looks like.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{DIALOGUE}: Excuse me.
{DIALOGUE}: I have some diagnostics to run on some medical scanner things.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She quickly exits.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{DIALOGUE}: And after they showed me the "engine manifolds."
{DIALOGUE}: Then they showed me something called a "plasma mop"
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Time passes...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And still the B-9 is yammering away.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is almost completely assembled by now.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riker is bored out of his mind.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{DIALOGUE}: ... then the "Cardassians" put me into something called a "garbage chute" and I went out into space again --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF (V.O.) (ON COMM)
{DIALOGUE}: Worf to Commander Riker.
{DIALOGUE}: I have the tactical manifests ready, sir.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{META_DATA}: (quickly tapping his comm badge)
{DIALOGUE}: Worf!
{DIALOGUE}: Wonderful!
{DIALOGUE}: I'll be right there!
{META_DATA}: (he stands)
{DIALOGUE}: Duty calls, gentlemen.
{DIALOGUE}: Carry on.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He escapes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{DIALOGUE}: Fuzzy face is gone.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, please continue.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{DIALOGUE}: I was in space for a long time.
{DIALOGUE}: Then a ship belonging to the "Talosians" picked me up.
{DIALOGUE}: They asked me where I came from.
{DIALOGUE}: I told them people called the "Pakleds" took me from my homeworld.
{DIALOGUE}: They are fat...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi groans.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Time passes...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And still the B-9 is yammering away.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: By this time Geordi is slumped in a chair and only Data is listening.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The B-9 is fully assembled.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{DIALOGUE}: Then I opened my eyes and saw you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The B-9 is finally done with his tale...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know who I am?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{DIALOGUE}: You are me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: My name is Data... I am your brother.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riker and Deanna are having dinner with Worf.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{META_DATA}: (to Worf)
{DIALOGUE}: ... and after the ceremony on Betazed, three entire weeks for our honeymoon.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: We're going sailing on the Opal Sea.
{DIALOGUE}: We've booked an old-fashioned solar catamaran.
{DIALOGUE}: Just us and the sun and the waves.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: It seems a very... soft honeymoon.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{META_DATA}: (amused)
{DIALOGUE}: It's meant to be relaxing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: A Klingon honeymoon begins with the Kholamar desert march where the couple bonds in endurance trials.
{DIALOGUE}: If they survive the challenge they move on to the Fire Caves of Fek'lhr to face the demons of Gre'thor.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: Well, that sounds relaxing too.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: It is... invigorating.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They see Data enter the lounge, carefully leading the B-9.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: So they've got him up and running.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: He's a very unusual android
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{META_DATA}: (smiles)
{DIALOGUE}: Runs in the family.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They watch as Data leads the B-9 to a table.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data instructs him to sit.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The B-9 sits and stares forward placidly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data shows him how use a napkin.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A note of concern passes over Deanna's face as she watches Data and the B-9.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is something strangely poignant in the twin androids.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: One a bundle of curiosity and intelligence; the other somewhat like a slow, simple child.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard is at his replicator unit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Earl Grey, hot.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A cup of tea appears.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes it as the door chime sounds.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Come.
{META_DATA}: (Deanna enters)
{DIALOGUE}: Counselor.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: Do you have a moment, sir?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Of course, sit down.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He sits at his desk She sits across from him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: It's about Data I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled.
{DIALOGUE}: Data's desire for a "family" is very strong.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: You're speaking of emotional investment?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: The B-9 is like a slow child, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences.
{DIALOGUE}: He'll be disappointed when the B-9 cannot meet those expectations.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: I don't believe that, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: We've shared many disappointing journeys.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A quiet beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: I'm going to miss you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: And I you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are interrupted by a comm signal:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER (V.O.) (ON COMM)
{DIALOGUE}: Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Acknowledged...
{META_DATA}: (Deanna stands)
{DIALOGUE}: ... I'll talk to Data
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: Thank you, sir.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She goes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard activates his desktop viewscreen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: ADMIRAL KATHRYN JANEWAY appears on Picard's monitor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Janeway is the former captain of Voyager.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her new rank fits her well, she has lost none of her dry humor and down-to-earth charm which made her a household name and beloved cult figure.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Admiral Janeway.
{DIALOGUE}: Good to see you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
{DIALOGUE}: Jean Luc... How'd you like a trip to Romulus?
{DIALOGUE}: All expenses paid?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (smiles)
{DIALOGUE}: With or without the rest of the fleet?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
{DIALOGUE}: A diplomatic mission.
{DIALOGUE}: We've been invited, believe it or not.
{DIALOGUE}: Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup.
{DIALOGUE}: The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: New Praetor?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
{DIALOGUE}: There's more... as always.
{DIALOGUE}: He's Reman.
{META_DATA}: (Picard is surprised)
{DIALOGUE}: Believe me, we don't understand it either.
{DIALOGUE}: You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say.
{DIALOGUE}: Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Understood.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEEN)
{DIALOGUE}: We're sending you all the intelligence we have, but it's not much.
{DIALOGUE}: I don't need to tell you to watch your back, Jean Luc.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Not with the Romulans.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
{META_DATA}: (smiles wryly)
{DIALOGUE}: The Son'a, the Borg, the Romulans, the evil Soran and that pesky Nexus.
{DIALOGUE}: You seem to get all the easy assignments!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Just lucky, Admiral.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
{DIALOGUE}: Let's hope that luck holds.
{DIALOGUE}: Janeway out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The transmission ends.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard sits for a moment, intrigued.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he goes to the bridge
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard goes to his command chair:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (to Helm)
{DIALOGUE}: Lay in a new course... Take us to Romulus.
{DIALOGUE}: Warp eight.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crew is shocked.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HELM OFFICER
{DIALOGUE}: Aye aye, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: Course plotted and laid in...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: Romulus?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: I'm afraid the Opal Sea will have to wait, Number One... Engage.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. ENTERPRISE - SPACE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And the Enterprise jumps to high warp -- disappearing in a flash of dazzling light.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Yes!
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data conducts a briefing for the senior officers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Monitors currently show an image of Romulus and Remus in orbit around their sun.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: As you can see the habitable half of Remus is always in darkness because, like Mercury, one side always faces the sun.
{DIALOGUE}: Due to the extreme temperatures on that half of their world, the Remans live on the dark side of the planet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Various grainy and unclear new images appear to illustrate Data's words:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Almost nothing is known about the Reman homeworld, although intelligence scans have proven the existence of dilithium mining and heavy weapons construction.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Very obscure images of Remans appear, the crew can barely make out the monstrous figures:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: The Remans themselves are considered an undesirable caste in the hierarchy of the Empire.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: But they also have the reputation of being formidable warriors.
{DIALOGUE}: In the Dominion War, Reman forces were used as assault troops in the most violent encounters.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (grim)
{DIALOGUE}: Cannon fodder.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor?
{DIALOGUE}: I don't get it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: A coup d'etat?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: The Praetor's power has always been the Romulan fleet.
{DIALOGUE}: They must be behind him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard considers this.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (to Data)
{DIALOGUE}: What have you learned about Shinzon?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The images end.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There are no images of Shinzon.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record.
{DIALOGUE}: We can infer he is relatively young and a capable commander.
{DIALOGUE}: He fought seventeen major engagements in the war.
{DIALOGUE}: All successful.
{DIALOGUE}: Beyond that, we know nothing.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown.
{DIALOGUE}: Keep at it.
{DIALOGUE}: Anything you can give me would be appreciated.
{DIALOGUE}: Dismissed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The meeting breaks up.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING LAB - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The B-9 stares placidly forward.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We pull back and discover that computer conduits connect the B-9's head to Data's head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi monitors the connection.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: At present he serves no useful function.
{DIALOGUE}: Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society.
{DIALOGUE}: I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself.
{DIALOGUE}: If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: He'd have all your memories too.
{DIALOGUE}: You feel comfortable with that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: I feel nothing, Geordi.
{DIALOGUE}: It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: An individual more like you, you mean.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe he's not supposed to be like you.
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi completes his work
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: Okay... we're done.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi removes the computer connections from between their heads.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He carefully closes the panel in Data's head as:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{META_DATA}: (to B-9)
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know where you are?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{DIALOGUE}: I am in a room with lights.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks blankly at the console lights.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Can you remember our father?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data glances to Geordi.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Is that your final answer?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{META_DATA}: (to B-9)
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know my name?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{DIALOGUE}: You have a soft voice.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{META_DATA}: (gently)
{DIALOGUE}: Data, he's assimilating a lot of programming.
{DIALOGUE}: Remember, he's a prototype, a lot less sophisticated than you are.
{DIALOGUE}: We just don't know if his matrix will be able to adapt.
{DIALOGUE}: Or if he'll be able to retain anything.
{DIALOGUE}: We should give him some time.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data has been studying some circuitry in the B-9's neck.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: What purpose does this serve?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{META_DATA}: (also examining circuitry)
{DIALOGUE}: It seems to be a redundant memory port.
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing.
{DIALOGUE}: Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: No, I do not mind.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data looks at the B-9 with a sort of sadness.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: Don't give up hope, Data.
{DIALOGUE}: I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{META_DATA}: (looking at B-9)
{DIALOGUE}: I am not.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data stands.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The B-9 stands to follow.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: No, remain with Commander La Forge.
{DIALOGUE}: He is going to try to make you well.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The B-9 sits.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data goes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi watches him go.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. ENTERPRISE - OVER ROMULUS - SPACE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Enterprise is in orbit around Romulus.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Remus can be seen in the distance.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Captain's Log.
{DIALOGUE}: Stardate 47844.9.
{DIALOGUE}: The Enterprise has arrived at Romulus and is waiting at the designated coordinates.
{DIALOGUE}: All our hails have gone unanswered.
{DIALOGUE}: We've been waiting for seventeen hours.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crew is tense.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Silence.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Worf, at tactical, slowly stretches his neck.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Trying to release the tension.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It cracks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Deanna jumps a bit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: Why don't they answer our hails?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: It's an old psychological strategy, Number One.
{DIALOGUE}: To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: It's working.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (to Deanna)
{DIALOGUE}: Counselor?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: They're out there, sir.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard stands and walks to the viewscreen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He gazes at Romulus below and the black infinity of space beyond.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They're out there, Waiting.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Not yet, Mister Worf.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Patience.
{DIALOGUE}: Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation.
{DIALOGUE}: We can wait.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Captain...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And on the viewscreen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon's magnificent Reman Warbird, the SCIMITAR, decloaks directly before the Enterprise.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. OVER ROMULUS - SPACE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Our first sight of this incredible ship is absolutely breathtaking.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon's vessel combines the clean lines of the traditional Romulan Warbird with unique weaponry and styling.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is huge, easily twice as large as the Enterprise.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And it is aggressive.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Awesome in its power.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crew gapes at the huge ship on the viewscreen.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{META_DATA}: (slowly rising from his chair)
{DIALOGUE}: My God...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{META_DATA}: (tense)
{DIALOGUE}: Should I raise shields?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: No!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: Captain -- !
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (firm)
{DIALOGUE}: Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{META_DATA}: (quickly analyzing tactical display)
{DIALOGUE}: Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty- seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (grim)
{DIALOGUE}: She's a predator.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: We're being hailed.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: On screen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And the image on the viewscreen transforms to:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon's Viceroy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stands on the Scimitar's bridge.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The bridge is as unique as the rest of Shinzon's ship.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Instead of the usual mechanical clutter, this bridge is designed with an almost Asian simplicity.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Like the rest of Reman design, it is spare and elegant.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Since the Remans are more comfortable in the darkness, most of the light comes from the three steadily pulsing warp core relays which dramatically soar up through the floor of the bridge.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crew gazes at the bridge and the monstrous features of the viceroy.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICEROY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
{DIALOGUE}: Enterprise.
{DIALOGUE}: We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICEROY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
{DIALOGUE}: I am not Shinzon.
{DIALOGUE}: I am his Viceroy.
{DIALOGUE}: We are sending transport coordinates.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The transmission ends abruptly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Scimitar reappears on the viewscreen.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: Not very chatty.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Away team.
{DIALOGUE}: Transporter room four.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard, Riker, Deanna, Worf and Data head toward the turbolift, energized now that the endless waiting is over.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SCIMITAR - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The away team materializes in the most striking location on Shinzon's ship: a large observation lounge.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is a huge, empty chamber.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: No furniture.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A simple Reman mat on the floor is the only decoration.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: At the very top of the room there is a large, etched glass dome.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is very dark.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They turn when Shinzon speaks from the shadows:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Praetor Shinzon?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon moves toward them a bit, becoming slightly more illuminated, the low light shining off his golden hair.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crew cannot see him clearly in the dim light but it is evident he is human.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Assuming that he was Reman, they're surprised by this realization.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon just stares at Picard through the darkness for a moment.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Captain Picard... Jean Luc Picard... I don't mean to stare, it's just -- well, you can't imagine how long I've been waiting for this moment.
{DIALOGUE}: I always imagined you taller, isn't that odd?
{META_DATA}: (to Data)
{DIALOGUE}: You may scan me without subterfuge, Commander Data.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data scans him with a tricorder as:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: And you're not as we imagined you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: No?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: You are human.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Commander Worf.
{META_DATA}: (he speaks in Klingon)
{DIALOGUE}: I greet you as a valiant warrior... and as my brother.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{META_DATA}: (terse, in Klingon)
{DIALOGUE}: I'll save my greetings for a better brother.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon laughs, maniacally.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Why have you asked for our presence here?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon does not answer.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is staring deeply at Deanna, moans softly.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Praetor?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{META_DATA}: (quietly)
{DIALOGUE}: I've never met a human woman.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He slowly moves toward her, still hidden in the shadows.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: I'm only half human.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Deanna Troi of Betazed.
{DIALOGUE}: Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor.
{DIALOGUE}: All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: You seem very familiar with our personnel.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon moves even closer to Deanna, not taking his eyes from her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: I am, Commander Riker...
{META_DATA}: (to Deanna)
{DIALOGUE}: ... May I touch your hair?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (firm)
{DIALOGUE}: Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance.
{DIALOGUE}: If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon continues to stare at Deanna.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is strangely seductive.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Almost disquieting in its intensity.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Deanna handles it with grace, her level gaze never leaving his.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{META_DATA}: (softly)
{DIALOGUE}: On the world I come from there's no light.
{DIALOGUE}: No sun.
{DIALOGUE}: Beauty isn't important.
{DIALOGUE}: I see now there's a world elsewhere.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Praetor Shinzon.
{DIALOGUE}: We're not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{META_DATA}: (turning back to Picard)
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.
{META_DATA}: (he smiles)
{DIALOGUE}: There's so much we have to talk about.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Unity, Captain!
{DIALOGUE}: Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people.
{DIALOGUE}: Federation and Romulan.
{DIALOGUE}: Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same.
{DIALOGUE}: We want peace.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard and the others are stunned.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: I want to end the centuries of mistrust.
{DIALOGUE}: I want to be your ally, not your enemy.
{DIALOGUE}: As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: And the Senate supports you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{META_DATA}: (dry)
{DIALOGUE}: I have dissolved the Senate.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Right now, you're thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: And you're wondering why the Scimitar is so well armed.
{DIALOGUE}: Is this the ship of a peacemaker?
{DIALOGUE}: Or a predator?
{DIALOGUE}: (Picard is startled at Shinzon's choice of words) ... But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore.
{DIALOGUE}: Above all, you're trying to decide if you can trust me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion.
{DIALOGUE}: Computer, raise lighting four levels.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lights shoot up around the room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For the first time the crew can see Shinzon clearly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard actually gasps when he sees Shinzon's face.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The rest of the crew doesn't understand his reaction.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Allow me to tell you a story that I hope will clarify my position.
{DIALOGUE}: When I was very young I was stricken with an odd disease.
{DIALOGUE}: I developed a hyper-sensitivity to sound.
{DIALOGUE}: The slightest whisper caused me agony...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard watches him carefully.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Wary and strangely intense.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: No one knew what to do.
{DIALOGUE}: Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome.
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know of it, Captain?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: You know I do.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crew is dumbfounded at Picard's unusual reaction.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Then you know it's a very rare syndrome.
{DIALOGUE}: Genetic.
{DIALOGUE}: All the male members of my family had it.
{DIALOGUE}: Eventually I was treated.
{DIALOGUE}: Now I can hear as well as you can, Captain.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He steps toward Picard who holds his ground.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: I can see as well as you can.
{DIALOGUE}: I can feel everything you feel.
{META_DATA}: (He stops right before Picard)
{DIALOGUE}: In fact, I feel exactly what you feel.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't I, Jean Luc?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard stares at him with a mixture of realization and curiosity.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is as if Picard is looking into a strange, remembered mirror: Shinzon's face is nearly identical to his at that age.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Do you trust me now?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: We need to talk, just you and I.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow.
{DIALOGUE}: Just the two of us.
{DIALOGUE}: Or just the one of us.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: You know I need to verify this.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: I know.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crew is utterly confused.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Their confusion turns to outright shock when Shinzon calmly pulls out a Reman knife and cuts his arm, drawing a little blood.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He hands the knife to Data.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Tomorrow then, Captain.
{DIALOGUE}: We have so much to discuss.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard touches his communicator pin:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Picard to Enterprise.
{DIALOGUE}: Five to beam out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They dematerialize, the shimmering glow illuminating Shinzon's features.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard's eyes never leave Shinzon as the transporter effect ripples around him.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beverly stands with Picard, Riker and Deanna.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Reman knife is under a protonmicroscope and other medical readouts and analysis are visible.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{DIALOGUE}: There's no doubt, Captain.
{DIALOGUE}: Right down to your regressive strain of Shalaft's Syndrome.
{DIALOGUE}: He's a clone.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat as the confirmation sinks in.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: When was he... created?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{DIALOGUE}: About twenty-five years ago.
{DIALOGUE}: They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (touching head)
{DIALOGUE}: I think a skin cell's the more likely of the two.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: Why?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Believe me, Number One; I'm going to find out.
{DIALOGUE}: Contact Starfleet Command and inform them of the situation.
{DIALOGUE}: I need to know where the hell he came from.
{DIALOGUE}: Deanna.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He goes, Deanna following.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR - FOLLOWING
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy.
{DIALOGUE}: What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Is he sincere about wanting peace?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{META_DATA}: (she stops him)
{DIALOGUE}: Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than curious about you.
{DIALOGUE}: He very much wants to know you.
{META_DATA}: (she looks at him deeply)
{DIALOGUE}: The same way you want to know him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: How could I not?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are.
{DIALOGUE}: You should resist the urge to think you know him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: I not only know him, Deanna, I am him... and he is me!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He goes.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - RIKER AND DEANNA'S CABIN - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riker is hard at work over a series of padds.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He has been working for hours.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: Will, you need to rest.
{META_DATA}: (he continues to work)
{DIALOGUE}: As ship's counselor, I'm recommending you get me sleep.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riker tosses a padd on the desk.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Rubs his eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Looks up her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: Some honeymoon.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She smiles and goes to him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: We have time.
{META_DATA}: (she kisses him)
{DIALOGUE}: Come to bed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She pulls him up.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: Imzadi, what am I going to do with you?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They kiss deeply.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She pulls him across the room and they fall into the bed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is passionate, erotic.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Her arms undulate around him sensually... her fingers snake through his hair, but something is wrong.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riker's hair is now blond.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She starts back, her eyes growing wide.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riker is gone.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She is now embracing Shinzon!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Imzadi.
{DIALOGUE}: This is so good.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: No!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He caresses her face...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: This isn't real.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Can you feel my hands... are they real?
{DIALOGUE}: Can you feel my lips, my loins?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He kisses her neck -- but when he raises his head again.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is the monstrous Viceroy!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Holding her.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Caressing her.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She is frozen in horror.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But is it the Viceroy at all?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon's voice seems to come from the Viceroy's lips:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: I'm with you, Imzadi...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then it is Shinzon again, kissing her:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: I'll always be with you now.
{DIALOGUE}: Now and forever...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: You sick bastard!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She pushes him away...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: Deanna?!
{DIALOGUE}: What's with the name calling?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is Riker.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She stares at him, then clings to him desperately.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. ROMULAN SENATE - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Byzantine splendors of the Senate loom before us.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Heavy drapes are drawn against any hint of the sun.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon is in conference with the Romulan Commanders and Senator Tal'Aura.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Commander Donatra watches him closely.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Commander Suran is angry, pacing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon stands.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His Viceroy lurks in a corner.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SURAN
{DIALOGUE}: ... then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: You don't have to understand.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SURAN
{DIALOGUE}: And bringing the Enterprise here?!
{DIALOGUE}: What possible purpose could that serve?!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: I have a purpose.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SURAN
{DIALOGUE}: Then perhaps you will enlighten us?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{META_DATA}: (snaps)
{DIALOGUE}: Silence, Romulan!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A tense beat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon regains his composure.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: You must learn patience, Commander.
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know where I learned it?
{DIALOGUE}: In the dilithium mines of Remus.
{DIALOGUE}: Spend eighteen hours every day under the lash of a Romulan guard's whip and you'll soon understand patience.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SURAN
{META_DATA}: (carefully bows his head)
{DIALOGUE}: Praetor.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Now go.
{DIALOGUE}: I have some personal business.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suran and the others go.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Donatra turns just as she is leaving the chamber, she sees the Viceroy going to Shinzon.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And then do something odd.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon's chest, leans very close and talks to him quietly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is an ancient form of Reman telepathic medical diagnosis.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This strange sight perplexes Donatra.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The doors close, blocking her view...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SENATE - CORRIDOR - FOLLOWING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We go with Donatra and the other Romulans.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Donatra speaks quietly to Suran:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DONATRA
{DIALOGUE}: How long before he has us in the dilithium mines?
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - DATA'S CABIN - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The B-9 sits placidly in a chair, staring forward.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then, as if a switch was thrown, he moves.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He quickly rises and goes to a computer console.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He efficiently starts punching in commands at an amazing velocity.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard and Shinzon sit alone in a corner of the sweeping Senate chamber.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The remains of dinner before them.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate.
{DIALOGUE}: Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to influence your command structure.
{DIALOGUE}: It was a bold plan.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: What happened?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: As happens so frequently here on Romulus, a new government came to power.
{DIALOGUE}: They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly, I think they were afraid I'd be discovered and it would lead to war.
{DIALOGUE}: They weren't ready for that.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard pours a glass of Romulan ale.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Romulan ale -- I'm surprised.
{DIALOGUE}: I can't stand it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (smiles)
{DIALOGUE}: You'll acquire a taste for it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They look at each other.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: It's not quite the face you remember.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Not quite.
{DIALOGUE}: I envy the hairline.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: A lifetime of violence will do that.
{DIALOGUE}: My nose was broken four times.
{DIALOGUE}: And my jaw... But so much is the same.
{DIALOGUE}: The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{DIALOGUE}: The eyes have it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they?
{DIALOGUE}: Yours are so confident.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: How did you end up on Remus?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: They sent me there to die.
{DIALOGUE}: How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines?
{DIALOGUE}: It was...
{META_DATA}: (he can't find the words)
{DIALOGUE}: ... I was a slave.
{DIALOGUE}: And a monster.
{DIALOGUE}: The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me.
{DIALOGUE}: But one man took pity on me: the man who became my Viceroy.
{DIALOGUE}: He taught me how to survive.
{DIALOGUE}: And in that dark place, where there was nothing of myself, I found my Reman brothers.
{DIALOGUE}: They showed me the only kindness I ever knew.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He glances to the Romulan crest on the wall.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister- planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: No race should be a slave to another.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard is impressed with Shinzon's quiet words.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: You don't trust me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: I have no reason to.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Of course you do.
{DIALOGUE}: If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... you'd be sitting where I am now.
{DIALOGUE}: At least I hope you would.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great responsibility in representing the Federation.
{DIALOGUE}: I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: All I have is my personal feelings.
{DIALOGUE}: I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation.
{DIALOGUE}: But I'm trying to understand them now.
{DIALOGUE}: To live up to them To live up to you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: I want to know where I come from.
{DIALOGUE}: The Remans gave me a future.
{DIALOGUE}: You can tell me about my past.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Were we always explorers?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PlCARD
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: I was the first Picard to leave Earth.
{DIALOGUE}: It caused quite a stir, In fact.
{DIALOGUE}: But I had spent my whole life...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{META_DATA}: (finishing the sentence)
{DIALOGUE}: Looking up at the stars.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON

{DIALOGUE}: About...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (finishing the sentence)
{DIALOGUE}: New worlds.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They both reach for a carafe of water at the exact same instant.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Stop.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: After you, Praetor.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{META_DATA}: (smiles)
{DIALOGUE}: Age before rank, Jean Luc.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard smiles, pours a glass.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: So I'm not as tall as you expected?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: I always hoped I would hit two meters.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: With a full head of hair.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{META_DATA}: (smiles)
{DIALOGUE}: There is that.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A quiet beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: I know.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united.
{DIALOGUE}: From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace.
{DIALOGUE}: Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friendship.
{DIALOGUE}: In time.
{DIALOGUE}: When trust has been earned.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: In time, Jean Luc.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: In time.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SENATE CHAMBER - LATER
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard is gone.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon sits, thinking.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His Viceroy enters.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICEROY
{DIALOGUE}: This is a mistake.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: He's gentler than I thought.
{DIALOGUE}: And he has a sense of humor.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICEROY
{META_DATA}: (stern)
{DIALOGUE}: Don't forget our mission, Shinzon.
{DIALOGUE}: We should act.
{DIALOGUE}: Now.
{DIALOGUE}: Time is running out.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{META_DATA}: (snaps)
{DIALOGUE}: My time.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll spend it how I choose.

{DIALOGUE}: We'll return to the Scimitar.
{DIALOGUE}: Prepare yourself for the bonding.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard emerges from the turbolift.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data, Worf and Geordi wait at the bridge engineering station.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Who was it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: What programs were accessed?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations.
{DIALOGUE}: It's not even restricted material.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (to Worf)
{DIALOGUE}: Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting.
{DIALOGUE}: If it happens again, we want to be ready.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{META_DATA}: (grim)
{DIALOGUE}: There's something else.
{DIALOGUE}: I was reviewing the sensor logs...
{META_DATA}: (he refers to some readouts on his console)
{DIALOGUE}: When the Scimitar decloaked there was a momentary spike in the tertiary EM band -- there -- You're not going to believe this but it's Thalaron.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard is shocked.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SICKBAY - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard stands, concerned, with Beverly, Geordi and Data.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Monitors showing Thalaron research are visible.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: ... I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up.
{DIALOGUE}: But he's got it, Captain.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{DIALOGUE}: It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level.
{DIALOGUE}: I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc.
{DIALOGUE}: A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Understood.
{DIALOGUE}: Keep on it.
{DIALOGUE}: I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat.
{DIALOGUE}: Give me options.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard goes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data thinks for a moment.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Doctor, will you excuse us for a moment?

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She sits, notes the picture of Young Jean Luc.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Remember him?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{DIALOGUE}: He was a bit proud as I recall.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: He was a damn fool.
{DIALOGUE}: Selfish and ambitious.
{DIALOGUE}: Very much in need of seasoning.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{DIALOGUE}: He turned out all right.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He rises, goes to a window, gazes at the Scimitar in the distance.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: I so wanted to believe Shinzon.
{DIALOGUE}: But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away.
{DIALOGUE}: Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{DIALOGUE}: Is he very much like you were?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data interrupts on comm:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA (V.O.) (ON COMM)
{DIALOGUE}: Data to Captain Picard.
{DIALOGUE}: Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access.
{DIALOGUE}: And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (to comm)
{DIALOGUE}: On my way...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{META_DATA}: (stands)
{DIALOGUE}: Jean Luc -- whatever you were -- right now you're the man you've made yourself.
{DIALOGUE}: He's someone else.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He goes.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - TURBOLIFT - MORNING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Deanna is alone on the turbolift.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then a voice makes her spin:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Imzadi...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon stands across from her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: You're not here.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{META_DATA}: (moving to her)
{DIALOGUE}: Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He pushes her against the wall, with passion and almost violence.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: No...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: I can feel your desire, Deanna...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She forces herself to concentrate... to resist telepathically... it is a mighty effort... this Romulan is hot.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And the world around her appears to be changing... bending...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And she is momentarily in a cabin on the Scimitar.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Although entirely a telepathic experience, it is as if she has actually traveled.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She sees Shinzon kneeling over a small flame, she realizes she is looking through the Viceroy's eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On the Scimitar, Shinzon looks up at the Viceroy/Deanna:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: I can feel your hunger to know the Reman ways... the old ways.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then the world changes again...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Deanna is on the turbolift.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon is pressed against her, whispering:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Don't fear what you desire...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She forces him away from her and --

{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Find her again.

{DIALOGUE}: No -- this is wasting time.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Do as I tell you!

{CHARACTER_NAME}: REMAN OFFICER (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{META_DATA}: (to comm)
{DIALOGUE}: On my way.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He begins to go -- but suddenly stops, a wave of illness overtaking him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon's chest.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A strange moment as the Viceroy shuts his eyes and feels Shinzon's chest.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His mind... probing.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then the Viceroy looks up at him, grim.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICEROY
{DIALOGUE}: It's accelerating.
{DIALOGUE}: You have no more time for games.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Have the doctors prepare.
{DIALOGUE}: I'll be on the bridge.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He goes.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon stands with some REMAN ENGINEERS.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Transport.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: An Engineer activates a transporter and the B-9 materializes!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Welcome home.
{META_DATA}: (to Engineers)
{DIALOGUE}: Begin the download.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Reman engineers go to the B-9 and open the panel in his neck, begin connecting computer conduits to the extra memory port we saw earlier.
{META_DATA}: (Note: Although the audience will not know it yet, this is actually Data pretending to be the B-9.)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon goes to a replicator unit and orders:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Tea, hot.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He takes it and sips as he watches his Engineers connecting the conduits to the B-9.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beverly is scanning Deanna.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard and Riker watch, concerned.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (gently)
{DIALOGUE}: Can you describe it, Deanna?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She looks at Picard, tears in her eyes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: It was... a violation.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riker takes her hand.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{META_DATA}: (with difficulty)
{DIALOGUE}: Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts.
{DIALOGUE}: I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Permission denied.
{DIALOGUE}: If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.
{DIALOGUE}: I need you at my side.
{DIALOGUE}: Now more than ever I..
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But before the words are out of his mouth... he begins to dematerialize!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{META_DATA}: (to comm)
{DIALOGUE}: Worf!
{DIALOGUE}: Raise Shields !
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But Picard is gone.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. OVER ROMULUS - SPACE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Scimitar cloaks.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SCIMITAR - BRIG - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard stands in the Reman brig. His communicator pin has been removed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beyond the security force field a ghoulish medical apparatus is being prepared.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A metal chair with laser scalpels, IV tubes and hyposprays connected to it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Reman doctors work over the mysterious chair.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon enters with the B-9 following.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon stands on the other side of the force field.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard notices something immediately.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Tiny veins are now visible on Shinzon's face; the faintest sign of an intricate spider-web pattern of pale blue veins.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Hello, Jean Luc.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Why am I here?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: I was lonely... (he realizes Picard is staring at the veins on his face) Perhaps I'm not aging as well as you did.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He nods to a guard.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The guard deactivates the force field.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A Reman doctor enters and raises a hypospray toward Picard.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (resists)
{DIALOGUE}: What are you doing?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: I need a sample of your blood.
{DIALOGUE}: What do your Borg friends say?
{DIALOGUE}: Resistance is futile.
{META_DATA}: (maniacal laugh)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Doctor takes a quick sample of Picard's blood as Picard glances to the B-9.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{DIALOGUE}: The bait you couldn't refuse.
{DIALOGUE}: I learned there might be an existing prototype from a Cardassian historian, then went to a great deal of trouble to find it and scatter it about on Kolarus III.
{DIALOGUE}: I knew it would pique your curiosity and conveniently make the Enterprise the closest ship to Romulus when I contacted Starfleet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Reman doctor leaves the cell.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The force field is reactivated.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The doctor goes to the mysterious medical apparatus and analyzes Picard's blood.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: All of this so you could capture me?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Don't be so vain.
{DIALOGUE}: After we found it, we made a few modifications.
{DIALOGUE}: An extra memory port, a hidden transponder.
{DIALOGUE}: Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols.
{DIALOGUE}: I now know the location of your entire fleet...
{META_DATA}: (to B-9)
{DIALOGUE}: ... You may go.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{DIALOGUE}: Where?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Out of my sight.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The B-9 obediently leaves the room as:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.
{DIALOGUE}: Or maybe I'll snap its ugly head off.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: What's this all about?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: It's about destiny, Picard.
{DIALOGUE}: About a Reman outcast who --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: You're not Reman.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: And I'm not quite human.
{DIALOGUE}: So what am I?
{DIALOGUE}: What do you see?
{META_DATA}: (he peers at Picard deeply)
{DIALOGUE}: Do you see a life you might have led?
{DIALOGUE}: Lost youth never to be recaptured?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do.
{DIALOGUE}: I see the man I will never be.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: I won't defend my life to you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: My life is meaningless as long as you're alive.
{DIALOGUE}: What am I while you exist?
{DIALOGUE}: A shadow?
{DIALOGUE}: An enigma?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (stern)
{DIALOGUE}: If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Oh, but it does.
{DIALOGUE}: We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone.
{DIALOGUE}: Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation.
{DIALOGUE}: We're a race bred for war.
{DIALOGUE}: For conquest.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Think about what you're doing, Shinzon.
{DIALOGUE}: Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: It amazes me how little you know yourself.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: I think the facts speak for themselves.
{DIALOGUE}: The same noble Picard blood runs in our veins.
{DIALOGUE}: Had you lived my life, you'd be doing exactly as I am.
{DIALOGUE}: Look in the mirror, and see yourself.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon looks at him deeply.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Consider that, Captain.
{DIALOGUE}: I can think of no greater torment for you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He turns to go.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: It's a mirror for you as well...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon turns back to him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard gazes at him evenly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard's probing gaze makes Shinzon a bit uneasy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He glances to the ghoulish medical preparations.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Not for long, Captain.
{META_DATA}: (back to Picard)
{DIALOGUE}: I'm afraid you won't survive to witness the victory of the echo over the voice.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He goes.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The ship is on Red Alert.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Worf stands at tactical, muscles coiled, hungry for action.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi is hard at work at the Science station.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riker stands over him:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{META_DATA}: (frustrated)
{DIALOGUE}: His cloak is perfect... no tachyon emissions, no residual antiprotons.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: Keep at it, Geordi.
{DIALOGUE}: Find a way in.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beverly arrives on the bridge, urgent.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Viceroy turns his malevolent gaze on Picard.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICEROY
{DIALOGUE}: So, human... you've met your better self!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICEROY
{DIALOGUE}: I'm preparing her for Shinzon... To sooth him as she soothes you.
{DIALOGUE}: To stand at his side as she does at yours.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: That will never happen.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICEROY
{DIALOGUE}: Listen to him, android.
{DIALOGUE}: Such a small and weak creature.
{DIALOGUE}: Yet he roars so valiantly... (he raises one taloned claw and puts a sharp fingernail on Picard's chest) It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: There'll be another after me.
{DIALOGUE}: And another after that.
{DIALOGUE}: You'll find we're a resilient species.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICEROY
{DIALOGUE}: I look forward to the sport.
{META_DATA}: (to the B-9, harshly)
{DIALOGUE}: Take him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The B-9 prods Picard's back roughly with the disruptor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard grimaces in pain
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{DIALOGUE}: Move.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The B-9 leads Picard along.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (whispers)
{DIALOGUE}: Be careful of over-playing your part, Commander!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And the audience now realizes it is Data pretending to be the B-9 and rejoices.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Sorry, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: I thought it added a touch of reality to the performance.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are silent as they pass a few Reman guards.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: My mission was a success, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Good work.
{DIALOGUE}: The download?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: He believes he has our communications protocols.
{DIALOGUE}: But they will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data assumes the B-9's posture again as they pass some some Reman Warriors.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Move, puny human animal.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They pass the Warriors.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: A bit less florid, Data.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The whole, cavernous chamber pulses with glowing green light.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: This entire ship is, essentially, a flying Thalaron generator.
{META_DATA}: (he points up)
{DIALOGUE}: All its power relays lead to that device.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: High above them, at the very top of the chamber, is a gigantic version of the spider-weapon we saw kill all the Romulan Senators before.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It is breathtaking.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: A weapon.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: It would appear so.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data rotates his left hand and then slides it forward, exposing a hidden compartment in his wrist.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He removes a small, silver disc.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is a cool new piece of Federation technology called an ETU.
{META_DATA}: (Emergency Transport Unit.)
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit.
{DIALOGUE}: I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: It'll only work for one of us.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, sir.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: We'll find a way off together.
{DIALOGUE}: Recommendations?

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: -- Data fires the disruptor as Picard launches himself into them --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A fight -- Picard uses a dazzlinq series of Starfleet hand- to-hand maneuvers -- he dramatically subdues the Remans.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: More Reman warriors appear down the corridor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard grabs a disruptor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And instantly spins to fire a blazing disruptor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A battle breaks out in the corridor -- the energy beams and explosions illuminating the violent fire fight in strobe-like bursts.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They run to another corridor and finally arrive at the shuttlebay door -- it does not open.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{META_DATA}: (looking at door security panel)
{DIALOGUE}: It seems to have an encrypted security system.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Reman warriors are closing in on them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data tosses his disruptor to Picard -- Picard catches it and instantly spins and fires -- he uses both disruptors to fire down both ends of the corridor like a Western sheriff -- keeping the Remans at bay --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As Data uses both hands to punch numbers into the shuttlebay door security panel at an amazing rate --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: They are trying to override the access codes.
{DIALOGUE}: Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: While I find that fascinating, Data, we really need that Goddamned door open!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The shuttlebay door slides open.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard lays down a blistering barrage of cover fire as he and Data duck into the shuttlebay.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SCIMITAR - SHUTTLEBAY - FOLLOWING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When the door closes behind them, Picard turns and fires a disruptor blast -- sealing the door mechanism.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They turn to face...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A fleet of very small shuttles.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They are uniquely designed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Extremely compact and stream-lined.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A disruptor turret on each.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They move toward one as:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: According to the ship's manifest they are Scorpion-class attack fliers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They quickly climb a Scorpion.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SCORPION COCKPIT - SHUTTLEBAY - FOLLOWING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The cockpit of the Scorpion is cramped.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard climbs into the pilot's position.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data assumes the gunner's position.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They see disruptor fire trying to burn through the door to the shuttlebay -- Picard powers up the Scorpion as:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (trying to figure out the controls)
{DIALOGUE}: What do you imagine this is?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Port thrusters, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: Would you like me to drive?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard shoots him a look and presses some controls.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Scorpion lifts off.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hovers a few feet over the deck.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard elegantly swings it around toward the large shuttlebay external doors as:
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Can you open the shuttlebay doors?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{META_DATA}: (working controls)
{DIALOGUE}: Affirmative, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: Negative, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Well then... only one way to go.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He swings the Scorpion around again so it is facing the doors they came through, the doors back into the ship.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data is dubious.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Do you think this is a wise course of action?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Ready, Captain.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Fire!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And the Scorpion's forward disruptors fire!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The doors into the ship explode!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard powers forward!
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SCIMITAR CORRIDORS - FOLLOWING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And the Scorpion shoots into the corridor, past the stunned Remans.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard banks sharply -- careens off the far side of the corridor but keeps control.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Scorpion zooms down the corridor.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SCORPION COCKPIT - SCIMITAR - FOLLOWING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard is concentrating intensely -- it is like trying to control the world's fastest roller coaster.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SCIMITAR - CORRIDORS - FOLLOWING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Scorpion banks around a corner --it zigs and zags through the ship at breakneck speed --
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SCIMITAR - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The doors to the observation lounge EXPLODE in.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Scorpion SHOOTS into the room and up --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A disruptor blast SHATTERS the etched glass dome at the top of the room --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And the Scorpion ZOOMS triumphantly into space!
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. OVER ROMULUS - SPACE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Scorpion seems to appear from nowhere -- slicing through the cloak of invisibility around the Scimitar --
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The crew sees the Scorpion appear on the viewscreen.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: Worf!
{DIALOGUE}: Lock on transporters!
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SCIMITAR BRIDGE - FOLLOWING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon sees the Scorpion as well.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Tractor beam!
{DIALOGUE}: Now!
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. OVER ROMULUS - SPACE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But they are too late -- the Scorpion dematerializes --
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - CARGO BAY - FOLLOWING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And materializes in one of the Enterprise's cargo bays.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard and Data climb out --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (to comm)
{DIALOGUE}: Number One, emergency warp!
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. OVER ROMULUS - FOLLOWING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Enterprise dramatically powers forward and up -- rolling over in a great arc going into warp while still upside down.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It disappears in a blaze of light.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Fade to...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon sits in his command chair as the ship streaks through space.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He speaks on viewscreen with his Romulan collaborators.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His face is even more finely veined now.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: The Enterprise is immaterial!
{DIALOGUE}: They won't make it back to Federation space.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
{META_DATA}: (angry)
{DIALOGUE}: This has gone far enough!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
{DIALOGUE}: And mine is wearing thin, young man!
{DIALOGUE}: We supported you because you promised action.
{DIALOGUE}: And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon stands and briskly pulls down his uniform tunic exactly as we've seen Picard do a thousand times.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Commander Suran, the games are over.
{DIALOGUE}: In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair.
{DIALOGUE}: Does that satisfy you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
{META_DATA}: (grim)
{DIALOGUE}: For the moment.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{META_DATA}: (brutal)
{DIALOGUE}: And when I return... you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect!
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ROMULAN SENATE - CHAMBER - FOLLOWING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The viewscreen picture of Shinzon snaps out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Romulan sit for a silent beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DONATRA
{DIALOGUE}: Does anyone in this room harbor any illusions about what he means by "showing proper respect"?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: TAL'AURA
{DIALOGUE}: What's happening to his face?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SURAN
{DIALOGUE}: I want opinions.
{DIALOGUE}: He is clearly out of his mind.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SURAN
{DIALOGUE}: But can he complete his mission?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DONATRA
{DIALOGUE}: Should he?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They look at her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DONATRA
{DIALOGUE}: Are you prepared to have your hands drenched in blood?
{DIALOGUE}: He'll show them no mercy.
{DIALOGUE}: And his sins will mark us all for generations.
{DIALOGUE}: Is that what you truly want, Romulans?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DONATRA
{DIALOGUE}: I think you should consider that question now -- or else you may have a lifetime to think about it in the dilithium mines.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She turns and stalks out.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beverly sits with Picard and Riker.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{DIALOGUE}: The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got.
{DIALOGUE}: Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing.
{DIALOGUE}: He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: But the Romulans abandoned the plan...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{DIALOGUE}: As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated.
{DIALOGUE}: Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age.
{DIALOGUE}: He was engineered to skip thirty years of life.
{DIALOGUE}: But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down.
{DIALOGUE}: He's dying.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Dying?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PlCARD
{DIALOGUE}: Can anything be done for him?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{DIALOGUE}: Not without a complete myelodysplastic infusion from the only donor with compatible DNA.
{DIALOGUE}: But that would mean draining all your blood.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: That's why he went to all that trouble to capture you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PlCARD
{DIALOGUE}: How long does he have?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{DIALOGUE}: I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard considers this.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Then he'll come for me as a donor.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - DATA'S CABIN - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data stands before the B-9.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The B-9 has been deactivated, he stands lifeless and immobile.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data gazes deeply into his double's identical features.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he opens a panel in the B-9's neck and uses a small instrument to activate the android's head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The B-9's eyes spring to life.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks at Data.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{DIALOGUE}: Brother.
{DIALOGUE}: I cannot move.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{DIALOGUE}: Why?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Because you are dangerous.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{DIALOGUE}: Why?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{DIALOGUE}: I do not understand.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: I know.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abilities of his ship?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: Can I move now?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: I must deactivate you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{DIALOGUE}: For how long?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Indefinitely.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B-9
{DIALOGUE}: How long is that?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data gazes at the B-9 deeply.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: A long time, brother.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data reaches forward and deactivates his brother.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The B-9's eyes lose the spark of life.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stands, frozen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data stands before him.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard is gathered with his senior officers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A computer display illustrates Geordi's words about the power of Shinzon's weapon.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see a chilling graphic of the Biogenic Pulse beam spreading around a ship, then a whole planet.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: It's called a Cascading Biogenic Pulse.
{DIALOGUE}: The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits.
{DIALOGUE}: Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (thinking)
{DIALOGUE}: And that's exactly what he's going to do.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: Sir?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: His hatred of the Federation is apparent.
{DIALOGUE}: He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason.
{DIALOGUE}: He is going after Earth.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: Oh boy.
{DIALOGUE}: Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: And the Romulans invade.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEANNA
{DIALOGUE}: How can you be certain?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: I know how he thinks.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{META_DATA}: (to Geordi)
{DIALOGUE}: And there's no way to penetrate his cloak?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: No, sir.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{META_DATA}: (frustrated)
{DIALOGUE}: He could pass within 10 meters of every ship in Starfleet and they'd never know.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{DIALOGUE}: But we do have one advantage.
{META_DATA}: (to Picard)
{DIALOGUE}: He needs your blood to live.
{DIALOGUE}: He might come after you first.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274.
{DIALOGUE}: Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: Strength in numbers?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: We can only hope so.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat as he looks at them gravely.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: He can't be allowed to use that weapon.
{DIALOGUE}: All other concerns are secondary.
{DIALOGUE}: Do you understand me?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riker knows exactly what Picard is saying: the Enterprise is expendable.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, sir.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard stands.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Presses a comm button.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD

{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD (V.O.)
{DIALOGUE}: Captain's Personal Log.
{DIALOGUE}: Supplemental.
{DIALOGUE}: We're heading toward Federation space at maximum warp.
{DIALOGUE}: The crew has responded with the dedication I've come to expect of them.
{DIALOGUE}: And like a thousand other commanders on a thousand other battlefields throughout history, I wait for the dawn.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The montage ends as...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - NIGHT

{META_DATA}: (quietly)
{DIALOGUE}: To seek out new life and new civilizations.
{DIALOGUE}: Zephyr Cochran's own words.
{DIALOGUE}: When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{META_DATA}: (gently)
{DIALOGUE}: That was another time.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD

{DIALOGUE}: Let me know if you need anything.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He starts to go --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{DIALOGUE}: Jean Luc...
{META_DATA}: (he stops)
{DIALOGUE}: ... He is not you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: What makes us who we are, Doctor?
{DIALOGUE}: Can you tell me that?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She watches him go.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SCIMITAR BRIDGE - NIGHT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon sits in his command chair, lined with veins now.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His Viceroy again has his hand pressed to Shinzon's chest.

{DIALOGUE}: How long?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICEROY
{DIALOGUE}: A matter of hours now --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon shoves him away.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Stands.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICEROY
{DIALOGUE}: If you don't begin the procedure soon you'll never make it back to Romulus.
{DIALOGUE}: You shouldn't have delayed.
{DIALOGUE}: You should have killed Picard the moment --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon slams his command chair in fury.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Viceroy watches him carefully.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon regains his composure.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He sits again in his command chair.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: How long until we reach the Rift?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: VICEROY
{META_DATA}: (checks a console)
{DIALOGUE}: Seven minutes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Shinzon leans back, satisfied.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The images before them quickly change to show another sector and a blip representing the Enterprise.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: How long until we reach the fleet?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The images before them change to show sector 3274.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see blips denoting Starfleet ships moving into position.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard gazes at the projection of stars before them for a moment.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (quietly)
{DIALOGUE}: "For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Of you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: I do not agree.
{DIALOGUE}: Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: But so much is the same.
{DIALOGUE}: On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do.
{DIALOGUE}: I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: He would deny a "human" connection is possible.
{DIALOGUE}: He considers himself entirely Reman.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: No, sir, it is not possible.
{DIALOGUE}: The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced.
{DIALOGUE}: But even if they were, he would not be me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: How can you be sure?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: I aspire, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: To be better than I am.
{DIALOGUE}: The B-9 does not.
{DIALOGUE}: Nor does Shinzon.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A beat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: We'll never know what Shinzon might have been.
{DIALOGUE}: Had he stood where I did as a child?
{DIALOGUE}: And looked up at the stars.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard's words linger in the air for a moment.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then the projections before them sputter with static for a moment.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Flickering.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{META_DATA}: (working controls)
{DIALOGUE}: We are passing through the Bassen Rift.
{DIALOGUE}: The projections will return when we have cleared it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: The Rift effects all long-range communications --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (urgent, to comm)

{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Can you learn to see in the dark, Captain?
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard and Data emerge from the turbolift as the ship ROCKS --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Report.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: He's firing through his cloak.
{DIALOGUE}: We can't get a lock.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{META_DATA}: (at engineering station)
{DIALOGUE}: He disabled our warp drive with his first shot.
{DIALOGUE}: We've only got impulse.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: Long range communication is impossible as long as we're in the rift --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The ship SHUDDERS again --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation.
{DIALOGUE}: All banks on my mark.
{DIALOGUE}: Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: Aye, sir
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The ship ROCKS again.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Fire!
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. THE RIFT - SPACE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Enterprise fires her phasers simultaneously -- the energy beams shoot into space --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And the Scimitar's shape is momentarily illuminated as one of its shields is hit.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Photon torpedoes immediately shoot from the Enterprise -- but pass harmlessly through the area where the Scimitar's shields were momentarily illuminated.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: You're too slow, old man.
{META_DATA}: (entering commands in his chair console)
{DIALOGUE}: Attack pattern Shinzon Theta.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. THE RIFT - SPACE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The invisible Warbird makes a dramatic run straight over the Enterprise -- firing steadily down as it sweeps past it; is a brutal, close range assault --
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The bridge SHAKES violently under the ruthless attack--
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: We are losing dorsal shields --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Full axis rotation to port!
{DIALOGUE}: Fire all ventral phasers!
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. THE RIFT - SPACE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Enterprise instantly complies -- Rolling completely over to the left, firing phasers up as Shinzon's invisible ship streaks above it --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A few lucky phaser shots from the bottom of the Enterprise -- now shooting upward -- manage to momentarily illuminate the bottom shields of the Scimitar as it sweeps past above.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard stands in his Ready Room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A flickering light shimmers across the room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And a perfect holographic representation of Shinzon appears before him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captain.
{DIALOGUE}: So don't bother.
{DIALOGUE}: And you can't contact Starfleet.
{DIALOGUE}: We're quite alone.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: We are.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Why are you here?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: To accept your surrender.
{DIALOGUE}: I can clearly destroy you at any time.
{DIALOGUE}: Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: And what of the Enterprise?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain.
{DIALOGUE}: If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: You know that's not possible.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (intense)
{DIALOGUE}: Look at me, Shinzon!
{DIALOGUE}: Do you feel the blood pumping inside you?
{DIALOGUE}: Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine.
{DIALOGUE}: Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten.
{DIALOGUE}: It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us.
{DIALOGUE}: To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard looks at him deeply, relentlessly refusing to give up.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon.
{DIALOGUE}: There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{META_DATA}: (quietly)
{DIALOGUE}: Long ago.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Not so long.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SHINZON
{DIALOGUE}: Childish dreams, Captain.
{DIALOGUE}: Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus.
