{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: As before, Chekov and Scotty staring at the sky.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTTY
{META_DATA}: (concerned)
{DIALOGUE}: Repelling the Crystalline Trench... rafting down lava flows... orbital skydiving.

{META_DATA}: (re: sound)
{DIALOGUE}: That should be him now.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Scotty and Chekov move to him.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 6A EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The tumbling bottle rushes past, and we can now see that it is a CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE - Dom Perignon, 2265.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 6B EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk, Scotty and Chekov as before.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: Tomorrow I want to make a tri- elliptical jump.
{DIALOGUE}: That's where you jump out over Northern China, and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHEKOV
{DIALOGUE}: Captain.
{DIALOGUE}: Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This strikes a nerve with Kirk -- we see a flash of hesitation and irritation cross his face.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not going.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Scotty, help me with this chute.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTTY

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The camera is a holographic recorder with two lenses and is worn on an operator's head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There are four JOURNALISTS clustered in front of the Turbolift -- one associated with the camera, the others using PADDS to make notations.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Also clustered around the door are the BRIDGE CREW of the Enterprise-B.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOURNALISTS
{META_DATA}: (overlapping)
{DIALOGUE}: Captain Kirk, how does it feel to be back on the Enterprise Bridge... Captain, can I have a Minute... Captain Scott, do you have any comment on... Commander Chekov... etc.

{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: I remember reading about your missions when I was in grade school.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The original Enterprise officers all stop and give him a look.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Harriman looks a little embarrassed -- he didn't mean to insult them.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But Kirk gives him a little smile, lets it roll off.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: Well... may we have a look around?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRIMAN
{DIALOGUE}: Please... please.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chekov sees someone in the background, calls out to her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHEKOV
{DIALOGUE}: Demora!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chekov moves off.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOURNALIST
{META_DATA}: (breezy)
{DIALOGUE}: So, Captain... this is the first Starship Enterprise in thirty years without James T. Kirk in command.
{DIALOGUE}: How do you feel about that?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Journalist has unknowingly touched a nerve.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk's eyes flash for a moment -- the longer he's on this Bridge, the more he realizes he doesn't feel good about it at all.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He tries to shrug it off with a smile.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: Just fine.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm glad to be here to send her on her way...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He tries to move away from the Journalist, who dogs him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: JOURNALIST
{DIALOGUE}: What have you been doing since you retired?

{DIALOGUE}: It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: My father's told me some... interesting stories about you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk is shocked.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For a long moment, he stares at her in amazement.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: Your father... Hikaru Sulu is your father?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEMORA
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, sir.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHEKOV
{DIALOGUE}: You met her once before, but she was...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chekov holds out his hand and indicates a very short height.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: But that wasn't so long ago... it couldn't have been more than...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHEKOV
{DIALOGUE}: Twelve years, sir.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: Yes... well... congratulations, Ensign.
{DIALOGUE}: It wouldn't be the Enterprise without a Sulu at the helm.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEMORA
{DIALOGUE}: Thank you, sir.
{META_DATA}: (to Chekov)
{DIALOGUE}: Let me show you the new inertial guidance system.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Demora and Chekov move off and Kirk looks after them for a long beat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The expression on his face changes from shock to sadness... Something is clearly bothering him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Scotty moves over to Kirk, with a smile on his face.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTTY
{META_DATA}: (to Kirk)
{DIALOGUE}: Damn fine ship if you ask me...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But Kirk's mind is still on Demora.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He watches her as she moves to the Helmsman's position.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: You know, Scotty... it amazes me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTTY
{DIALOGUE}: And what would that be, sir?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: Sulu.
{DIALOGUE}: When did he find the time for a family?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTTY
{DIALOGUE}: It's like you always said -- if something's important enough, you make the time.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk nods absently.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Scotty realizes something...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTTY
{DIALOGUE}: So... that's why you've been running around the galaxy like an eighteen-year-old.
{DIALOGUE}: Finding retirement a little lonely, are we?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk gives him a look.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: With that kind of tact, I'm glad you're an engineer and not a psychiatrist.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Harriman interrupts.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRIMAN
{DIALOGUE}: Excuse me, gentlemen... if you'll take your seats.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: Oh... of course.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: No... no.
{DIALOGUE}: Thank you.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRIMAN
{DIALOGUE}: Please, I insist.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: All eyes on Kirk -- he has little choice.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He stands uncomfortably.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is a moment of anticipation.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{META_DATA}: (to all)
{DIALOGUE}: Take us out.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The great ship majestically LEAVES the dock, and heads out into open space, passing DIRECTLY OVERHEAD.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 12 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A short time later.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Harriman turns to his guests.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRIMAN
{DIALOGUE}: Well... we've just cleared the asteroid belt.
{DIALOGUE}: Our course will take us out beyond Pluto and then back to spacedock.
{DIALOGUE}: Just a quick run around the block.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: If we have time, we'll conduct a few tests of the warp --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly the communications console starts to BEEP.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The COM OFFICER hits a few commands in response.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COM OFFICER
{META_DATA}: (to Harriman)
{DIALOGUE}: We're picking up a distress call, Captain.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This grabs everyone's attention.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRIMAN
{DIALOGUE}: On speakers.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We hear the voice of a crewmember who sounds panicked and urgent.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: COM VOICE
{META_DATA}: (fritzed)
{DIALOGUE}: This is the transport ship Lakul.
{DIALOGUE}: We're caught in some kind of energy distortion.
{DIALOGUE}: We can't break free... need immediate help... It' tearing us --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The voice is drowned out by STATIC.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The SCIENCE OFFICER checks something on his console.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Journalist with the Holo-camera turns on his light and pans it around to capture the action.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCIENCE OFFICER
{DIALOGUE}: The Lakul is one of two ships transporting El-Aurian refugees to Earth.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Harriman blinks a couple of times, surprised at this unexpected turn of events.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEMORA
{DIALOGUE}: The ships are bearing at three one zero mark two one five.
{DIALOGUE}: Distance: Three light years.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The NAVIGATOR checks his console.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NAVIGATOR
{DIALOGUE}: We're the only one in range, sir.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Holo-camera light is shined on Harriman as he shifts in his seat, hesitant to take the plunge.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk is drumming his fingers impatiently on his leg.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Finally, Harriman takes a breath and straightens his jacket a bit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRIMAN
{DIALOGUE}: Well, then... I guess it's up to us.
{META_DATA}: (to Demora)
{DIALOGUE}: Helm, lay in an intercept course and engage at maximum warp.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk fidgets in his chair, itching to get in on the action - his instincts taking over.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Scotty shoots him a side-long glance.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTTY
{DIALOGUE}: Is there something wrong with your chair, Captain?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk gives him a look.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 13 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The ship snaps into warp.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 14 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE

{DIALOGUE}: We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRIMAN
{DIALOGUE}: On screen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 15 INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Which now shows a HUGE RIBBON OF CRACKLING ENERGY directly ahead of the Enterprise-B.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everyone reacts to the bizarre sight.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHEKOV
{DIALOGUE}: What the hell is that?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEMORA
{META_DATA}: (off console)
{DIALOGUE}: I've found the transport ships.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 15A INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Viewscreen now shows TWO TRANSPORT SHIPS trapped like insects in the violent torrent of energy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The ships are being buffeted and thrown about by large TENDRILS of CRACKLING ENERGY.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEMORA
{META_DATA}: (cont'd)
{DIALOGUE}: Their hulls are starting to buckle under the stress -- they won't survive much longer.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The ship suddenly SHAKES.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Navigator works his console.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NAVIGATOR
{DIALOGUE}: We're encountering severe gravimetric distortions from the energy ribbon.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRIMAN
{DIALOGUE}: We'll have to keep our distance... we don't want to get pulled in too...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Harriman frowns at the screen, trying to figure out what to do.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk can barely contain himself -- to him the answer is obvious.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He blurts out the answer --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: Tractor beam...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Scotty quickly elbows him in the side -- this isn't Kirk's ship.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk shuts up.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Harriman glances at Kirk.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRIMAN
{DIALOGUE}: We don't have a tractor beam.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRIMAN
{DIALOGUE}: It won't be installed until Tuesday.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Ensign Sulu... try generating a subspace field around the ships.
{DIALOGUE}: That might break them free.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEMORA
{DIALOGUE}: Aye, sir.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When Kirk hears this order, he shakes his head slightly and mouths the word "no" under his breath.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He knows that won't work.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEMORA
{META_DATA}: (continuing; shakes her head)
{DIALOGUE}: There's too much quantum interference, Captain.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Harriman frowns again, trying to come up with another solution, but it isn't easy -- it's his first day in command; his ship is under-manned and ill-prepared.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's a nightmare come true.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk is itching to get in On this, his fingers digging into the arms of his chair -- but he restrains himself.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRIMAN
{DIALOGUE}: What about... venting plasma from the warp nacelles?
{DIALOGUE}: That might disrupt the ribbon's hold on the ships.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NAVIGATOR
{DIALOGUE}: Aye, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: releasing drive plasma...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A tense beat.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Harriman glances over at the journalists, then glances over at Kirk.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk gives him a pained smile, trying to be encouraging even though he knows this is not the right course of action.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NAVIGATOR
{META_DATA}: (continuing)
{DIALOGUE}: It's not having any effect, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: I think --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEMORA
{DIALOGUE}: Sir!
{DIALOGUE}: The starboard vessel's hull is collapsing --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 15B INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly the right-hand ship on the screen is engulfed by a fiery TENDRIL of energy and it EXPLODES.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The other ship continues to be thrown about and buffeted.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Everyone reacts with shock on the Bridge.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHEKOV
{DIALOGUE}: How many people were aboard that ship?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEMORA
{DIALOGUE}: Two hundred sixty-five.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Harriman pales at the sight... seems shell-shocked by the destruction of the ship.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He's overwhelmed now, at a genuine loss as to what to do next.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEMORA
{META_DATA}: (urgent)
{DIALOGUE}: The Lakul's hull integrity is down to twelve percent, sir.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Harriman looks over at Kirk, who has remained quiet during this entire sequence only through great effort and out of deference to the young Captain.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This is a delicate moment -- Harriman doesn't want to look incapable, but at the same time, he needs help.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRIMAN
{DIALOGUE}: Captain Kirk... I would appreciate any... suggestions you might have.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk is out of his chair like a cork out of a bottle.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He moves down to stand next to Harriman.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{META_DATA}: (sotto)
{DIALOGUE}: First -- move us within transporter range and beam those people to the Enterprise.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Harriman looks at him with surprise.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRIMAN
{DIALOGUE}: What about the gravimetric distortions?
{DIALOGUE}: They'll tear us apart...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{META_DATA}: (gently)
{DIALOGUE}: Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk gives him a supportive look.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Harriman buckles down and grimly looks at the image on the screen.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRIMAN
{DIALOGUE}: Helm, close to within transporter range.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk glances at the Cameraman, who's still shining the light on them all.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: And second -- turn that damned thing off.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The cameraman turns OFF the light.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 16 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The ship edges in yet closer to the crackling ribbon.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The tendrils from the ribbon lash out at the ship, just missing it.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHEKOV
{META_DATA}: (concerned)

{DIALOGUE}: The medical staff... doesn't arrive until Tuesday.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chekov turns to the two journalists.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: CHEKOV
{DIALOGUE}: You and you.
{DIALOGUE}: You've just become nurses.
{DIALOGUE}: Let's go.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Chekov and the journalists EXIT to the turbolift.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: LIEUTENANT
{DIALOGUE}: Sir, I'm having trouble locking onto them.
{DIALOGUE}: They appear to be... in some sort of... temporal flux.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk turns to Scotty.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: Scotty?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Scotty quickly moves to look at the Transporter console.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTTY
{DIALOGUE}: What the hell...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk moves to him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SCOTTY
{DIALOGUE}: Their life signs are... are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: Phasing?
{DIALOGUE}: To where?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Scotty begins to work.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: NAVIGATOR
{DIALOGUE}: Sir!
{DIALOGUE}: Their hull's collapsing!

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Scotty quickly takes over the dead man's console.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: Report!
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DEMORA
{DIALOGUE}: We're caught in a gravimetric field emanating from the trailing edge of the ribbon.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: HARRIMAN
{DIALOGUE}: All engines, full reverse!
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 20 EXT. SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B &amp; RIBBON (VFX-I)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The ship is turning sideways into the WAKE of the ribbon, but cannot break away.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Many sit on the floor, staring into middle distance.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: some lie on tables, unconscious.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: others are mumbling incoherently to themselves.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: Wait a minute.
{DIALOGUE}: I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: That is true.
{DIALOGUE}: However, I believe my growth as an artificial life form has reached an impasse.
{DIALOGUE}: For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human" - to grow beyond my original programming.
{DIALOGUE}: And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor.
{META_DATA}: (re: chip)
{DIALOGUE}: This emotion chip is the only answer.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi considers a moment, looks at the chip... and reluctantly has to agree.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: All right...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data sits down and La Forge moves to stand behind him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it.
{DIALOGUE}: agreed?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Agreed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi works on Data's head for a moment, and then OPENS a panel on Data's head, revealing the blinking circuitry within.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 55 INT. READY ROOM
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riker is standing next to Picard, who has his back turned and is staring out the window.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: We found two dead Romulans aboard the station.
{DIALOGUE}: We're analyzing their equipment to see if we can determine what ship they came from.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard nods absently.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: We think they were looking for something -- they practically tore the place apart.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Hmm...
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Inform Starfleet Command.
{DIALOGUE}: This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: You want me to contact Starfleet?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Is there a problem?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: No, sir.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Thank you, Number One.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard keeps his back turned, looking out the window.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riker hesitates, awkward.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: There is something else, Captain.
{DIALOGUE}: One of the scientists.
{DIALOGUE}: a Doctor Soran... has insisted on speaking with you.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Understood.
{DIALOGUE}: That will be all.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: Sir... is there anything wrong?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: Thank you.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They move to the bar.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Guinan comes over -- she has not aged at all since the Enterprise-B.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She sets down an exotic-looking container full of dark liquid.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{DIALOGUE}: You two just volunteered to be my first victims.
{META_DATA}: (re: liquid)
{DIALOGUE}: This is a new concoction I picked up on Forcas Three.
{DIALOGUE}: Trust me, you're going to love it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She pours two glasses of the liquid.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data takes one and sniffs it, then takes a drink.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi watches him closely.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data frowns.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: Well...?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: Really?
{DIALOGUE}: What do you feel?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: I am uncertain.
{DIALOGUE}: I have had little experience with emotions... I am unable to articulate the sensation.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{DIALOGUE}: Emotions?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: I'll explain later...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data finishes the drink... concentrates, tries to make sense of the rush of feelings.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His expression is one of disgust.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{META_DATA}: (to Geordi)
{DIALOGUE}: I don't think he likes it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{META_DATA}: (excited)
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{DIALOGUE}: That is it.
{DIALOGUE}: I hate it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: Data, I think the chip is working...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data looks at Geordi with a big smile on his face.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{DIALOGUE}: I hate this!
{DIALOGUE}: It is revolting!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beat.

{DIALOGUE}: Another round?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Please.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: In the b.g., we see Picard ENTER Ten Forward.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 57 FOLLOW PICARD
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: as he walks through Ten Forward and heads toward a table by the windows.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Soran is sitting at the table, staring out at the stars, lost in thought.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His observatory uniform is distinctive, and sets him apart from everyone else in the room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard walks up to the table.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Doctor Soran...?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, yes, Captain -- thank you for coming.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The men shake hands and Picard sits down.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Soran is an imposing physical presence, but at the moment he seems very much the eccentric scientists consumed with his work.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard waves away a waiter.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Nothing for me.
{META_DATA}: (brusque, to Soran)
{DIALOGUE}: I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{DIALOGUE}: Yes.
{DIALOGUE}: I need to return to the observatory immediately.
{DIALOGUE}: I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard's reaction is a little impatient -- this doesn't sound that imperative to him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Doctor... we're still conducting an investigation into the attack.
{DIALOGUE}: Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory.
{DIALOGUE}: Until then --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{DIALOGUE}: The timing is very important on my experiment -- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: We're doing the best we can.
{DIALOGUE}: Now if you'll excuse me...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard moves to stand, but Soran reaches out and gently but firmly grabs him by the arm.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The unexpected physical contact and the change of intensity in Soran's face stops Picard in his tracks.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{META_DATA}: (cryptically)
{DIALOGUE}: They say time is the fire in which we burn... and right now, Captain, my time is running out.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: We leave so many things unfinished in our lives -- I'm sure you can understand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For some reason, Soran's words have struck a deep chord within Picard.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks away from Soran's compelling gaze and thinks for a long moment.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: When he finally speaks, his voice is barely above a whisper.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: I'll see what I can do...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard walks away without a word before Soran can thank him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Soran looks after him with relief, then pulls out an ANTIQUE POCKET WATCH and opens it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks at the watch for a long moment.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: then snaps it closed and head for the opposite exit from the one Picard took.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: FOLLOW Soran across Ten Forward...until he suddenly stops in shock at something he sees...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 58 SORAN'S POV
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: of Guinan, who is now back at the bar.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 59 RESUME SORAN
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A dark look crosses his face -- he is disturbed by the sight of Guinan.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He quickly turns and EXITS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 60 ON GUINAN
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: she begins to sense something, as though someone is watching her.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She turns, looks in the direction where Soran was just standing, but there's no one there now.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Worf activates a MONITOR which shows a complex diagram of sensor information.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder.
{DIALOGUE}: We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: Trilithium?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on.
{DIALOGUE}: In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon.
{DIALOGUE}: But they never found a way to stabilize it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory?
{DIALOGUE}: It doesn't make any sense.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riker considers.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{META_DATA}: (cont'd)
{DIALOGUE}: Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team... tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: Aye, sir.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 62 INT. OBSERVATORY OPS

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data giggles louder.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{META_DATA}: (laughing, to himself)
{DIALOGUE}: I get it.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi looks blankly at him for a moment.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: What?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: During the Farpoint mission.
{DIALOGUE}: We were on the Bridge and you told a joke.
{DIALOGUE}: That was the punch line.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: The Farpoint mission?
{DIALOGUE}: Data, that was seven years ago.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: I know.
{DIALOGUE}: I just got it.
{META_DATA}: (laughs)
{DIALOGUE}: It was very funny.

{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 63 INT. OBSERVATORY CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A short corridor connecting the Ops Center with other compartments.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi suddenly stops in front of what appears to be a standard bulkhead.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: Wait a minute... there's a hidden doorway here.
{DIALOGUE}: I can see the joint of the metal with my VISOR.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi runs his finger in a vertical line along what appears to be a smooth bulkhead.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{META_DATA}: (off tricorder)
{DIALOGUE}: There appears to be a dampening field in operation.
{DIALOGUE}: I cannot scan beyond the bulkhead.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi puts his tricorder away and begins looking for a way to open the door.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: I don't see a control panel...or an access port.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{META_DATA}: (off tricorder)
{DIALOGUE}: It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data steps forward and OPENS a small panel on wrist and makes a quick adjustment to the circuitry within.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: I believe I can reverse the polarity by attenuating my axial servo.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data completes his adjustment and then moves his wrist over the door panel.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{META_DATA}: (joking)
{DIALOGUE}: "Open sesame."
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is a HUMMING sound followed by a loud CLICK.

{DIALOGUE}: Someone went to a lot of trouble to shield this room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They put their tricorders away and begin looking around the room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data continues to snicker and giggle as he tries not to laugh at jokes his mind conjures up.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi begins inspecting the probes... finally stops at one probe which has SEVERAL ODD DEVICES attached to the side.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: Data, take a look at this.
{META_DATA}: (Data comes over)
{DIALOGUE}: You ever seen a solar probe with this kind of configuration?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data uses the tricorder as if it were a puppet as he opens and closes it like a mouth.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{META_DATA}: (making tricorder "talk")
{DIALOGUE}: No, Geordi.
{DIALOGUE}: I have not.
{DIALOGUE}: It is most unusual.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data giggles and Geordi reacts with the irritation of someone listening to a very bad comedian.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: Just help me get this panel open.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data helps Geordi as they try to open a panel on the casing of the probe.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They open the panel and Geordi looks inside.he reacts to something.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then it stops and he FALLS to the ground.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: Data!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi rushes to him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data has a look of surprise on his face as he blinks a few times.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He sits up.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: Data, are you all right?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA

{META_DATA}: (hits combadge)
{DIALOGUE}: La Forge to Enterprise.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There's no response.

{DIALOGUE}: Is there a problem, gentlemen?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 65 INCLUDE SORAN
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: standing in the room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi didn't hear him come in.

{DIALOGUE}: Will you give me a hand?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Over the above dialogue, Soran glances over at the solar probe Geordi was inspecting.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He notes the opened panel and a disturbed look crosses his face.

{DIALOGUE}: I believe I Am... afraid.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly Soran's communicator BEEPS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Soran reaches down and grabs the unconscious Geordi by the collar and the two of them DEMATERIALIZE.
{META_DATA}: (Soran has the VISOR in his hand.)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riker, Data and Worf react.

{DIALOGUE}: Helm, warp one, engage.
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 77 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE &amp; OBSERVATORY (VFX-I)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The Enterprise warps away just as the shock wave reaches the observatory and vaporizes it in a fiery EXPLOSION.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 78 INT. KLINGON BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On a monitor where we can see a graphic depiction of the darkening star and shock wave.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MOVE TO REVEAL
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We are the inside an old Klingon ship - it's beaten up and patched in several places, obviously not a first-line model.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Watching the Viewscreen are LURSA and B'ETOR, two powerful-looking Klingon women... They are sisters.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: aggressive... seductive... and very dangerous.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Several N.D. male Klingons man the various stations.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The sisters stare at the image of the destroyed sun in awe.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B'ETOR
{DIALOGUE}: Toh-pak-cha...
{META_DATA}: (Glorious...)
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LURSA
{DIALOGUE}: HoS qorDu...
{META_DATA}: (A great power...)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Soran now ENTERS the Bridge.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His expression is dark and angry.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is clearly not a prisoner here and he strides up to the sisters.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B'ETOR
{META_DATA}: (excited, to Soran)
{DIALOGUE}: You've done it, Soran.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But without warning, Soran HITS B'Etor squarely in the jaw, knocking her back over a console.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Several Klingons leap to their feet, drawing their weapons... but B'Etor holds up a hand as she gets to one knee.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B'ETOR
{DIALOGUE}: Wait!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She dabs a trickle of blood at the corner of her mouth... her expression is angry and threatening.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B'ETOR
{DIALOGUE}: I hope for your sake that you are initiating a mating ritual.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{DIALOGUE}: You got careless.
{DIALOGUE}: The Romulans came looking for their missing trilithium.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B'ETOR
{DIALOGUE}: Impossible.
{DIALOGUE}: We left no survivors on their outpost.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: B'Etor has now gotten to her feet in the b.g.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{DIALOGUE}: They knew it was aboard the observatory.
{DIALOGUE}: If the Enterprise hadn't intervened, they would have found it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LURSA
{DIALOGUE}: But they didn't find it... and now we have a weapon of unlimited power.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{DIALOGUE}: I have the weapon, Lursa.
{DIALOGUE}: And if you ever want me to give it to you, I advise you to be a little more careful in the future.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: B'Etor grabs Soran and holds a wicked-looking knife to his throat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: B'ETOR
{DIALOGUE}: Perhaps we are tired of waiting.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Soran is unfazed by this threat.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{DIALOGUE}: Without my research... the trilithium is worthless... as are your plans to reconquer the Klingon Empire.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Lursa reaches out and calmly pushes her sister's knife away.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{DIALOGUE}: Set course for the Veridian system.
{DIALOGUE}: Maximum warp.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: LURSA
{META_DATA}: (to Helm)
{DIALOGUE}: Bosh-ta-JaH Veridian

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A KLINGON GUARD ENTERS dragging the unconscious Geordi.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KLINGON GUARD
{DIALOGUE}: What shall I do with this?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Soran moves toward Geordi, a grim look on his face.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{DIALOGUE}: Bring him with me.
{DIALOGUE}: I need some answers from Mr. La Forge.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Soran EXITS.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 79 OMITTED
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 80 INT. CORRIDOR
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riker and Worf are on the move down the corridor.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{META_DATA}: (surprised)
{DIALOGUE}: Lursa and B'Etor...?
{DIALOGUE}: This doesn't make any sense.
{DIALOGUE}: A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi... and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades... Why?
{DIALOGUE}: What the hell's going on?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They EXIT to...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 81 INT. SICKBAY
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Worf and Riker ENTER.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beverly is closing a panel on the back of Data's head.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is sitting on a bio-bed, scanning himself with a tricorder.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: How is he?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{DIALOGUE}: It looks like a power surge fused the emotional chip into his neural net.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: Will that be a danger to him?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{DIALOGUE}: I don't think so.
{DIALOGUE}: The chip still seems to be working.
{DIALOGUE}: I'd feel better if I could take a closer look, but I can't remove it without completely dismantling his cerebral conduit.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{META_DATA}: (to Data)
{DIALOGUE}: Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while.
{DIALOGUE}: How do you feel?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: I am quite... preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{DIALOGUE}: We all are, Data.
{DIALOGUE}: But we're going to get him back.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: I hope so, sir.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data's expression is still one of concern.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beverly pulls Riker aside.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{DIALOGUE}: Wil, I checked into Doctor Soran's background.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Beverly activates the wall monitor and a picture of Doctor Soran along with some biographical information appears.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{DIALOGUE}: He's an El-Aurian... over three hundred years old.
{DIALOGUE}: He lost his entire family when the Borg destroyed his world.
{DIALOGUE}: Soran escaped with a handful of other refugees aboard a ship called the Lakul.
{DIALOGUE}: The ship was destroyed by some kind of energy ribbon, but Soran and forty-six others were rescued by the Enterprise-B.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: RIKER
{META_DATA}: (reacts)
{DIALOGUE}: That was the mission where James Kirk was killed.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: BEVERLY
{DIALOGUE}: I checked the passenger manifest of the Lakul... guess who else was on board?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She hits a control and suddenly Guinan's face appears on the screen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Riker reacts to the image...
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 82 INT. GUINAN'S QUARTERS
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Close on Guinan as she looks up, surprised.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{DIALOGUE}: Soran?
{DIALOGUE}: That's a name I haven't heard in a long time.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: MOVE TO REVEAL Guinan's Quarters, which are unlike any of the others on the Enterprise.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: None of the standard furniture, consoles or decoration are present.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The floor is made of tile, not carpet... the walls are draped in exotic fabric.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The lighting is moody and subdued.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard is standing before Guinan, who is sitting cross- legged on the floor.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They talk to each other with an easy familiarity... two old friends who know each other well.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Do you remember him?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{DIALOGUE}: Oh yes.
{DIALOGUE}: I remember everyone who was on the Lakul... every face.
{DIALOGUE}: even the ones who didn't make it...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Guinan stands and begins to move about the room... she's clearly troubled by the memories.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She hesitates, looks off into the middle-distance for a few moments.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard moves to her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Guinan.
{DIALOGUE}: It's important that you tell me what you know.
{DIALOGUE}: We think Soran's developed a weapon... a terrible weapon.
{DIALOGUE}: It might give him enough power to --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{DIALOGUE}: Soran doesn't care about power or weapons.
{DIALOGUE}: All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: What's the "Nexus"?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Guinan moves to a table and begins to shift around some exotic-looking alien artifacts... distracting herself... this is difficult for her to discuss.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{DIALOGUE}: It's a place I've tried very hard to forget...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She makes the decision to plunge ahead.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{DIALOGUE}: That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon traveling through space... it's a doorway.
{DIALOGUE}: It leads to another place... the Nexus.
{DIALOGUE}: It doesn't exist in our Universe... and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: What happened to you?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{DIALOGUE}: I can't remember very much... what it looked like or how long I was there... but I do remember how it felt...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: She turns to him and her face is filled with some kind of awe at the memory.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{DIALOGUE}: It was like being inside... joy.
{DIALOGUE}: As if joy was a real thing that I could wrap around myself.
{DIALOGUE}: I've never been so content...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A long beat as Picard absorbs her words.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: But then you were beamed away...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Guinan shows a rare burst of anger.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{DIALOGUE}: I was pulled away.
{DIALOGUE}: I didn't want to leave; none of us did.
{DIALOGUE}: I felt like I'd left a part of myself behind.
{DIALOGUE}: All I could think about was getting back... I didn't care what I had to do.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Guinan moves to a window and looks out at the stars.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{DIALOGUE}: It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it.
{DIALOGUE}: And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me...
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: I knew things about people... about events...about time...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Your "sixth sense"... I've always wondered where it came from...
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: And what about Soran?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{DIALOGUE}: Soran may still be obsessed with getting back.
{DIALOGUE}: And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: But why destroy a star...?
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Thank you, Guinan.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He heads for the door.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{DIALOGUE}: Let someone else do it, Jean-Luc.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard stops, looks at her.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GUINAN
{DIALOGUE}: Let them send another starship.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't get near the ribbon.
{DIALOGUE}: If you go into that Nexus, you're not going to care about Soran or the Enterprise or me.
{DIALOGUE}: All you're going to care about is how it feels to be there.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: And you're never going to come back.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard weighs her words... sees the warning in her eyes... and carefully backs away and EXITS.
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 83 INT. KLINGON BIRD OF PREY - QUARTERS (VFX-P)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A dimly-lit room somewhere in the bowels of the Klingon ship.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Like every other room on this decrepit ship, the room looks well-worn and ill-maintained.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Soran is seated behind a table, holding the VISOR.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A PADD and Soran's pocket watch sit on the table.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi is sitting in a chair across from him -- his shirt has been removed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He looks very tense.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{META_DATA}: (re: VISOR)
{DIALOGUE}: A remarkable piece of equipment... but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more... normal?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: What's normal?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{DIALOGUE}: Normal is what everyone else is... and what you are not.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: What do you want?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Soran takes a moment.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{DIALOGUE}: As you may or may not be aware, I am an El-Aurian.
{DIALOGUE}: Some people call us a race of "listeners".
{DIALOGUE}: We listen.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Right now, Mr. La Forge, you have my undivided attention.
{DIALOGUE}: I want to listen to everything you know about trilithium.
{DIALOGUE}: and me.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi thinks.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: Trilithium is an experimental compound developed by the Romulans.
{DIALOGUE}: I think it's a derivative of --
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Soran picks up the PADD from the desk and activates it.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly something small, with sharp edges, can be seen MOVING just underneath Geordi's skin near his chest.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi moves his hand to the spot, but then the protrusion is suddenly gone.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{DIALOGUE}: I don't want a science lecture.
{DIALOGUE}: You were on that observatory looking for trilithium... why?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: I was ordered to by the Captain.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On the PADD in Soran's hand, we can now see an interior graphic of Geordi's body sitting in the chair.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The graphic is interactive, moving as Geordi moves.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A BLINKING DOT represents the movement of the probe inside his body.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Right now, the dot is in the middle of his chest.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{DIALOGUE}: Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we?
{DIALOGUE}: You have information, and I need it.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Did the Captain explain his orders to you?
{DIALOGUE}: Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{DIALOGUE}: What about... Guinan?
{DIALOGUE}: What has she told you about me?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: Guinan?
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know what you're talking about...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On the PADD, we now see the dot has moved to a position next to Geordi's heart.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Soran looks up at Geordi.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{DIALOGUE}: My instincts tell me you're lying.
{DIALOGUE}: And I know that can't be easy for you...
{META_DATA}: (off PADD)
{DIALOGUE}: I can see you have a good heart.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Soran taps a control on the PADD.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Suddenly Geordi grabs his chest in pain.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Soran watches Geordi for a few seconds, then taps the PADD again.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi gasps and starts to breathe.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{DIALOGUE}: Oh... I forgot to tell you.
{DIALOGUE}: While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream.
{DIALOGUE}: It's been navigating your cardiovascular system... and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.
{META_DATA}: (smiles)
{DIALOGUE}: A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{META_DATA}: (gasping)
{DIALOGUE}: Yeah... they're full of great ideas.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{DIALOGUE}: I just stopped your heart for five seconds.
{DIALOGUE}: It felt like an eternity, didn't it?
{DIALOGUE}: Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: No... I didn't know that...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{DIALOGUE}: We learn something new about ourselves every day.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Now.
{DIALOGUE}: Maybe I didn't make myself clear.
{DIALOGUE}: It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: GEORDI
{DIALOGUE}: I told you everything... you might as well just kill me right now...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Soran's features soften as he smiles slightly.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: For a moment, he looks genuinely compassionate -- and it's a disturbing contrast to his usual dark intensity.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{DIALOGUE}: I'm not a killer, Mr. La Forge.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Let's try thirty seconds.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Soran taps a control on the PADD.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Geordi gasps and strains against an unimaginable pain.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Soran picks up his pocket watch and opens the cover... sits back in his chair, watching the seconds tick away...
{META_DATA}: CUT TO:
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 84 INT. STELLAR CARTOGRAPHY (VFX-P)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A room filled with exotic-looking devices, sensors and computers which handle the enormous task of tracking the ship's position in space.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The monitors around the room display various diagrams of the ENERGY RIBBON (as seen in the beginning of the film).
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data is sitting at a computer console which has a great deal of complex information on the screen.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard is standing next to him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Throughout the following, Data seems distracted and preoccupied.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every thirty-nine point one years
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: When is it expected back?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data doesn't answer right away.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Data?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Sorry, Captain.
{DIALOGUE}: The Ribbon has already entered the galaxy.
{DIALOGUE}: It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard moves about the room... he's frustrated... tired... but determined to find out what's going on.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon... if that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector.
{DIALOGUE}: However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Give me a list of those effects.
{DIALOGUE}: I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed... no matter how insignificant...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data works the computer and then the computer begins to work.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data sighs -- his expression becomes downcast and gloomy.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He sits down and puts his head in his hands.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard finally has to say something.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Data, are you all right?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: No, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: I am finding it difficult to concentrate... I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of... remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.

{DIALOGUE}: What do you mean?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: I wanted to save Geordi... I tried.
{DIALOGUE}: but I experienced something I did not expect.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: I believe it was fear.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard regards him sympathetically.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome.
{DIALOGUE}: It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: But I did not deal with it, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: I let it prevent me from helping my friend.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Does that make me a coward?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{DIALOGUE}: And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience... guilt.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{META_DATA}: (considers)
{DIALOGUE}: Guilt.
{DIALOGUE}: It is a most unpleasant feeling.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 84A ANGLE (VFX-P)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The computer finishes its calculations and the console BEEPS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data works the console.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Information appears on screen.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by five percent... the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction... a research project on Gorik Four was halted due to increased neutrino particles... ambient magnetic fields have decreased by --
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Wait.
{DIALOGUE}: The Bozeman... why did it change course?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{META_DATA}: (matter of fact)
{DIALOGUE}: The destruction of the Amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector.
{DIALOGUE}: Any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard is starting to get an idea... he's onto something here.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He moves to a large table in the center of the room.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (musing)
{DIALOGUE}: A minor course correction...
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Where is the ribbon now?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 84B ANGLE (VFX-P)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data moves to the table to work.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: after a few beats, an elaborate map of the galaxy springs up on the ceiling of the room.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A BLINKING DOT shows the position of the ribbon.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: This is its current position.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Can you project its course?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data hesitates... still obsessed with his own emotional turmoil.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard finally has to lay down the law.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (firm)
{DIALOGUE}: Data.
{DIALOGUE}: I have nothing but sympathy for what you're going through.
{DIALOGUE}: But right now, I need your full attention on the task at hand.
{DIALOGUE}: If you can't provide it... then I'll have to relieve you of duty until Doctor Crusher can remove this.
{DIALOGUE}: emotion chip of yours.
{DIALOGUE}: I'm sorry, but you leave me no other choice.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This snaps Data back... he considers this for a long moment, then looks determined.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: I do not wish to remove the chip, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: Although these emotions are proving difficult to deal with... I cannot imagine going back to a life without them.
{DIALOGUE}: I have taken an important step toward becoming truly human.
{DIALOGUE}: If I were to turn back now...
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: I would like to continue in my duties, sir.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard smiles at him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Courage is an emotion too, Data.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Now... can you project the course of the ribbon?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: I believe so.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 84C ANGLE (VFX-P)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data works the console.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A RED LINE moves to form an arc through the star field.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard examines the display for a moment and nods... he's excited, on to something...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Enhance grid A-nine.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data works and the display now ZOOMS into a single SECTOR.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The RED LINE cuts through the sector.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Where was the Amargosa star?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data works.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A STAR is highlighted near the red line.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Now... you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered... could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{META_DATA}: (thinks)
{DIALOGUE}: I believe so.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 84D ANGLE (VFX-P)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data works and holographic display CHANGES again.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The red line representing the course of the ribbon now shifts to the right -- AWAY from the Amargosa star's position.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard is beginning to realize what's going on.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: That's what Soran's doing... he's changing its course.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: But why?
{DIALOGUE}: Why try to alter its path... why not simply fly into it with a ship?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data thinks for a moment.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Our records show that every ship which has approached the ribbon has either been destroyed or severely damaged.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard thinks about this... then has a flash of insight.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: He can't go to the ribbon... so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.
{META_DATA}: (beat)
{DIALOGUE}: Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{META_DATA}: (works)
{DIALOGUE}: Yes, sir.
{DIALOGUE}: There are two in the Veridian system.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 84E ANGLE (VFX-P)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The display ZOOMS IN on a star very close to the ribbon's path.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We now see a SOLAR SYSTEM with a single star and FOUR PLANETS.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The RED LINE moves directly through the system -- it passes very close to the third planet.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard eyes that planet and points to it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: It's very close to Veridian Three... but not close enough...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard's mind is going a mile a minute.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He suddenly has a horrible realization.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Data, what would happen to the ribbon's path if he destroyed the Veridian star itself?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: 84F ANGLE (VFX-P)
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Data works.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: On the display, the Veridian star suddenly DARKENS and GOES OUT.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The RED LINE shifts slightly until it makes an exact INTERSECTION WITH THE THIRD PLANET.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: They both react to this sight.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: they're both aware of just how serious this is.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: That's where he's going.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (grim)
{DIALOGUE}: And destroy every planet in the system.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard eyes the graphic with a sense of dread.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Are any of them inhabited?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DATA
{DIALOGUE}: Veridian Three is uninhabited.
{DIALOGUE}: but Veridian Four supports a pre- industrial humanoid society.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: WORF
{DIALOGUE}: Sir, according to my calculations, a solar probe launched from either the Klingon ship or the planet's surface will take eleven seconds to reach the star.

{DIALOGUE}: You must think I'm quite the madman.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: The thought had crossed my mind...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: SORAN
{DIALOGUE}: The only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all.
{DIALOGUE}: So you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: and then, in one of the most difficult moments of his life, he bends down to the child...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Go on... go on without me...

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: His expression is wondrous, almost child-like.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Like in Picard's Christmas sequence, Kirk is immersed in the sensual feeling of the Nexus.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's like a dream that's over-powered him.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: Beautiful day, isn't it?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Yes... yes, it is.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk points to a nearby log on the woodpile.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk rushes into the house, and Picard follows...
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: 163 INT. KIRK'S HOME- KITCHEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk rushes in.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The kitchen's decor is 19th century with a few 23rd Century touches -- copper pans and an antique stove mixed comfortably with computer consoles and Starfleet paraphernalia.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard hesitates in the doorway -- a little unsure about rushing into some stranger's house.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk yanks a burning frying pan of food off the stove.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It's very hot -- he quickly sets it down near the sink, waves the smoke away with his hand.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: Looks like someone was cooking eggs...
{META_DATA}: (to Picard)
{DIALOGUE}: Come on in, it's all right.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard comes in and tries to orient Kirk to what's going on.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Before Kirk can react to this remark, an antique CLOCK on a shelf CHIMES as it strikes the hour.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk moves to the shelf and looks at the clock in surprise and wonder -- he is entranced by this experience, beginning to connect with things and memories from his past.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: This clock... I gave this clock to Bones...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{META_DATA}: (pressing on)
{DIALOGUE}: I'm from what you would consider the future... the twenty-fourth century.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{META_DATA}: (affectionately)

{CHARACTER_NAME}: ANTONIA'S VOICE

{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: The future... what are you talking about?
{DIALOGUE}: This is the past...

{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: This is nine years ago... the day I told her I was going back to Starfleet...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk is swept up in the moment, overwhelmed by memories, sensations, feelings.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He goes back to the frying pan and looks at the contents with a sudden burst of recognition.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: These were Ktarian eggs -- her favorite.I was cooking them to soften the blow...
{META_DATA}: (re: horseshoe)
{DIALOGUE}: And I gave her this.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard steps in.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: I know how real this must seem to you, but it's not.
{DIALOGUE}: This isn't Really your house.
{DIALOGUE}: We've both been caught up in some sort of temporal nexus.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But Kirk's mind is clearly elsewhere... he's being swept away by the emotion of the moment... realizing the opportunity he suddenly has.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: Dill weed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk indicates a shelf, as if asking Picard to go to it.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: There's a bottle of dill weed on the second shelf to the left, right behind the nutmeg.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk moves to the stove and tosses out the ruined eggs.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He cracks open two new eggs on the skillet and begins preparing a breakfast.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: How long have you been here?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk takes the bottle and uses it to season the eggs.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: I don't know.
{DIALOGUE}: I was on the Enterprise-B... in the deflector control room... keep stirring these, will you?

{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: History records that you died saving the Enterprise-B from an energy ribbon eighty years ago...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But Picard's words mean almost nothing to Kirk.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He is Thoroughly enjoying himself and Picard is almost a distraction.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk begins serving the eggs onto the plates and grabs a small vase of flowers to put on the tray.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{META_DATA}: (amused)
{DIALOGUE}: So you're telling me this is the twenty-fourth century... and I'm dead?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Not exactly.
{DIALOGUE}: As I said, this is some kind of...
{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{DIALOGUE}: Temporal nexus... yeah, I heard you.
{META_DATA}: (frowns at tray)
{DIALOGUE}: Something's missing...
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Then he remembers and turns to look at a nearby toaster -- as if on cue, two slices of toast pop out.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk grins and puts the toast on the plates.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Kirk picks up the tray and heads for the door.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PICARD
{DIALOGUE}: Captain, I need your help.

{DIALOGUE}: I was like you once... so worried about duty and obligations that I couldn't see anything past this uniform.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: KIRK
{META_DATA}: (looking up the stairs)
{DIALOGUE}: I'm going to walk up these stairs, march into that bedroom and tell Antonia that I want to marry her.

{DIALOGUE}: This time things are going to be different.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He goes through a bedroom door and closes it behind him.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Picard glances around the room in frustration, then gets a determined look on his face and marches up the stairs after Kirk, grasps the doorknob, opens it and steps through the door into

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Horse and rider land together and Kirk spurs the horse on.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: But as he rides, we begin to see a change come over him -- a look of doubt crosses his face.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Something's not right.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He slows the horse to a trot... and then to a complete stop.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: He sits there for a moment and frowns.
