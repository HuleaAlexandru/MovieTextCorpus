{META_DATA}: By Guy Ritchie
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - PRESENT
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This whole scene is shot using only extreme close-ups of eyes, cards, tapping fingers and mouths.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We open on a bright pair of eyes.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: One is bruised and slightly swollen, but this does not detract from their clarity.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDDY
{DIALOGUE}: Three card brag is a simple form of poker; you are dealt only three cards and these you can't change.
{DIALOGUE}: If you don't look at your cards you're a `blind man' and you only put in half the stake.
{DIALOGUE}: Three of any kind is the highest you can get: the odds are four hundred and twenty- five to one.
{DIALOGUE}: Then it's a running flush - you know, all the same suit running in order; then a straight, then a flush, then a pair, and finally whatever the highest card you are holding.
{DIALOGUE}: There are some tell- tale signs that are valuable; I am not going to tell you them because it took me long enough to learn them, but these can only help a player, not make one.
{DIALOGUE}: So you want to play?
{META_DATA}: DISSOLVE TO BLACK. THE FIRST OF THE CREDITS APPEAR ON THE SCREEN.
{META_DATA}: FADE IN:
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: What have you got?
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We cut to a beady pair of eyes and then to his cards as they are turned over: three hearts of no consecutive numbers are exposed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: That's a good hand.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: A flush beats my pair.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: What about you?
{META_DATA}: Cut from completed film.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Another pair of excited eyes widen to the question.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We see more cards: a run is revealed.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: And here's me trying to explain the game to you.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: Hustlers, you're all hustlers!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We cut to a shot of a small amount of money being scooped up.

{CHARACTER_NAME}: SERG

{CHARACTER_NAME}: EDDY
{DIALOGUE}: If you think you're in the dark, I am in a black hole, blindfolded.
{META_DATA}: DISSOLVE TO BLACK. THE MUSIC STARTS.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: We then see one smoking barrel; 'boom!'
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: the other is let off: AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS joins the sentence.]
{SCENE_BOUNDARY}: EXT. STREET (FLASHBACK] - DAY

{DIALOGUE}: Take a bag, take a bag.
{DIALOGUE}: I took a bag, I took a bag home last night and she cost a lot more than ten pounds I can tell ya.
{DIALOGUE}: Tell me if I am going too cheap.
{DIALOGUE}: Not ninety, not eighty, not forty, half that and half that again, that's right, ten pounds.
{DIALOGUE}: Don't think 'cos it's sealed up it's an empty box.
{DIALOGUE}: The only man who sells empty boxes is the undertaker, and by the look of some of you here today I would make more money with me measuring tape.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: It seems he can't wait to get rid of it.

{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: This really stokes the fire.
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: The money can't come fast enough.

{DIALOGUE}: Smithy didn't do a very good job.
{DIALOGUE}: Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock.
{DIALOGUE}: He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.

{DIALOGUE}: Guaranteed results or money back, all that bollocks.
{DIALOGUE}: These dills cost twenty-five each; a snip for all the pleasure they are going to give the recipients.
{DIALOGUE}: They send a cheque to the company name, nothing offensive, er, Bobbie's Bits or something, for twenty-five.
{DIALOGUE}: You put these in the bank for two weeks and let them clear.
{DIALOGUE}: Now this is the clever bit.
{DIALOGUE}: Then you send back the cheques for twenty-five pounds from the real company name, Arse Tickler's Faggot Fan Club, saying sorry, we couldn't get the supply from America, they have sold out.
{DIALOGUE}: Now you see how many of the people cash those cheques; not a single soul, because who wants his bank manager to know he tickles arses when he is not paying in cheques!
{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}: There is a long pause while BACON considers this.

{DIALOGUE}: What's that idiot doing next door?
{META_DATA}: (Points at Paul)
{DIALOGUE}: We use your van.

{DIALOGUE}: There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: PLANK
{DIALOGUE}: No.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DOG
{DIALOGUE}: And it better bloody not be.
{DIALOGUE}: Once he is firmly in place, he gets the rest of us in.
{DIALOGUE}: We'll get nasty with a couple of them, shit 'em up, scare and gag 'em.
{DIALOGUE}: I can't see these wankers giving us a problem, but they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy.
{DIALOGUE}: When the job is done we'll come straight back here.
{DIALOGUE}: It's dark by then, unload and Robert's your father's brother.
{DIALOGUE}: Everybody savvy?
{CHARACTER_NAME}: ALL TOGETHER
{DIALOGUE}: Yup.
{CHARACTER_NAME}: DOG
{DIALOGUE}: Right, tomorrow, eight o'clock we'll do it.

{DIALOGUE}: As long as we are all out of our hiding places quickly, it's the last thing they'll expect.
{DIALOGUE}: If Tom and anyone else feels like kicking them around a bit I am sure it won't do any harm.
