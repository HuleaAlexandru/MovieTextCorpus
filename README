	This repository contains a corpus made of textual files from movies(subtitle and screenplay). The main steps of the process can be seen in Download, Sanitize, Annotate, Synchronize folders. 
	Having the file "moviesInfo", we first collect the files needed, the subtitles and the screenplays. These files can be seen in the Download folder. 
	We remove the programming language dependent tags and save the files in the Sanitize folder. 
	The screenplays and subtitles are then annotated. For each subtitle, each part which appears on the screen is split in sentences and assigned to each sentence two temporal boundaries. For each screenplay we assign to each sentence a class from the following: scene boundary, scene description, character name, dialogue, metadata. The output of this step can be seen in the Annotate folder.
	The synchronization process consists in giving to each sentence from the screenplay two temporal boundaries. This way we identify in time each sentence from the screenplay, information that can be used along with the audio or the video components of the movies. The final result of the process, the corpus can be seen in the Synchronize folder.
