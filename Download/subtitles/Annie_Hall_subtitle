1
00:00:57,152 --> 00:00:59,211
There's an old joke.

2
00:00:59,287 --> 00:01:02,256
Two elderly women are at
a Catskill mountain resort.

3
00:01:02,325 --> 00:01:05,590
One says, "The food at this
place is really terrible. "

4
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:08,654
The other says, "I know,
and such small portions. "

5
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:11,700
That's essentially
how I feel about life:

6
00:01:11,768 --> 00:01:15,500
full of loneliness, misery,
suffering and unhappiness...

7
00:01:15,573 --> 00:01:18,737
and it's all over
much too quickly.

8
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:21,576
The other important
joke for me...

9
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,344
is one usually attributed
to Groucho Marx...

10
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:28,286
but it appears originally in Freud's
Wit and Its Relation to the Unconscious.

11
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:30,586
It goes like this,
I'm paraphrasing:

12
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:35,028
I never want to belong to any club that
would have someone like me for a member.

13
00:01:35,097 --> 00:01:39,967
That's the key joke of my adult life
in terms of my relationships with women.

14
00:01:40,035 --> 00:01:43,233
Lately the strangest things have
been going through my mind...

15
00:01:43,306 --> 00:01:46,936
because I turned 40, and I guess
I'm going through a life crisis.

16
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:49,742
I'm not worried about aging.
I'm not one of those characters.

17
00:01:49,814 --> 00:01:53,409
But I'm balding slightly on top. That's
about the worst you can say about me.

18
00:01:53,485 --> 00:01:56,819
I think I'm going to get
better as I get older.

19
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,858
I think I'm going to be
the balding, virile type...

20
00:01:59,926 --> 00:02:03,760
as opposed to the
distinguished gray.

21
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,821
Unless I'm neither of those two.

22
00:02:05,898 --> 00:02:08,391
Unless I'm one of those guys with
saliva dribbling out of his mouth...

23
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:13,100
who wanders into a cafeteria with a
shopping bag, screaming about socialism.

24
00:02:14,076 --> 00:02:17,739
Annie and I broke up, and I still
can't get my mind around that.

25
00:02:17,813 --> 00:02:21,375
I keep sifting the pieces of the
relationship through my mind...

26
00:02:21,452 --> 00:02:26,321
examining my life and trying to
figure out where did the screw-up come.

27
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,326
A year ago we were in love.

28
00:02:30,928 --> 00:02:34,593
It's funny. I'm not a morose type.
I'm not a depressive character.

29
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:38,402
I was a reasonably happy kid.

30
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,498
I was brought up in
Brooklyn during World War ll.

31
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,005
He's been depressed.

32
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:47,514
- Suddenly he can't do anything.
- Why are you depressed, Alvy?

33
00:02:47,582 --> 00:02:51,610
Tell Dr. Flicker.
It's something he read.

34
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:53,678
Something he read, huh?

35
00:02:53,755 --> 00:02:58,023
- The universe is expanding.
- The universe is expanding?

36
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,893
The universe is everything,
and if it's expanding...

37
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:04,834
someday it will break apart, and
that will be the end of everything.

38
00:03:04,902 --> 00:03:09,306
What is that your business?
He stopped doing his homework!

39
00:03:09,374 --> 00:03:12,867
- What's the point?
- What's the universe got to do with it?

40
00:03:12,946 --> 00:03:16,313
You're here in Brooklyn.
Brooklyn is not expanding!

41
00:03:16,383 --> 00:03:20,377
It won't be expanding
for billions of years!

42
00:03:20,453 --> 00:03:25,392
We've got to try and enjoy
ourselves while we're here! Huh?

43
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:33,532
My analyst says I exaggerate
my childhood memories...

44
00:03:33,603 --> 00:03:36,072
but I swear I was brought up
underneath the roller coaster...

45
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,336
in the Coney Island
section of Brooklyn.

46
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,709
Maybe that accounts for my
personality, which is a little nervous.

47
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,515
I have a hyperactive imagination. My
mind tends to jump around a little.

48
00:03:47,587 --> 00:03:51,044
I have some trouble
between fantasy and reality.

49
00:03:51,957 --> 00:03:54,358
My father ran the
bumper-car concession.

50
00:03:54,428 --> 00:03:57,125
There he is, and there I am.

51
00:03:57,198 --> 00:04:00,656
I used to get my aggression
out through those cars.

52
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,530
I remember the staff
at our public school.

53
00:04:05,606 --> 00:04:08,941
We had a saying, "Those
who can't do, teach...

54
00:04:09,012 --> 00:04:12,277
and those who can't
teach, teach gym. "

55
00:04:12,348 --> 00:04:16,752
And those who couldn't do anything,
I think, were assigned to our school.

56
00:04:19,523 --> 00:04:22,185
I must say, I always thought
my schoolmates were idiots.

57
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,195
Melvyn Greenglass and
his fat little face.

58
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:28,427
And Henrietta Farrell,
Miss Perfect all the time.

59
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:32,096
And Ivan Ackerman, always
the wrong answer. Always!

60
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,106
Seven and three is nine.

61
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:37,410
Even then I knew
they were just jerks.

62
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:40,972
In 1942 I had already
discovered women.

63
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,511
He kissed me!

64
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:49,057
That's the second time
this month! Step up here.

65
00:04:49,124 --> 00:04:51,116
- What did I do?
- Step up here.

66
00:04:51,195 --> 00:04:53,789
- What did I do?
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

67
00:04:53,865 --> 00:04:56,801
Why? I was just expressing
a healthy sexual curiosity.

68
00:04:56,867 --> 00:05:00,327
Six-year-old boys don't
have girls on their minds.

69
00:05:00,404 --> 00:05:01,566
I did.

70
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:05,543
For God sakes, Alvy, even Freud
speaks of a latency period!

71
00:05:05,613 --> 00:05:08,775
I never had a latency
period. I can't help it.

72
00:05:08,848 --> 00:05:11,180
Why couldn't you have
been more like Donald?

73
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:13,618
There was a model boy.

74
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,053
Tell the folks where
you are today, Donald.

75
00:05:16,123 --> 00:05:19,651
I run a profitable dress company.

76
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:23,460
Sometimes I wonder where
my classmates are today.

77
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:27,401
I'm president of the
Pinkus Plumbing Company.

78
00:05:28,337 --> 00:05:30,238
I sell talliths.

79
00:05:30,307 --> 00:05:35,144
I used to be a heroin addict,
now I'm a methadone addict.

80
00:05:36,214 --> 00:05:38,512
I'm into leather.

81
00:05:39,684 --> 00:05:43,177
I lost track of most of my old
schoolmates, but I wound up a comedian.

82
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:46,282
They did not take me in the army.

83
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:49,022
I was 4-P.

84
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:52,691
In the event of
war, I'm a hostage.

85
00:05:54,268 --> 00:05:57,706
You always only saw
the worst in people.

86
00:05:57,773 --> 00:06:00,834
You never could get along
with anyone in school.

87
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,311
You were always out
of step with the world.

88
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:06,315
Even when you got famous, you
still distrusted the world.

89
00:06:06,383 --> 00:06:10,046
I distinctly heard it. He
muttered under his breath, "Jew. "

90
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,055
- You're crazy.
- No, I'm not.

91
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:15,286
We were walking off the tennis court.
He was there and me and his wife.

92
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,385
He looked her, then
they both looked at me...

93
00:06:17,462 --> 00:06:19,625
and under his breath
he said, "Jew. "

94
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,667
You're a total paranoid.

95
00:06:21,735 --> 00:06:24,636
How am I a paranoid? I pick
up on those kind of things.

96
00:06:24,705 --> 00:06:29,336
I was having lunch with guys from
NBC, so I said, "Did you eat yet?"

97
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:34,041
Tom Christie said, "No.
Jew?" Not "Did you?"

98
00:06:34,116 --> 00:06:37,381
Not "Did you eat?" but
"Jew eat?" You get it?

99
00:06:37,453 --> 00:06:40,082
- Max- - Stop
calling me Max.

100
00:06:40,156 --> 00:06:43,887
Why? It's a good name for you. Max,
you see conspiracies in everything.

101
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,485
No, I don't. I was in a
record store. Listen to this.

102
00:06:46,563 --> 00:06:52,162
There's this tall, blond crew-cutted guy
and he's looking at me in a funny way.

103
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:55,137
He's saying, "Yes, we have
a sale this week on Wagner. "

104
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:58,473
Wagner, Max. I know what
he's trying to tell me.

105
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:01,036
Very significantly, Wagner.

106
00:07:01,115 --> 00:07:04,677
Right, Max. California, Max.

107
00:07:04,752 --> 00:07:07,812
- Get the hell out of this crazy city.
- Forget it.

108
00:07:07,888 --> 00:07:10,882
We move to sunny L.A. All of
show business is out there.

109
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,793
You keep bringing it up, but I
don't want to live in a city...

110
00:07:13,863 --> 00:07:17,993
where the only cultural advantage is
you can make a right turn on a red light.

111
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:21,060
All right, forget it. Aren't you
going to be late for meeting Annie?

112
00:07:21,138 --> 00:07:23,937
I'm meeting her in front of the Beekman.
I have a few minutes left, right?

113
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,986
Are you on television?

114
00:07:47,602 --> 00:07:49,262
Yeah, occasionally.

115
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,032
What's your name?

116
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:53,040
You wouldn't know
it. It doesn't matter.

117
00:07:53,108 --> 00:07:57,137
You're on Johnny Carson, right?

118
00:07:58,182 --> 00:07:59,945
Once in a while.

119
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:02,543
What's your name?

120
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:05,987
- I'm Robert Redford.
- Come on!

121
00:08:07,058 --> 00:08:10,256
Alvy Singer. Thanks
very much for everything.

122
00:08:13,364 --> 00:08:15,391
This is Alvy Singer!

123
00:08:17,604 --> 00:08:20,699
This guy's on television.
Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?

124
00:08:20,774 --> 00:08:23,107
- Give me a break.
- This guy's on television.

125
00:08:23,177 --> 00:08:25,111
I need the large polo mallet.

126
00:08:25,179 --> 00:08:28,513
- Who's on television?
- This guy, on the Johnny Carson Show.

127
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:32,179
- Is this a meeting of the teamsters?
- What program?

128
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:34,223
- Can I have your autograph?
- You don't want my autograph.

129
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:37,226
I do! It's for my girlfriend.

130
00:08:37,294 --> 00:08:39,320
Make it out to Ralph.

131
00:08:39,396 --> 00:08:42,991
- Your girlfriend's name is Ralph?
- It's for my brother.

132
00:08:46,872 --> 00:08:48,966
You're really Alvy
Singer, the TV star?

133
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:54,036
- Alvy Singer over here!
- It's all right, fellas.

134
00:08:54,114 --> 00:08:56,810
Jesus, what did you do? Come
by way of the Panama Canal?

135
00:08:56,885 --> 00:09:00,116
- I'm in a bad mood.
- I'm here with the Godfather cast.

136
00:09:00,188 --> 00:09:04,319
- Learn to deal with it.
- I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech.

137
00:09:04,393 --> 00:09:06,987
Please, I have a headache.

138
00:09:07,062 --> 00:09:10,123
You are in a bad mood. You
must be getting your period.

139
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,192
I'm not getting my period! Jesus!

140
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,330
Every time anything out of the ordinary
happens, you think I have my period.

141
00:09:15,406 --> 00:09:18,136
A little louder. I think one
of them may have missed it.

142
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:21,407
- Has the picture started?
- Two minutes ago.

143
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,675
That's it. Forget
it. I can't go in.

144
00:09:23,749 --> 00:09:26,650
- Two minutes.
- We've blown it already.

145
00:09:26,718 --> 00:09:29,118
I can't go in, in the middle.

146
00:09:29,188 --> 00:09:32,125
In the middle? We've only missed
the titles. They're in Swedish.

147
00:09:32,194 --> 00:09:34,127
You want to get
coffee for two hours?

148
00:09:34,195 --> 00:09:37,460
- Two hours? No. I'm going
in. - Go ahead. Good-bye.

149
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:40,262
While we're talking,
we could be inside.

150
00:09:40,335 --> 00:09:44,238
Can we not argue in front of
everybody? I get embarrassed.

151
00:09:44,307 --> 00:09:48,971
- All right. So what do you want to do?
- I don't know. Go to another movie?

152
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:51,309
- Let's see The Sorrow and the Pity.
- We've seen it.

153
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,476
I'm not in the mood to see a
four hour documentary on Nazis.

154
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,577
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:56,654 --> 00:10:01,591
I've got to see a picture exactly
from start to finish, 'cause I'm anal.

156
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:03,629
That's a polite word
for what you are.

157
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:10,099
We saw the Fellini film last
Tuesday. It is not one of his best.

158
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,229
It lacks a cohesive structure.

159
00:10:12,305 --> 00:10:16,175
You get the feeling he's not absolutely
sure what it is he wants to say.

160
00:10:16,245 --> 00:10:21,183
I've always felt he was
essentially a technical filmmaker.

161
00:10:21,251 --> 00:10:24,344
Granted La Strada
was a great film.

162
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:27,549
Great in its use of negative
imagery more than anything else.

163
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,890
- I'm going to have a stroke.
- Stop listening to him.

164
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:34,296
He's screaming his
opinions in my ear.

165
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:37,803
All that Juliet of the
Spirits or Satyricon.

166
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,067
I found it incredibly indulgent.

167
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,337
He really is one of the
most indulgent of filmmakers.

168
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,708
Key word here is "indulgent. "

169
00:10:47,782 --> 00:10:52,013
- What are you depressed about?
- I missed my therapy. I overslept.

170
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:54,180
How can you possibly oversleep?

171
00:10:54,255 --> 00:10:55,951
The alarm clock.

172
00:10:56,025 --> 00:10:58,050
You know what a hostile
gesture that is to me?

173
00:10:58,128 --> 00:11:01,119
I know. Because of our
sexual problem, right?

174
00:11:01,197 --> 00:11:05,156
Everybody in line has to
know our rate of intercourse?

175
00:11:05,235 --> 00:11:07,066
It's like Samuel Beckett.

176
00:11:07,137 --> 00:11:10,973
I admire the technique, but it
doesn't hit me on a gut level.

177
00:11:11,043 --> 00:11:13,807
- I'd like to hit him on a gut level.
- Stop it.

178
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:17,873
He's spitting on my
neck when he talks.

179
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:21,114
You know something else?
You're so egocentric that...

180
00:11:21,187 --> 00:11:24,715
if I miss my therapy you can only think
of it in terms of how it affects you!

181
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,192
They're probably
on their first date.

182
00:11:29,264 --> 00:11:32,927
Probably met by answering an ad
in the New York Review of Books.

183
00:11:33,002 --> 00:11:34,935
"Thirtyish academic
wishes to meet woman...

184
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:38,941
who's interested in Mozart,
James Joyce and sodomy. "

185
00:11:39,008 --> 00:11:40,942
What do you mean
"our sexual problem"?

186
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,536
I'm comparatively normal
for a guy raised in Brooklyn.

187
00:11:43,614 --> 00:11:47,675
I'm sorry. My sexual problem.
Okay? My sexual problem!

188
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:51,917
I never read that. That was Henry
James' sequel to Turn of the Screw?

189
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:54,517
It's the influence of television.

190
00:11:54,594 --> 00:12:00,362
Marshall McLuhan deals with it in
terms of it being a high intensity.

191
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:02,526
Do you understand? A hot medium.

192
00:12:02,602 --> 00:12:06,836
What I wouldn't give for a large
sock with horse manure in it.

193
00:12:06,908 --> 00:12:10,708
What do you do when you get stuck
on a movie line with a guy like this?

194
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:13,874
Wait. Why can't I give my
opinion? It's a free country!

195
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,441
He can. Do you have
to give it so loud?

196
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,953
Aren't you ashamed to
pontificate like that?

197
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:23,324
The funny part is, you don't know
anything about Marshall McLuhan.

198
00:12:23,395 --> 00:12:27,957
I happen to teach a class at Columbia
called "TV, Media and Culture. "

199
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:31,834
I think my insights into Mr. McLuhan
have a great deal of validity.

200
00:12:31,904 --> 00:12:36,672
Do you? That's funny, because I
happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here.

201
00:12:36,743 --> 00:12:40,305
Just let me
- Come over here. Tell him.

202
00:12:40,381 --> 00:12:42,372
I heard what you were saying.

203
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:46,945
You know nothing of my work. You
mean my whole fallacy is wrong.

204
00:12:47,022 --> 00:12:50,287
How you ever got to teach a course
in anything is totally amazing!

205
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:52,987
If life were only like this.

206
00:12:56,298 --> 00:13:00,600
June 14, 1940. The German
army occupies Paris.

207
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:04,768
All over the country, people
are desperate for food.

208
00:13:04,843 --> 00:13:08,439
Those guys in the French
Resistance were really brave.

209
00:13:08,514 --> 00:13:11,312
To have to listen to Maurice
Chevalier sing so much.

210
00:13:11,384 --> 00:13:15,252
I know. Sometimes I ask myself
how I'd stand up under torture.

211
00:13:15,322 --> 00:13:17,313
You? You kidding?

212
00:13:17,391 --> 00:13:21,386
The Gestapo would take away your charge
card, and you'd tell 'em everything.

213
00:13:21,463 --> 00:13:23,489
That movie makes me feel guilty.

214
00:13:23,566 --> 00:13:25,693
It's supposed to.

215
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:29,768
- Alvy,
I- - What?

216
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,138
What's the matter?

217
00:13:33,176 --> 00:13:36,077
It's not natural. We're
sleeping in a bed together.

218
00:13:36,146 --> 00:13:38,080
It's been a long time!

219
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:40,618
It's just, I mean-

220
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,348
I've got to sing tomorrow night,
so I have to rest my voice.

221
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:46,687
It's always some kind of an excuse.
You used to think I was very sexy.

222
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:49,488
When we first started going
out, we had sex constantly.

223
00:13:49,561 --> 00:13:52,191
We're probably listed in The
Guiness Book of World Records.

224
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:56,135
It'll pass. I'm going
through a phase, that's all.

225
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:58,694
You've been married before.
You know how things can get.

226
00:13:58,773 --> 00:14:01,492
You were very hot
for Allison at first.

227
00:14:05,432 --> 00:14:09,697
You know that you're on right after
Chris Brown, in about 20 minutes.

228
00:14:09,768 --> 00:14:11,759
Excuse me. When do I go on?

229
00:14:11,837 --> 00:14:13,829
Who are you?

230
00:14:13,908 --> 00:14:16,342
Alvy Singer.

231
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,072
- I'm the comedian.
- Oh, comedian.

232
00:14:19,146 --> 00:14:21,979
Oh, you're on next.

233
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:24,178
What do you mean "next"?

234
00:14:24,253 --> 00:14:26,380
You're on right after this act.

235
00:14:26,456 --> 00:14:29,187
- It can't be, because he's a comic.
- Yes.

236
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:32,694
- You're putting on two comics in a row?
- Why not?

237
00:14:32,763 --> 00:14:36,130
No, I'm sorry. I'm not going
to go on after another comedian.

238
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,571
- It's okay.
- No. They're laughing. I'd rather not.

239
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,107
Will you relax, please?
They're going to love you.

240
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:46,235
I know. I prefer not to.
Look, they're laughing at him.

241
00:14:46,313 --> 00:14:48,576
What are you telling me? They'll
laugh at him a few minutes.

242
00:14:48,647 --> 00:14:51,708
Then I've got to get laughs,
too. How much can they laugh?

243
00:14:51,785 --> 00:14:54,548
- They're laughed out.
- Do you feel all right?

244
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,749
Jesus.

245
00:14:57,793 --> 00:15:00,762
- What's your name?
- Allison.

246
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:03,298
Yeah? Allison what?

247
00:15:03,365 --> 00:15:05,458
Portchnik.

248
00:15:05,835 --> 00:15:09,566
- Portchnik? That's nice.
- Thank you.

249
00:15:12,576 --> 00:15:16,535
So, you work for
Stevenson all the time?

250
00:15:16,614 --> 00:15:20,712
- No. I'm doing my thesis.
- On what?

251
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:23,950
Political commitment in
20th-century literature.

252
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:27,390
You're like New York Jewish,
left-wing, intellectual...

253
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,727
Central Park West, Brandeis
University, socialist summer camps...

254
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,961
and the father with the
Ben Shahn drawings...

255
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:37,164
really
strike-oriented-

256
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:39,606
Stop me before I make a
complete imbecile of myself.

257
00:15:39,676 --> 00:15:44,113
That was wonderful! I love being
reduced to a cultural stereotype.

258
00:15:44,181 --> 00:15:47,672
Right. I'm a bigot,
but for the left.

259
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:53,780
I have to go out there. Say
something encouraging, quickly.

260
00:15:53,858 --> 00:15:57,522
- I think you're cute.
- Yeah? Do you?

261
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,791
Go ahead.

262
00:16:10,644 --> 00:16:13,547
I don't know why they would
have me at this kind of rally...

263
00:16:13,616 --> 00:16:17,313
'cause I'm not essentially
a political comedian.

264
00:16:17,386 --> 00:16:22,050
I interestingly
had dated a woman...

265
00:16:22,124 --> 00:16:25,219
in the Eisenhower
administration, briefly.

266
00:16:25,295 --> 00:16:28,060
It was ironic to me...

267
00:16:29,366 --> 00:16:32,131
'cause I was trying
to do to her...

268
00:16:32,203 --> 00:16:35,331
what Eisenhower's been doing to the
country for the last eight years.

269
00:16:39,445 --> 00:16:41,572
I'm sorry. I can't
go through with this.

270
00:16:41,647 --> 00:16:45,107
I can't get it off my
mind! It's obsessing me!

271
00:16:45,187 --> 00:16:48,155
I'm getting tired of it.
I need your attention.

272
00:16:48,222 --> 00:16:52,353
But it doesn't make any sense. He
drove past the book depository...

273
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:55,659
and the police said conclusively
that it was an exit wound.

274
00:16:55,732 --> 00:17:00,101
So how is it possible for Oswald to
have fired from two angles at once?

275
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:02,228
It doesn't make sense!

276
00:17:03,507 --> 00:17:06,965
I'll tell you this. He
was not marksman enough...

277
00:17:07,044 --> 00:17:09,535
to hit a moving
target at that range.

278
00:17:09,614 --> 00:17:14,109
But if there was
a second assassin-

279
00:17:14,185 --> 00:17:16,746
- That's it!
- We've been through this.

280
00:17:16,823 --> 00:17:19,382
They recovered the
shells from that rifle.

281
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:21,484
What are you saying now?

282
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:26,022
That everybody on the Warren Commission
is in on this conspiracy, right?

283
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,762
Why not?

284
00:17:27,836 --> 00:17:31,999
- Earl Warren?
- Honey, I don't know Earl Warren.

285
00:17:32,073 --> 00:17:34,043
Lyndon Johnson?

286
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:36,475
Lyndon Johnson is a politician!

287
00:17:36,546 --> 00:17:41,143
You know the ethics those guys have.
It's a notch underneath child molester.

288
00:17:41,218 --> 00:17:43,652
Then everybody's in
on the conspiracy.

289
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:49,058
The FBl and the CIA and J. Edgar
Hoover, the oil companies...

290
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:52,461
the Pentagon, the men's-room
attendant at the White House?

291
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:55,696
I would leave out the
men's-room attendant.

292
00:17:55,768 --> 00:18:01,139
You're using this conspiracy theory
as an excuse to avoid sex with me.

293
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:04,541
Oh, my God! She's right.

294
00:18:04,612 --> 00:18:06,808
Why did I turn off
Allison Portchnik?

295
00:18:06,882 --> 00:18:10,841
She was beautiful. She was
willing. She was real intelligent.

296
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,788
Is it the old
Groucho Marx joke...

297
00:18:13,857 --> 00:18:17,816
that I don't want to belong to any
club that would have me for a member?

298
00:18:17,961 --> 00:18:21,454
- Alvy, don't panic!
- It's a mistake...

299
00:18:21,532 --> 00:18:23,466
to bring a live
thing in the house.

300
00:18:23,534 --> 00:18:25,526
Don't do that.

301
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:29,131
Maybe we should call the police.
Dial 911. It's the lobster squad.

302
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,733
They're only baby
ones. For God sakes.

303
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,939
- If they're babies, you pick them up.
- All right! All right!

304
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:37,916
- Here you go!
- Don't give it to me.

305
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:41,284
Look! One crawled
behind the refrigerator.

306
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:45,190
It'll turn up in our bed at night.
Get out of here with that thing!

307
00:18:46,863 --> 00:18:49,388
Talk to him. You speak shellfish.

308
00:18:49,465 --> 00:18:52,299
Hey, put it in the pot.

309
00:18:52,368 --> 00:18:55,897
I can't. I can't put a
live thing in hot water.

310
00:18:55,973 --> 00:18:58,238
What d'you think we were going
to do, take him to the movies?

311
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:00,401
Good. Oh, thank you.

312
00:19:00,477 --> 00:19:03,470
Okay, it's in. It's
definitely in the pot.

313
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:06,313
Annie, there's a big lobster
behind the refrigerator.

314
00:19:06,385 --> 00:19:09,321
I can't get it out.
This thing's heavy.

315
00:19:09,388 --> 00:19:13,291
Maybe if I put a dish of butter sauce
here, it'll run out the other side.

316
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,294
I'm going to get my camera.

317
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,957
I think if I could pry-

318
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:21,524
We should have gotten steaks, 'cause
they don't have legs and run around.

319
00:19:25,073 --> 00:19:28,341
- Pick this lobster up. Hold it, please.
- You're going to take pictures now?

320
00:19:28,412 --> 00:19:32,109
Alvy, it'll be
wonderful. Oh, lovely!

321
00:19:32,183 --> 00:19:35,879
- It's disgusting.
- One more, please? One more.

322
00:19:35,952 --> 00:19:37,387
Good!

323
00:19:37,456 --> 00:19:40,915
Here's what I want to know.
Am I your first, big romance?

324
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:47,523
- Who was?
- There was Dennis from high school.

325
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,402
Local kid who'd meet you in front
of the movie house on Saturday night?

326
00:19:52,473 --> 00:19:57,411
- You should've seen how I looked then.
- I can imagine. An astronaut's wife.

327
00:19:57,479 --> 00:20:00,448
- Then there was Jerry, the actor.
- Look at you.

328
00:20:00,516 --> 00:20:02,451
You're such a clown.

329
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:06,046
- I look pretty.
- You always do. But that guy with you!

330
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:10,651
Acting is like an exploration
of the soul. It's very religious.

331
00:20:10,727 --> 00:20:14,255
Like a kind of
liberating consciousness.

332
00:20:14,332 --> 00:20:16,596
It's like a visual poem.

333
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:18,726
Is he kidding with that crap?

334
00:20:18,804 --> 00:20:21,137
Oh, right!

335
00:20:21,207 --> 00:20:24,665
Right. I think I know exactly what
you mean when you say "religious. "

336
00:20:24,744 --> 00:20:27,475
- You do?
- Come on. I was younger.

337
00:20:27,548 --> 00:20:29,481
That was last year!

338
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:32,520
It's like when I think of dying.
You know how I'd like to die?

339
00:20:32,587 --> 00:20:34,020
How?

340
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,183
I'd like to get torn
apart by wild animals.

341
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:41,025
- Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
- He was a terrific actor.

342
00:20:41,096 --> 00:20:44,430
He's neat looking
and he was emotional.

343
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,732
I don't think you
like emotion too much.

344
00:20:46,804 --> 00:20:49,636
Touch my heart with your foot.

345
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,537
I may throw up.

346
00:20:51,608 --> 00:20:54,135
- He was creepy.
- Yeah!

347
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:59,549
- You're pretty lucky I came
along. - Oh, really? La-de-dah!

348
00:20:59,618 --> 00:21:03,452
If anyone ever told me that
I'd be taking out a girl...

349
00:21:03,523 --> 00:21:05,583
who used expressions
like "la-de-dah"-

350
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,891
That's right. You really
like those New York girls.

351
00:21:08,963 --> 00:21:12,364
- Not just. Not only.
- I'd say so. You married two of them.

352
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:15,026
There's Henry Drucker.

353
00:21:15,103 --> 00:21:17,230
He has a Chair in
History at Princeton.

354
00:21:17,306 --> 00:21:21,505
The short man is Hershel Kaminsky. He
has a Chair in Philosophy at Cornell.

355
00:21:21,578 --> 00:21:23,512
Two more chairs, they
got a dining room set.

356
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:27,018
- Why are you so hostile?
- I want to watch the Knicks on TV.

357
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,349
Is that Paul Goodman? No.

358
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:32,515
Be nice to the host, because
he's publishing my book.

359
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:35,720
Hi, Doug. Douglas Wyeth...

360
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,457
The Foul Rag-and-Bone
Shop of the Heart.

361
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:40,227
I'm so tired of
spending evenings...

362
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,325
making fake insights with
people who work for Dysentery.

363
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:43,835
Commentary.

364
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:47,898
I heard Commentary and Dissent
had merged and formed Dysentery.

365
00:21:47,977 --> 00:21:51,036
No jokes. These
are friends. Okay?

366
00:21:51,113 --> 00:21:54,571
Cleveland Cavaliers losing
to the New York Knicks.

367
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:58,849
Here you are. There's
people out there.

368
00:21:58,922 --> 00:22:01,720
Two minutes ago, the Knicks
are ahead 14 points...

369
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:04,282
and now they're ahead two points.

370
00:22:04,629 --> 00:22:08,224
Alvy, what is so fascinating...

371
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:13,169
about a group of pituitary cases
trying to stuff a ball through a hoop?

372
00:22:13,238 --> 00:22:15,365
What is fascinating
is that it's physical.

373
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,375
That's one thing
about intellectuals:

374
00:22:17,444 --> 00:22:21,073
They've proved you can be brilliant
and have no idea what's going on.

375
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:25,983
But, on the other hand, the
body doesn't lie as we now know.

376
00:22:27,322 --> 00:22:28,879
Stop acting out.

377
00:22:28,957 --> 00:22:32,086
It'll be great, because all those
Ph. D.s are in there discussing...

378
00:22:32,161 --> 00:22:36,030
modes of alienation, and we'll
be in here quietly humping.

379
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:40,661
Don't. You're using sex
to express hostility.

380
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:45,573
"Why do you always reduce my animal
urges to psychoanalytic categories,"...

381
00:22:45,643 --> 00:22:48,670
he said as he
removed her brassier.

382
00:22:50,481 --> 00:22:54,749
There are people out there
from the New Yorker magazine!

383
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:57,847
My God! What would they think?

384
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,569
- Damn siren!
- Don't get upset.

385
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:09,501
Damn it! I was so close!

386
00:23:09,571 --> 00:23:12,268
Last night it was a guy
honking his car horn.

387
00:23:12,342 --> 00:23:15,335
The city can't close down.

388
00:23:15,411 --> 00:23:18,939
You want them to close the
airport so we can have sex?

389
00:23:19,017 --> 00:23:21,678
I'm too tense. I need a Valium.

390
00:23:21,752 --> 00:23:24,746
My analyst says I should live in
the country and not in New York.

391
00:23:24,824 --> 00:23:28,351
We can't have this discussion all the
time. The country makes me nervous.

392
00:23:28,427 --> 00:23:32,295
You've got crickets. It's quiet.
There's no place to walk after dinner.

393
00:23:32,365 --> 00:23:35,393
There's the screens with
the dead moths behind them.

394
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,462
You got the Manson family,
possibly. You got Dick and Perry.

395
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:43,533
Okay! My analyst just thinks I'm too
tense! Where's the goddamn Valium?

396
00:23:43,612 --> 00:23:46,012
Okay, it's quiet now.
We can get started again.

397
00:23:46,082 --> 00:23:48,846
I can't! My head is throbbing.

398
00:23:48,918 --> 00:23:51,045
- You got a headache?
- I have a headache!

399
00:23:51,121 --> 00:23:53,989
- Bad?
- Like Oswald in Ghosts.

400
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,458
- Jesus.
- Where are you going?

401
00:23:56,527 --> 00:23:59,929
I'm going to take another
in a series of cold showers.

402
00:24:00,031 --> 00:24:02,363
Max, my serve is going to
send you to the showers early.

403
00:24:02,434 --> 00:24:04,425
Right. To get back to
what we were discussing.

404
00:24:04,503 --> 00:24:07,941
The failure of the country to get
behind New York City is anti-Semitism.

405
00:24:08,008 --> 00:24:09,907
Max, the city is terribly run.

406
00:24:09,976 --> 00:24:13,344
I'm not discussing politics
or economics. This is foreskin.

407
00:24:13,414 --> 00:24:17,510
That's a convenient out. When some group
disagrees with you, it's anti-Semitism.

408
00:24:17,584 --> 00:24:20,110
The rest of the country
looks upon New York...

409
00:24:20,189 --> 00:24:24,092
like we're left-wing, communist,
Jewish, homosexual pornographers.

410
00:24:24,161 --> 00:24:26,755
I think of us that way
sometimes, and I live here.

411
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:31,359
Max, if we lived in California, we
could play outdoors every day in the sun.

412
00:24:31,435 --> 00:24:34,599
Sun is bad for you. Everything
our parents said was good is bad.

413
00:24:34,671 --> 00:24:37,266
Sun, milk, red meat, college.

414
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:40,979
Egad, here he comes.

415
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:47,017
You know Alvy? This is Janet.

416
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:50,682
- This is Annie Hall.
- This is Alvy.

417
00:24:50,758 --> 00:24:54,354
- Who's playing with who here?
- You and me against them?

418
00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:56,522
- That's not fair.
- I can't play too good.

419
00:24:56,598 --> 00:24:58,065
I've had four lessons.

420
00:25:21,027 --> 00:25:23,051
Well...

421
00:25:23,129 --> 00:25:24,620
bye.

422
00:25:28,002 --> 00:25:31,403
- You play very well.
- Oh, yeah? So do you!

423
00:25:31,472 --> 00:25:34,534
God, what a dumb thing to say.

424
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:39,479
You say "You play well," and right
away I have to say, "You play well. "

425
00:25:39,549 --> 00:25:41,709
Oh, God, Annie.

426
00:25:41,783 --> 00:25:44,912
Well. Oh, well!

427
00:25:44,988 --> 00:25:47,424
La-de-dah.

428
00:25:48,392 --> 00:25:50,360
You want a lift?

429
00:25:50,427 --> 00:25:54,956
Oh, why? You got a car?

430
00:25:55,034 --> 00:25:57,831
No, I was going to take a cab.

431
00:25:57,903 --> 00:26:00,395
Oh, no. I have a car.

432
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,375
You have a car?

433
00:26:05,379 --> 00:26:07,372
If you have a car...

434
00:26:07,448 --> 00:26:10,906
then why did you say, "Do you
have a car" like you wanted a lift?

435
00:26:13,389 --> 00:26:15,983
Geez, I don't know. I wasn't-

436
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:21,097
I got this VW out there.

437
00:26:21,165 --> 00:26:22,720
What a jerk.

438
00:26:22,853 --> 00:26:25,686
Would you like a lift?

439
00:26:25,756 --> 00:26:29,922
- Sure. Which way are you going?
- Me? Oh, downtown.

440
00:26:29,995 --> 00:26:31,962
I'm going uptown.

441
00:26:32,031 --> 00:26:34,465
Oh, I'm going uptown, too.

442
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:38,162
- You said you were going
downtown. - Yeah, well-

443
00:26:38,237 --> 00:26:40,673
I can go uptown,
too. I live uptown.

444
00:26:40,741 --> 00:26:44,643
What the hell? It would be nice
having company. I hate driving alone.

445
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,114
How long do you know Janet?
Where do you know her from?

446
00:26:48,183 --> 00:26:50,811
- I'm in her acting class.
- You're an actress!

447
00:26:50,887 --> 00:26:53,081
Well, I do commercials, sort of.

448
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:56,593
You want to watch the road?
You're not from New York, right?

449
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,652
- Chippewa Falls.
- Right.

450
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,791
- Where?
- Wisconsin.

451
00:27:01,865 --> 00:27:05,597
- You're driving a tad rapidly.
- Don't worry. I'm a very good driver.

452
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,939
- You want some gum?
- No, thanks.

453
00:27:10,009 --> 00:27:13,502
- Where is it?
- Don't do that. No, no, watch the road.

454
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,411
I'll get it.
Concentrate, will ya?

455
00:27:15,482 --> 00:27:18,280
- I'll get you a piece.
- Listen. You drive?

456
00:27:18,352 --> 00:27:21,446
Do I drive? No, I got
a problem with driving.

457
00:27:21,522 --> 00:27:23,582
- You do?
- Yeah.

458
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:26,685
I got a license, but I
have too much hostility.

459
00:27:27,964 --> 00:27:30,295
Nice car. You keep it nice.

460
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:33,996
- Can I ask you, is this a sandwich?
- Oh, yeah.

461
00:27:39,244 --> 00:27:43,043
I live over here. Oh, my God,
look! There's a parking space.

462
00:27:48,255 --> 00:27:51,223
That's okay, we can walk
to the curb from here.

463
00:27:52,391 --> 00:27:55,089
You want your tennis
stuff? You want your gear?

464
00:27:55,162 --> 00:27:58,064
Yeah. That's good.
Thanks. Thanks a lot. Well.

465
00:27:58,133 --> 00:27:59,566
Well.

466
00:28:01,468 --> 00:28:03,438
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

467
00:28:03,504 --> 00:28:06,339
You're a wonderful
tennis player...

468
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,934
and you're the worst driver
I've ever seen in my life.

469
00:28:09,011 --> 00:28:12,778
Anyplace. Europe. Anyplace. Asia.

470
00:28:12,849 --> 00:28:15,215
- I love what you're wearing.
- You do? Yeah.

471
00:28:15,285 --> 00:28:19,656
This tie is a present
from Grammy Hall.

472
00:28:19,725 --> 00:28:22,217
Who? Grammy Hall?

473
00:28:22,294 --> 00:28:23,989
Yeah, my grammy.

474
00:28:24,063 --> 00:28:27,227
What did you do, grow up in a Norman
Rockwell painting? Your grammy?

475
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:31,600
- It's pretty silly, isn't it?
- My grammy never gave gifts.

476
00:28:31,671 --> 00:28:34,607
She was too busy getting
raped by Cossacks.

477
00:28:34,675 --> 00:28:36,905
Well, thank you again.

478
00:28:36,977 --> 00:28:38,537
Oh, yeah.

479
00:28:38,613 --> 00:28:42,482
Listen. You want to come upstairs
and have a glass of wine or something?

480
00:28:42,551 --> 00:28:46,010
No, I mean you don't have to.
You're probably late and everything.

481
00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:48,422
No, that would be fine.
I wouldn't mind. Sure.

482
00:28:48,492 --> 00:28:53,122
I got time. I got nothing
until my analyst appointment.

483
00:28:53,197 --> 00:28:55,256
You see an analyst?

484
00:28:55,332 --> 00:28:59,064
- Just for 15 years.
- 15 years?

485
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:01,663
I'm going to give him one more
year, and then I'm going to Lourdes.

486
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,733
15? Nah, come on! Yeah? Really?

487
00:29:04,911 --> 00:29:08,278
Sylvia Plath. Interesting
poetess whose tragic suicide...

488
00:29:08,348 --> 00:29:12,149
was misinterpreted as romantic
by the college-girl mentality.

489
00:29:13,187 --> 00:29:16,851
Right. I don't know. I mean,
some of her poems seem neat.

490
00:29:16,925 --> 00:29:20,257
Neat? I hate to tell
you this is 1975.

491
00:29:20,328 --> 00:29:22,730
"Neat" went out at the
turn of the century.

492
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,098
Who are those photos on the wall?

493
00:29:25,169 --> 00:29:27,865
Oh, you see...

494
00:29:27,938 --> 00:29:32,034
that's my dad, that's Father,
and that's my brother, Duane.

495
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:35,011
Yeah, right. And over
there's Grammy Hall.

496
00:29:35,081 --> 00:29:38,015
- And that's Sadie.
- Who's Sadie?

497
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:43,785
Well, Sadie met Grammy through
Grammy's brother, George.

498
00:29:43,857 --> 00:29:46,190
George was real sweet.
He had that thing.

499
00:29:46,261 --> 00:29:51,698
What is that thing where you fall
asleep in the middle of a sentence?

500
00:29:51,766 --> 00:29:53,700
- Narcolepsy.
- Right.

501
00:29:53,768 --> 00:29:58,571
So anyway, George went to the
union to get his free turkey...

502
00:29:58,642 --> 00:30:02,305
because the union always gave George
this free turkey at Christmastime...

503
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:05,907
because he was shell-shocked
in the first World War.

504
00:30:05,983 --> 00:30:09,976
Anyway, so George is
standing in line...

505
00:30:10,054 --> 00:30:12,454
getting his free turkey...

506
00:30:12,523 --> 00:30:17,588
but the thing is he falls
asleep, and he never wakes up.

507
00:30:17,664 --> 00:30:20,360
So he's dead.

508
00:30:20,433 --> 00:30:22,731
He's dead. Yeah.

509
00:30:22,802 --> 00:30:24,327
Oh, dear.

510
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,170
Well, terrible, huh?
Wouldn't you say?

511
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,971
Pretty awful.

512
00:30:29,044 --> 00:30:32,377
It's a great story, though.
It really made my day.

513
00:30:32,447 --> 00:30:35,542
I think I should get out of
here, 'cause I think I'm imposing.

514
00:30:35,618 --> 00:30:38,747
Really? Maybe-

515
00:30:38,822 --> 00:30:43,123
- You don't have to.
- But I'm all perspired and everything.

516
00:30:43,194 --> 00:30:45,788
Didn't you take a
shower at the club?

517
00:30:45,862 --> 00:30:48,423
No, no. I never shower
in a public place.

518
00:30:48,499 --> 00:30:49,932
Why not?

519
00:30:50,002 --> 00:30:54,132
I don't like to get naked
in front of another man.

520
00:30:54,206 --> 00:30:55,639
I see.

521
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:59,168
I don't like to show my
body to a man of my gender.

522
00:30:59,247 --> 00:31:01,875
- I see, I guess.
- You never know what's going to happen.

523
00:31:01,949 --> 00:31:05,282
- 15 years, huh?
- 15 years, yeah.

524
00:31:05,986 --> 00:31:07,420
God bless.

525
00:31:11,728 --> 00:31:14,128
Well! Well-

526
00:31:15,531 --> 00:31:18,330
You're what Grammy Hall
would call "a real Jew. "

527
00:31:20,972 --> 00:31:22,404
Thank you.

528
00:31:23,575 --> 00:31:26,840
She hates Jews. She thinks
they just make money.

529
00:31:26,911 --> 00:31:30,005
But she's the one, is
she ever. I'm telling you.

530
00:31:34,954 --> 00:31:37,548
So, did you do those
photographs in there?

531
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:42,753
I dabble? Listen to me. What a jerk.
Yeah, I sort of dabble around, you know.

532
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:47,062
You are a great-looking girl. They're
wonderful. They have a quality.

533
00:31:47,136 --> 00:31:51,334
He probably thinks I'm a yo-yo. Well, I would
like to take a serious photography course.

534
00:31:51,407 --> 00:31:53,377
Photography's
interesting because...

535
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:57,778
I wonder what she looks like naked. it's a new art
form. A set of aesthetic criteria have not emerged yet.

536
00:31:57,848 --> 00:32:01,648
I'm not smart enough for him. Hang in there.
You mean whether it's a good photo or not?

537
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:06,680
I don't know what I'm saying. She senses I'm shallow. The
medium enters in as a condition of the art form itself.

538
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:11,729
God, I hope he doesn't turn out to be a schmuck like
the others. Well, to me- I mean- It's all instinctive.

539
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:16,736
I just try to feel it, to get a sense
of it and not think about it so much.

540
00:32:16,804 --> 00:32:22,334
Christ, I sound like FM radio. Relax. Still, you need
aesthetic guidelines to put it in social perspective.

541
00:32:24,145 --> 00:32:27,172
I don't know. I mean, I guess
you must be sort of late.

542
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:31,948
You know, I've got to get
there and begin whining soon.

543
00:32:32,021 --> 00:32:34,013
Are you busy Friday night?

544
00:32:34,091 --> 00:32:37,289
Me? Oh, no.

545
00:32:37,362 --> 00:32:40,593
Oh, I'm sorry, I have something.
What about Saturday night?

546
00:32:42,768 --> 00:32:44,702
Nothing. No, no.

547
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:48,002
You're very popular, I can see.

548
00:32:48,074 --> 00:32:50,008
- I know.
- You have plague?

549
00:32:50,076 --> 00:32:52,602
I meet a lot of jerks.

550
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,671
I meet a lot of jerks, too.

551
00:32:54,748 --> 00:32:57,877
I'm thinking about
getting some cats.

552
00:32:57,952 --> 00:33:01,685
Wait a second! No, no! Oh, shoot!

553
00:33:01,757 --> 00:33:06,218
Saturday night,
I'm going to sing.

554
00:33:06,294 --> 00:33:08,787
You're going to sing?
You sing? No kidding!

555
00:33:08,866 --> 00:33:11,858
- This is my first time.
- Really? Where?

556
00:33:11,935 --> 00:33:14,199
I'd like to come.

557
00:33:14,271 --> 00:33:17,001
- I'm interested. -
No, no. I'm just a-

558
00:33:17,074 --> 00:33:21,103
I'm auditioning at this
club. It's my first time.

559
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,648
That's okay, 'cause I know
exactly what that's like.

560
00:33:23,716 --> 00:33:26,550
You're going to like nightclubs.
They're really a lot of fun.

561
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:34,519
It had to be you

562
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:44,301
It had to be you

563
00:33:45,841 --> 00:33:50,746
I wandered around
And finally found

564
00:33:50,814 --> 00:33:57,311
This somebody who

565
00:33:58,457 --> 00:34:03,954
Could make me be true

566
00:34:04,031 --> 00:34:09,197
Could make me be blue

567
00:34:11,205 --> 00:34:14,267
And even be glad

568
00:34:14,342 --> 00:34:16,903
Just to be sad

569
00:34:18,247 --> 00:34:24,083
Thinking of you

570
00:34:24,287 --> 00:34:27,484
I was awful! I'm so
ashamed! I can't sing.

571
00:34:27,557 --> 00:34:29,652
So the audience
was a tad restless.

572
00:34:29,728 --> 00:34:33,027
What do you mean, "a tad
restless"? My God, they hated me!

573
00:34:33,097 --> 00:34:35,499
No, they didn't. You
have a wonderful voice.

574
00:34:35,568 --> 00:34:37,559
- I'm going to quit.
- I'm not going to let you.

575
00:34:37,636 --> 00:34:40,128
- You have a great voice.
- Do you think so, really?

576
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:44,472
- Yeah! It's terrific.
- I never even took a lesson either.

577
00:34:44,544 --> 00:34:48,004
- Listen, give me a kiss.
- Really?

578
00:34:48,082 --> 00:34:50,745
Why not? Because we're
just going to go home later.

579
00:34:50,819 --> 00:34:53,310
There's going to be all that
tension. We've never kissed before.

580
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:55,481
I'll never know when
to make the right move.

581
00:34:55,557 --> 00:34:58,323
We'll kiss now and get it over
with, and then we'll go eat. Okay?

582
00:34:58,395 --> 00:35:00,760
We'll digest our food better.

583
00:35:02,598 --> 00:35:05,706
Okay? Now we can digest our food.

584
00:35:05,841 --> 00:35:08,002
Corned beef, please.

585
00:35:08,076 --> 00:35:11,204
I'm having pastrami
on white bread...

586
00:35:11,281 --> 00:35:14,250
with mayonnaise,
tomatoes and lettuce.

587
00:35:17,053 --> 00:35:20,113
So, your second wife left you.

588
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,852
Were you depressed about that?

589
00:35:22,927 --> 00:35:26,556
Nothing that a few
mega-vitamins couldn't cure.

590
00:35:26,631 --> 00:35:30,500
- Your first wife, Allison.
- She was nice.

591
00:35:30,569 --> 00:35:33,060
That was my fault.
I was too crazy.

592
00:35:36,977 --> 00:35:40,640
That was so nice! That was nice.

593
00:35:40,715 --> 00:35:44,583
As Balzac said, "There
goes another novel. "

594
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:47,417
You were great.

595
00:35:47,489 --> 00:35:50,049
Oh, yeah? Yeah?

596
00:35:50,126 --> 00:35:54,290
- Yeah, I'm wrecked.
- You're wrecked.

597
00:35:54,364 --> 00:35:58,894
I mean it. I'll never
play the piano again.

598
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:02,098
It was, I don't know. You
really thought it was good?

599
00:36:02,174 --> 00:36:07,636
Good? Yes. No, that was the most
fun I've had without laughing.

600
00:36:07,714 --> 00:36:09,579
Here, you want some?

601
00:36:09,649 --> 00:36:15,145
No, I don't use any
major hallucinogenics.

602
00:36:15,222 --> 00:36:19,683
I took a puff about five
years ago at a party...

603
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,662
and tried to take my
pants off over my head.

604
00:36:25,335 --> 00:36:30,534
I don't do it very often.
It just sort of relaxes me.

605
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:35,936
- You won't believe
this, but- - What?

606
00:36:39,284 --> 00:36:42,252
I'm going to buy
you these books...

607
00:36:42,321 --> 00:36:45,622
because I think you should read
them instead of that cat book.

608
00:36:45,691 --> 00:36:48,456
That's pretty serious stuff.

609
00:36:48,528 --> 00:36:50,961
I'm obsessed with death, I think.

610
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:54,058
It's a big subject with me. I
have a pessimistic view of life.

611
00:36:54,135 --> 00:36:56,502
You should know this about
me if we're going to go out.

612
00:36:56,571 --> 00:36:59,768
I feel that life is divided up
into the horrible and the miserable.

613
00:36:59,841 --> 00:37:01,832
Those are the two categories.

614
00:37:01,911 --> 00:37:06,678
The horrible would be like terminal
cases and blind people, cripples.

615
00:37:06,749 --> 00:37:09,218
I don't know how they get
through life. It's amazing to me.

616
00:37:09,287 --> 00:37:12,084
And the miserable
is everyone else.

617
00:37:12,155 --> 00:37:14,591
So when you go through life, be
thankful that you're miserable.

618
00:37:14,658 --> 00:37:17,354
You're very lucky
to be miserable.

619
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:23,766
Look at that guy. There's
Mr. Miami Beach in the pink.

620
00:37:23,836 --> 00:37:26,600
He's just come back from
the gin rummy finals.

621
00:37:26,672 --> 00:37:28,504
He placed third.

622
00:37:28,575 --> 00:37:31,602
Look at these guys. That's hilarious.
They're back from Fire Island.

623
00:37:31,678 --> 00:37:34,546
They're sort of giving
it a chance romantically.

624
00:37:34,615 --> 00:37:37,516
- Italian, right?
- Him? He's the Mafia.

625
00:37:37,585 --> 00:37:40,920
Linen supply business or
cement and contracting.

626
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:44,585
Oh, gee, mess up
my moustache wax.

627
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:47,458
There's the winner of the
Truman Capote look-alike contest.

628
00:37:47,564 --> 00:37:52,333
You are unbelievably
sexy. Yes, you are.

629
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:56,271
You know what you are? You're
polymorphously perverse.

630
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,866
What does that mean? I
don't know what that is.

631
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:01,880
You're exceptional in bed...

632
00:38:01,948 --> 00:38:04,940
because you get pleasure in every
part of your body when I touch it.

633
00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:08,852
Like the tip of your nose, and if I
stroke your teeth or your knee caps...

634
00:38:08,921 --> 00:38:11,084
you certainly get excited.

635
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:15,494
You know what? I
like you, I really do.

636
00:38:15,564 --> 00:38:18,499
But do you love me?
That's the key question.

637
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:20,900
I know you've only
known me a short while.

638
00:38:20,971 --> 00:38:24,931
I think that's sort of
- Yeah, yeah.

639
00:38:25,009 --> 00:38:26,943
Do you love me?

640
00:38:27,011 --> 00:38:32,473
Love is too weak a word for what
- I "lurve" you.

641
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:36,852
I "loave" you. I "luff"
you, with two "f"s.

642
00:38:36,923 --> 00:38:39,084
Of course I do.
Don't you think I do?

643
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:41,252
I don't know.

644
00:38:43,129 --> 00:38:45,997
What do you mean? You're not going to
give up your own apartment, are you?

645
00:38:46,066 --> 00:38:48,000
- Of course.
- But why?

646
00:38:48,068 --> 00:38:50,332
I'm moving in with
you, that's why.

647
00:38:50,404 --> 00:38:53,465
- But you have a nice apartment.
- I have a tiny apartment.

648
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:56,569
- I know it's small.
- And it's got bad plumbing and bugs.

649
00:38:56,646 --> 00:39:01,550
Granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs.
You say that like it's a negative.

650
00:39:01,618 --> 00:39:03,813
Bugs are-

651
00:39:03,887 --> 00:39:07,757
- Entomology is a rapidly growing field.
- You don't want me to live with you.

652
00:39:07,826 --> 00:39:11,784
- I don't? Whose idea was it?
- Mine.

653
00:39:11,863 --> 00:39:14,196
It was yours, actually.

654
00:39:14,266 --> 00:39:16,598
But I approved it immediately.

655
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,604
You think I talked
you into something.

656
00:39:18,673 --> 00:39:23,234
No. We live together, we sleep
together, we eat together.

657
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,608
Jesus, you don't want it to
be like we're married, do you?

658
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:29,640
- How is it any different?
- Because you keep your own apartment.

659
00:39:29,718 --> 00:39:32,243
It's there. We don't have
to go to it, deal with it...

660
00:39:32,321 --> 00:39:37,419
but it's like a free-floating life raft
that we know that we're not married.

661
00:39:37,492 --> 00:39:39,985
That little apartment
is $400 a month, Alvy.

662
00:39:40,064 --> 00:39:43,192
- That place is $400 a month?
- Yes, it is.

663
00:39:43,266 --> 00:39:46,362
It's got bad plumbing
and bugs. Jesus.

664
00:39:46,438 --> 00:39:50,433
My accountant will write it off as
a tax deduction. I'll pay for it.

665
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:53,138
You don't think I'm smart
enough to be serious about.

666
00:39:53,212 --> 00:39:54,873
Don't be ridiculous.

667
00:39:54,947 --> 00:39:59,214
Then why are you always pushing me to
take college courses like I was dumb?

668
00:39:59,286 --> 00:40:01,448
Adult education is
a wonderful thing!

669
00:40:01,522 --> 00:40:04,787
You meet a lot of interesting
professors. It's stimulating.

670
00:40:17,407 --> 00:40:21,708
Does this sound like a good
course: "Modern American Poetry"?

671
00:40:22,781 --> 00:40:24,748
Or, let's see...

672
00:40:24,815 --> 00:40:28,912
maybe I should take
"Introduction to the Novel. "

673
00:40:28,987 --> 00:40:31,616
Just don't take any course
where they make you read Beowulf.

674
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,750
What?

675
00:40:33,826 --> 00:40:38,230
What do you think? Should we go
to that party in South Hampton?

676
00:40:38,299 --> 00:40:41,758
No, don't be silly. What
do we need other people for?

677
00:40:41,836 --> 00:40:46,706
We should just turn out the lights
and play hide the "salam" or something.

678
00:40:46,776 --> 00:40:49,746
Well, I'm going to
get a cigarette, okay?

679
00:40:49,812 --> 00:40:55,046
Grass, right? The illusion that it makes
a white woman more like Billie Holiday.

680
00:40:55,118 --> 00:40:58,282
- Have you ever made love high?
- Me? No.

681
00:40:58,357 --> 00:41:02,020
If I have grass or alcohol,
I get unbearably wonderful.

682
00:41:02,094 --> 00:41:05,087
I get too wonderful for words.

683
00:41:05,164 --> 00:41:09,101
I don't know why you have to
get high every time we make love.

684
00:41:09,169 --> 00:41:11,035
It relaxes me.

685
00:41:11,105 --> 00:41:13,665
You have to be artificially
relaxed before we can go to bed?

686
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,903
What's the difference, anyway?

687
00:41:15,977 --> 00:41:18,605
I'll give you a shot of Sodium
Pentothal. You can sleep through it.

688
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,047
Look who's talking! You've been
seeing a psychiatrist for 15 years.

689
00:41:22,118 --> 00:41:25,678
You should smoke some of this.
You'd be off the couch in no time.

690
00:41:25,754 --> 00:41:27,986
- Come on, you don't need that.
- What are you doing?

691
00:41:28,058 --> 00:41:31,755
- No, Alvy, please?
- You can live without it once.

692
00:41:33,732 --> 00:41:35,824
Wait, I got a great idea.

693
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:41,767
Hang in there for a second. I
got a little erotic artifact...

694
00:41:41,841 --> 00:41:45,937
that I brought up from the city,
which I think is going to be perfect.

695
00:41:46,011 --> 00:41:49,846
There. Create a little
old New Orleans essence.

696
00:41:49,916 --> 00:41:53,114
Now we can go about
our business...

697
00:41:53,187 --> 00:41:56,088
and even develop
photographs if we want to.

698
00:42:03,266 --> 00:42:06,030
- Is something wrong?
- No, why?

699
00:42:06,102 --> 00:42:09,038
I don't know. It's
like you're removed.

700
00:42:09,104 --> 00:42:11,075
No, I'm fine.

701
00:42:11,142 --> 00:42:13,134
Really?

702
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:15,839
I don't know. You
seem sort of distant.

703
00:42:15,914 --> 00:42:17,973
Let's just do it, all right?

704
00:42:18,049 --> 00:42:21,508
Was it my imagination or are you
just going through the motions?

705
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,886
Alvy, do you remember
where I put my drawing pad?

706
00:42:23,991 --> 00:42:26,925
Because while you two are doing
that, I'm going to do some drawing.

707
00:42:26,993 --> 00:42:29,258
That's what I call removed!

708
00:42:29,329 --> 00:42:32,322
You have my body.

709
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,698
But I want the whole thing!

710
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:36,704
I need grass.

711
00:42:36,772 --> 00:42:39,707
It ruins it for me
if you have grass.

712
00:42:39,775 --> 00:42:43,109
I'm like a comedian, so if I get
a laugh from a person who's high...

713
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,013
it doesn't count, 'cause
they're always laughing.

714
00:42:46,082 --> 00:42:48,017
Were you always funny?

715
00:42:48,084 --> 00:42:50,746
Is this an interview? We're
supposed to be making love.

716
00:42:50,921 --> 00:42:54,189
This guy is naturally funny.
I think he can write for you.

717
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:57,126
Yeah, yeah. Hey, kid, he
tells me you're really good.

718
00:42:57,196 --> 00:42:59,597
Let me explain how I work.
You can tell off the bat...

719
00:42:59,665 --> 00:43:02,567
that I don't look like a funny
guy like some of the guys.

720
00:43:02,634 --> 00:43:05,002
You know they're going to tell you
their stories, you're going to fall down.

721
00:43:05,072 --> 00:43:07,837
But I gotta be really talented.
Material's got to be sensational for me.

722
00:43:07,909 --> 00:43:11,845
I work
- I'm kind of classy. Know what I mean?

723
00:43:11,913 --> 00:43:14,245
Let me explain. I'll
open with an opening song.

724
00:43:14,316 --> 00:43:16,308
The music will start.

725
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:19,183
I walk out. Place looks
wonderful from here

726
00:43:19,255 --> 00:43:21,986
You folks look
wonderful from here

727
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:24,653
And seeing you there
With a smile on your face

728
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:27,095
Makes me shout This
must be the place

729
00:43:27,164 --> 00:43:30,260
I stop, and then I open with some
jokes. That's where I need you.

730
00:43:30,335 --> 00:43:34,067
I'll say, "I just got back from
Canada. They speak a lot of French.

731
00:43:34,139 --> 00:43:38,133
The only word to know is 'John Dark. '
It means the light's out in the bathroom.

732
00:43:38,212 --> 00:43:42,580
- I met a big lumberjack. "
- Jesus, this guy's pathetic.

733
00:43:42,649 --> 00:43:46,312
Look at him mincing around.
Boy, thinks he's real cute.

734
00:43:46,386 --> 00:43:48,685
You want to throw up.

735
00:43:48,757 --> 00:43:51,749
If only I had the nerve
to do my own jokes.

736
00:43:53,495 --> 00:43:56,760
I don't know how much longer I can
keep this smile frozen on my face.

737
00:43:56,832 --> 00:43:58,801
I'm in the wrong
business. I know it.

738
00:43:58,868 --> 00:44:02,771
"But, cherie...

739
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,502
what will I do with this, eh?"

740
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:09,571
He says, "Oh, Marie,
sometime you make me so mad!"

741
00:44:09,649 --> 00:44:11,674
They scream at that. Write me
something like that, will you?

742
00:44:11,751 --> 00:44:14,445
Kind of a French
number. Can you do it?

743
00:44:20,686 --> 00:44:22,778
Where am I? I have
to reorient myself.

744
00:44:22,855 --> 00:44:24,847
This is the University
of Wisconsin, right?

745
00:44:24,923 --> 00:44:29,588
Because I'm always tense
when I'm playing a college.

746
00:44:29,663 --> 00:44:32,064
I have a bad history with colleges.
I went to New York University.

747
00:44:32,165 --> 00:44:36,126
And I was thrown out of
NYU my freshman year...

748
00:44:36,203 --> 00:44:39,503
for cheating on my
metaphysics final.

749
00:44:39,574 --> 00:44:43,909
I looked within the soul of
the boy sitting next to me.

750
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:48,178
My mother, an emotionally high-strung
woman, locked herself in the bathroom...

751
00:44:48,251 --> 00:44:51,346
and took an overdose
of mah-jongg tiles.

752
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:58,427
I was depressed at that
time. I was in analysis.

753
00:44:58,496 --> 00:45:02,296
I was suicidal, as a matter of
fact, and would have killed myself...

754
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:05,031
but I was in analysis
with a strict Freudian.

755
00:45:05,105 --> 00:45:08,769
And if you kill yourself, they make
you pay for the sessions you miss.

756
00:45:12,612 --> 00:45:16,709
Alvy, you were just
great. I'm not kidding.

757
00:45:16,784 --> 00:45:19,583
College audiences are wonderful.

758
00:45:19,655 --> 00:45:22,784
You know what? I think I'm starting
to get more of the references, too.

759
00:45:22,858 --> 00:45:26,989
Are you? The 12:00 show is
completely different than the 9:00.

760
00:45:27,063 --> 00:45:31,330
I'm looking forward to tomorrow. It'll
be nice. You'll meet Mother and Father.

761
00:45:31,403 --> 00:45:33,529
They'll hate me immediately.

762
00:45:34,638 --> 00:45:38,075
No, I don't think they're going
to hate you at all. Contrary.

763
00:45:38,143 --> 00:45:42,604
It's Easter. We'll sit down and
eat. I think they'll really like you.

764
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:53,521
It's a nice ham this year, Mom.

765
00:45:55,764 --> 00:45:58,758
Grammy always does
such a good job.

766
00:45:58,834 --> 00:46:00,631
Great sauce.

767
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:03,171
It is. It's dynamite ham.

768
00:46:08,746 --> 00:46:11,648
We went to the swap meet.

769
00:46:11,717 --> 00:46:14,810
Annie, Gram and I. Got
some nice picture frames.

770
00:46:14,886 --> 00:46:18,379
We really had a good time.

771
00:46:18,456 --> 00:46:22,828
Ann tells us you've been seeing
a psychiatrist for 15 years.

772
00:46:23,998 --> 00:46:25,989
Yes. I'm making
excellent progress.

773
00:46:26,065 --> 00:46:29,366
Soon, when I lie down on his couch,
I won't have to wear the lobster bib.

774
00:46:31,641 --> 00:46:35,304
- Duane and I went to the boat basin.
- We caulked hulls all day.

775
00:46:35,378 --> 00:46:38,370
And Randolph Hunt
was drunk as usual.

776
00:46:38,446 --> 00:46:42,976
That Randolph Hunt! You
remember Randy Hunt, Annie.

777
00:46:43,053 --> 00:46:45,818
- He was in the choir with you.
- Oh, yes.

778
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:48,414
I can't believe this family.

779
00:46:48,492 --> 00:46:51,361
Annie's mother is
really beautiful.

780
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:55,127
And they're talking swap
meets and boat basins.

781
00:46:55,201 --> 00:46:59,968
The old lady at the end of the
table is a classic Jew-hater.

782
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:04,672
They really look American, healthy,
like they never get sick or anything.

783
00:47:04,745 --> 00:47:07,942
Nothing like my family. The
two are like oil and water.

784
00:47:08,317 --> 00:47:11,217
Ah, let him drop dead.
Who needs his business?

785
00:47:11,285 --> 00:47:16,919
- His wife has diabetes.
- Diabetes? Is that an excuse?

786
00:47:16,993 --> 00:47:21,396
The man is 50 years old and
doesn't have a substantial job.

787
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:23,194
Is that a reason to
steal from your partner?

788
00:47:23,267 --> 00:47:25,736
You don't know what
you're talking about.

789
00:47:25,804 --> 00:47:27,464
Defend him!

790
00:47:27,538 --> 00:47:30,201
Pass the brisket.

791
00:47:30,275 --> 00:47:32,836
Mo Moskowitz. He had a coronary.

792
00:47:32,912 --> 00:47:34,847
You don't say!

793
00:47:35,848 --> 00:47:38,079
How do you plan to spend
the holidays, Mrs. Singer?

794
00:47:38,151 --> 00:47:40,209
- We fast.
- Fast?

795
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:43,553
No food. You know,
to atone for our sins.

796
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:45,718
What sins? I don't understand.

797
00:47:45,794 --> 00:47:47,658
Neither do we.

798
00:47:49,732 --> 00:47:52,496
Hi, Duane. How's it going?

799
00:47:52,567 --> 00:47:56,597
- This is my room.
- Oh, yeah? It's terrific.

800
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:58,665
Can I confess something?

801
00:48:04,148 --> 00:48:07,414
I tell you this, because, as an
artist, I think you'll understand.

802
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:13,383
Sometimes when I'm driving...

803
00:48:13,459 --> 00:48:15,427
on the road at night...

804
00:48:15,495 --> 00:48:18,955
I see two headlights
coming toward me, fast.

805
00:48:19,033 --> 00:48:21,434
I have this impulse to
turn the wheel quickly...

806
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,767
head-on into the oncoming car.

807
00:48:24,907 --> 00:48:27,101
I can anticipate the explosion.

808
00:48:27,175 --> 00:48:31,341
The sound of shattering glass.

809
00:48:31,415 --> 00:48:35,818
The flames rising out
of the flowing gasoline.

810
00:48:38,522 --> 00:48:39,956
Right.

811
00:48:41,326 --> 00:48:47,061
I have to go now, Duane, because
I'm due back on the planet Earth.

812
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,066
Don't let it be so long now.

813
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:52,765
- Look up Uncle Billy, promise.
- He is adorable.

814
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,308
- You'll take them to the airport now?
- No. Duane can.

815
00:48:55,376 --> 00:48:58,139
- I haven't finished my drink.
- Yes, Duane is. I'll be right-

816
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:20,132
You followed me.
I can't believe it!

817
00:49:20,205 --> 00:49:22,173
- I didn't follow you.
- You followed me!

818
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:25,768
Because I was walking a block behind
staring at you? That's not following.

819
00:49:25,845 --> 00:49:29,508
- What's your definition of "following"?
- Following is different. I was spying.

820
00:49:29,582 --> 00:49:31,072
Do you realize how
paranoid you are?

821
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:34,212
Paranoid? I'm looking at you, and
you've got your arms around another guy.

822
00:49:34,288 --> 00:49:36,280
That is the worst
kind of paranoid!

823
00:49:36,357 --> 00:49:39,724
I didn't start out spying. I thought I'd
surprise you, pick you up after school.

824
00:49:39,794 --> 00:49:43,663
You wanted to keep the relationship
flexible, remember? It's your phrase.

825
00:49:43,732 --> 00:49:45,793
You're having an affair
with your college professor!

826
00:49:45,869 --> 00:49:50,534
That jerk that teaches that crap course,
"Contemporary Crisis in Western Man. "

827
00:49:50,608 --> 00:49:53,371
"Existential Motifs in Russian
Literature. " You're really close.

828
00:49:53,443 --> 00:49:55,710
What's the difference? It's
all mental masturbation.

829
00:49:55,782 --> 00:49:58,408
Now we're getting to a subject
you know something about.

830
00:49:58,483 --> 00:50:01,453
Don't knock masturbation.
It's sex with someone I love.

831
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:06,255
We're not having an affair. He's
married. He happens to think I'm neat.

832
00:50:06,326 --> 00:50:09,420
Are you 12 years old? That's one
of your Chippewa Falls expressions.

833
00:50:09,496 --> 00:50:11,259
Who cares?

834
00:50:11,331 --> 00:50:14,994
Next he'll find you're keen and peachy.
Then he'll have his hand on your ass.

835
00:50:15,069 --> 00:50:18,098
You've had hostility towards
David ever since I mentioned him.

836
00:50:18,174 --> 00:50:20,335
- You call your teacher David?
- It's his name.

837
00:50:20,409 --> 00:50:24,004
It's a Biblical name, right?
Does he call you Bathsheba?

838
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:28,246
Alvy, you're the one who never
wanted to make a real commitment.

839
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,379
You don't think I'm smart enough.
We had that argument last month...

840
00:50:31,456 --> 00:50:34,186
or don't you remember that day?

841
00:50:35,661 --> 00:50:38,391
- I'm home!
- How'd it go?

842
00:50:38,465 --> 00:50:41,434
It was really weird, but
she's a very nice woman.

843
00:50:41,501 --> 00:50:45,164
I didn't have to lie on the
couch. She had me sitting up.

844
00:50:45,238 --> 00:50:49,141
I told her about the family
and my feelings towards men...

845
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:51,372
and my relationship
with my brother.

846
00:50:51,446 --> 00:50:54,176
Then she mentioned penis
envy. Do you know about that?

847
00:50:54,249 --> 00:50:58,549
I'm one of the few males
who suffers from that. Go on.

848
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:03,150
She said I was guilty about my
impulses towards marriage and children.

849
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:07,823
Then, I remembered, when I was a kid, I
accidentally saw my parents making love.

850
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,423
All this happened the
first hour? That's amazing.

851
00:51:10,501 --> 00:51:14,131
I've been going for 15 years.
I don't have nothing like that.

852
00:51:14,205 --> 00:51:16,470
I told her my dream,
and then I cried.

853
00:51:16,542 --> 00:51:20,070
You cried. I've never once
cried. That's fantastic to me.

854
00:51:20,147 --> 00:51:22,308
I whine. I sit and I whine.

855
00:51:22,382 --> 00:51:26,251
In my dream, Frank Sinatra is
holding this pillow across my face...

856
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,254
and I can't breathe.

857
00:51:28,321 --> 00:51:30,552
He's strangling me.

858
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:33,528
Sure, because he's a singer, and
you're a singer. It's perfect.

859
00:51:33,596 --> 00:51:36,565
You're trying to suffocate
yourself. It makes perfect sense.

860
00:51:36,632 --> 00:51:38,965
That's a perfect
analytic insight.

861
00:51:39,036 --> 00:51:42,631
She said your name
was Alvy Singer.

862
00:51:42,706 --> 00:51:44,697
- What do you mean, me?
- Yeah, you.

863
00:51:44,775 --> 00:51:47,972
Because in the dream, I
break Sinatra's glasses.

864
00:51:48,045 --> 00:51:52,745
You never said Sinatra had glasses.
Are you saying I'm suffocating you?

865
00:51:52,817 --> 00:51:56,118
God, I did this really
terrible thing to him...

866
00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:00,819
because then when he sang, it
was in this real high-pitch voice.

867
00:52:00,893 --> 00:52:04,591
- What'd the doctor say?
- I should come five times a week.

868
00:52:04,665 --> 00:52:09,968
I don't think I mind analysis at all.
The question is, will it change my wife?

869
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:12,701
- Will it change your wife?
- Will it change my life?

870
00:52:12,776 --> 00:52:16,268
- But you said "wife. "
- No, I said "life. "

871
00:52:16,313 --> 00:52:18,338
- No, you said "wife. "
- "Life!" I said "life. "

872
00:52:18,415 --> 00:52:22,181
She said "wife. " You heard that,
because you were there. I'm not crazy.

873
00:52:22,252 --> 00:52:26,155
Then I told her I didn't think
you'd ever take me seriously...

874
00:52:26,224 --> 00:52:28,660
because you don't
think I'm smart enough.

875
00:52:28,727 --> 00:52:32,892
Why do you bring that up? Because I
encourage you to take adult education?

876
00:52:32,966 --> 00:52:36,562
It's a wonderful thing. You meet
wonderful, interesting professors.

877
00:52:36,704 --> 00:52:40,641
Adult education is junk. The
professors are phony. How can you do it?

878
00:52:40,708 --> 00:52:43,575
I don't care what you say about
David. He's a fine teacher.

879
00:52:43,644 --> 00:52:48,412
And why are you following me around?
We should call this relationship quits.

880
00:52:48,483 --> 00:52:51,579
That's fine. That's great. I
don't know what I did wrong.

881
00:52:51,655 --> 00:52:55,489
Somewhere she cooled off to
me. Is it something that I did?

882
00:52:55,559 --> 00:52:59,017
It's never something you do.
That's how people are. Love fades.

883
00:52:59,097 --> 00:53:02,066
Love fades. God, that's
a depressing thought.

884
00:53:02,132 --> 00:53:04,398
I have to ask you a question.
Don't go any further.

885
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:07,962
With your wife, in bed, does she need
some kind of artificial stimulation...

886
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,202
like marijuana?

887
00:53:10,277 --> 00:53:12,905
We use a large vibrating egg.

888
00:53:12,979 --> 00:53:14,844
A large vibrating egg.

889
00:53:14,914 --> 00:53:18,942
I ask a psychopath, I get
that kind of answer. Jesus!

890
00:53:19,019 --> 00:53:22,048
You look like a
very happy couple.

891
00:53:22,124 --> 00:53:24,354
- Are you?
- Yeah.

892
00:53:24,426 --> 00:53:26,895
How do you account for it?

893
00:53:26,963 --> 00:53:30,899
I'm very shallow and empty,
and I have no ideas...

894
00:53:30,967 --> 00:53:33,198
and nothing interesting to say.

895
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:36,569
- I'm exactly the same way.
- I see.

896
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,633
That's interesting. So you've
managed to work out something?

897
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:41,143
Right.

898
00:53:41,211 --> 00:53:44,011
Thanks for talking to me.

899
00:53:44,083 --> 00:53:48,042
Even as a kid, I went for the wrong
women. I think that's my problem.

900
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,282
When my mother took
me to see Snow White...

901
00:53:50,357 --> 00:53:54,818
everyone fell in love with Snow
White, and I fell for the wicked queen.

902
00:53:54,961 --> 00:53:58,227
- We never have any fun anymore.
- How can you say that?

903
00:53:58,299 --> 00:54:00,825
Why not? You're always leaning
on me to improve myself.

904
00:54:00,903 --> 00:54:03,269
You're upset. You must
be getting your period.

905
00:54:03,339 --> 00:54:08,039
I don't get a period. I'm a cartoon
character. Can't I be upset sometimes?

906
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:12,014
Max, forget about Annie. I
know lots of women you can date.

907
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:14,107
I don't want to go
out with other women.

908
00:54:14,552 --> 00:54:17,215
Max, I've got a girl for you. You are going to
love her. She's a reporter for Rolling Stone.

909
00:54:19,792 --> 00:54:21,782
There are more people here
to see the Maharishi...

910
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:24,522
than there were to
see the Dylan concert.

911
00:54:24,596 --> 00:54:27,795
I covered the Dylan concert,
which gave me chills.

912
00:54:27,868 --> 00:54:33,238
Especially when he sang, "She
takes just like a woman...

913
00:54:33,307 --> 00:54:36,209
and she makes love
just like a woman.

914
00:54:36,277 --> 00:54:38,245
Yes, she does.

915
00:54:38,314 --> 00:54:41,613
And she aches just
like a woman...

916
00:54:41,684 --> 00:54:44,983
but she breaks just
like a little girl. "

917
00:54:45,054 --> 00:54:48,024
Up to that, the most
charismatic event I covered...

918
00:54:48,091 --> 00:54:50,720
was Mick's birthday when the
Stones played Madison Square Garden.

919
00:54:50,795 --> 00:54:52,422
That's just great.

920
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,658
You catch Dylan?

921
00:54:54,732 --> 00:54:58,031
No, I couldn't make it.
My raccoon had hepatitis.

922
00:54:58,103 --> 00:55:00,038
You have a raccoon?

923
00:55:00,106 --> 00:55:01,539
A few.

924
00:55:01,608 --> 00:55:04,509
The only word for this
is "transplendent. "

925
00:55:04,576 --> 00:55:08,343
- It's transplendent.
- I can think of another word.

926
00:55:08,415 --> 00:55:11,044
He's God. I mean,
this man is God.

927
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:13,849
He's got millions of followers,
who would crawl across the world...

928
00:55:13,922 --> 00:55:15,890
just to touch the
hem of his garment.

929
00:55:15,957 --> 00:55:17,891
It must be a tremendous hem.

930
00:55:17,959 --> 00:55:20,827
- I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
- Are you?

931
00:55:20,897 --> 00:55:25,096
I can't get with any religion that
advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look.

932
00:55:25,169 --> 00:55:27,467
There's God coming
out of the men's room.

933
00:55:27,538 --> 00:55:30,268
It's unbelievably transplendent!

934
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:33,572
I was at the Stones' concert when
they killed that guy. Remember?

935
00:55:33,645 --> 00:55:36,706
Were you? I was at an
Alice Cooper thing...

936
00:55:36,782 --> 00:55:40,013
where six people were rushed
to the hospital with bad vibes.

937
00:55:41,053 --> 00:55:43,488
I hope you don't mind that
I took so long to finish.

938
00:55:43,557 --> 00:55:46,652
Me? No. Don't be silly.

939
00:55:48,328 --> 00:55:52,265
I'm starting to get some
feeling back in my jaw now.

940
00:55:53,402 --> 00:55:56,838
Sex with you is really
a Kafkaesque experience.

941
00:55:58,307 --> 00:56:00,003
Thank you.

942
00:56:00,076 --> 00:56:02,544
I mean that as a compliment.

943
00:56:02,611 --> 00:56:07,016
I think there's too much
burden placed on the orgasm...

944
00:56:07,084 --> 00:56:10,384
to make up for
empty areas in life.

945
00:56:12,189 --> 00:56:14,160
Who said that?

946
00:56:16,897 --> 00:56:19,729
I don't know. I think it may
have been Leopold and Loeb.

947
00:56:24,773 --> 00:56:26,206
Hello.

948
00:56:31,279 --> 00:56:34,511
No. What's the matter?

949
00:56:36,118 --> 00:56:38,781
You sound terrible.

950
00:56:38,855 --> 00:56:41,221
No, what-
Sure, I-

951
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:43,523
What kind of emergency?

952
00:56:43,594 --> 00:56:47,394
No, stay there. I'll
come over right now.

953
00:56:47,465 --> 00:56:49,764
Just stay there.
I'll come right over.

954
00:56:49,902 --> 00:56:52,303
It's me. Open up. Are you okay?

955
00:56:52,371 --> 00:56:54,965
What's the matter?
Are you all right?

956
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,407
There's a spider in the bathroom.

957
00:56:57,477 --> 00:57:01,209
- What?
- There's a big spider in the bathroom.

958
00:57:02,917 --> 00:57:06,877
You got me here at 3:00 a. m.
'cause a spider's in the bathroom?

959
00:57:06,955 --> 00:57:11,415
You know how I am about insects. I can't
sleep with that thing crawling around.

960
00:57:11,493 --> 00:57:13,984
Kill it! What's wrong with you?

961
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:17,123
Don't you have Raid in the house?

962
00:57:17,201 --> 00:57:22,071
I told you a thousand times
to keep a lot of insect spray.

963
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,507
- You never know who will crawl over.
- I know.

964
00:57:24,577 --> 00:57:26,703
And a first aid kit
and fire extinguisher.

965
00:57:26,779 --> 00:57:29,247
Give me a magazine,
'cause I'm a little tired.

966
00:57:29,314 --> 00:57:32,547
You make fun of me, but
I'm prepared for anything.

967
00:57:32,619 --> 00:57:35,348
An emergency, a tidal
wave, an earthquake.

968
00:57:36,189 --> 00:57:39,681
What is this? Did you
go to a rock concert?

969
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,194
Yeah.

970
00:57:41,263 --> 00:57:44,926
Really? How'd you like it?

971
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,198
Was it heavy? Did it
achieve total "heavyosity"?

972
00:57:49,271 --> 00:57:51,672
It was just great!

973
00:57:51,741 --> 00:57:55,109
I've got an idea. Call the guy
who took you to the rock concert...

974
00:57:55,179 --> 00:57:57,613
and he can come
and kill the spider.

975
00:57:57,682 --> 00:58:00,308
I called you. You
want to help me or not?

976
00:58:00,384 --> 00:58:04,151
Since when do you read the National
Review? What are you turning into?

977
00:58:04,222 --> 00:58:07,386
I like to get all points of view.

978
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:10,224
Wonderful. Get William F.
Buckley to kill the spider.

979
00:58:10,296 --> 00:58:13,323
You're a little
hostile, you know that?

980
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,336
Not only that, you
look thin and tired.

981
00:58:16,404 --> 00:58:19,703
It's 3:00 in the morning.
You got me out of bed.

982
00:58:19,774 --> 00:58:22,868
I ran over. I couldn't get a
taxi. You said it was an emergency.

983
00:58:22,945 --> 00:58:25,005
I ran up the stairs.

984
00:58:25,081 --> 00:58:28,414
I was more attractive
when the evening began.

985
00:58:28,485 --> 00:58:31,454
Are you going with a
right-wing rock-and-roll star?

986
00:58:31,522 --> 00:58:34,354
Would you like a glass
of chocolate milk?

987
00:58:34,424 --> 00:58:39,193
- What am I, your son? I came over
for- - I've got the good chocolate.

988
00:58:39,264 --> 00:58:42,198
- Where's the spider?
- It's in the bathroom.

989
00:58:42,266 --> 00:58:46,261
Don't squish it. After it's dead,
flush it down the toilet, okay?

990
00:58:46,339 --> 00:58:49,776
I've been killing spiders
since I was 30. Okay?

991
00:58:54,315 --> 00:58:58,014
It's a very big spider. A lot
of trouble. There's two of 'em.

992
00:58:58,087 --> 00:59:00,520
I didn't think it was that
big, but it's a major spider.

993
00:59:00,589 --> 00:59:05,288
- You got a broom or snow shovel?
- I left it at your house. I'm sorry.

994
00:59:05,362 --> 00:59:07,296
What are you doing?

995
00:59:07,364 --> 00:59:09,958
There's a spider in your
bathroom the size of a Buick.

996
00:59:17,642 --> 00:59:21,909
- You got black soap?
- It's for my complexion.

997
00:59:21,981 --> 00:59:25,110
Are you joining a minstrel show?

998
00:59:32,794 --> 00:59:34,227
Don't worry.

999
00:59:43,407 --> 00:59:46,204
I did it. I killed them
both. What's the matter?

1000
00:59:46,275 --> 00:59:50,771
What are you sad about? Did you want
me to capture and rehabilitate 'em?

1001
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:53,977
- Don't go, please.
- What do you mean?

1002
00:59:54,052 --> 00:59:57,385
What's the matter? Are
you expecting termites?

1003
00:59:57,456 --> 00:59:59,720
What's the matter?

1004
00:59:59,792 --> 01:00:02,489
I don't know. I miss you.

1005
01:00:02,562 --> 01:00:05,361
Jesus! Really?

1006
01:00:12,274 --> 01:00:14,504
- Alvy?
- What?

1007
01:00:16,111 --> 01:00:20,172
Was there somebody in your
room when I called you?

1008
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:23,880
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I thought I heard a voice.

1009
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:27,981
I had the radio on. I'm
sorry, it was the television.

1010
01:00:33,932 --> 01:00:38,735
Let's never break up again.
I don't want to be apart.

1011
01:00:38,806 --> 01:00:43,470
I think we're both much too
mature for something like that.

1012
01:00:43,544 --> 01:00:46,378
Living together hasn't
been so bad, has it?

1013
01:00:46,447 --> 01:00:49,646
For me it's been
terrific. You know?

1014
01:00:49,718 --> 01:00:52,277
Better than either
of my marriages.

1015
01:00:52,354 --> 01:00:56,723
There's something different about
you. I don't know what, but it's great.

1016
01:00:56,793 --> 01:01:02,425
I think, if you let me, I
could help you have more fun.

1017
01:01:02,499 --> 01:01:05,593
I know it's hard. Yeah.

1018
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:09,334
What if we go away this weekend?

1019
01:01:09,408 --> 01:01:12,968
Why don't we get Rob, and the three
of us would drive into Brooklyn?

1020
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:15,707
We could show you the old
neighborhood. That'd be fun for you.

1021
01:01:15,781 --> 01:01:17,875
Yeah, I'd love it.

1022
01:01:18,853 --> 01:01:21,116
God, it's a great day!

1023
01:01:21,188 --> 01:01:24,955
Watch the road!
You'll total the car!

1024
01:01:25,026 --> 01:01:27,153
I've never been to Brooklyn.

1025
01:01:27,229 --> 01:01:29,824
- I can't wait to see the neighborhood.
- The neighborhood will be great.

1026
01:01:29,899 --> 01:01:33,129
- We could show her the schoolyard.
- I was a great athlete. Tell her.

1027
01:01:33,202 --> 01:01:35,864
I was all-schoolyard.

1028
01:01:35,938 --> 01:01:39,102
They threw him a football
once. He tried to dribble it.

1029
01:01:39,176 --> 01:01:40,768
I used to lose my glasses a lot.

1030
01:01:40,844 --> 01:01:44,507
Look! That's my old house.
That's where I used to live.

1031
01:01:44,581 --> 01:01:46,015
Holy cow!

1032
01:01:47,185 --> 01:01:50,315
You're lucky. Where I used to live
is now a pornographic equipment store.

1033
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:52,620
I had some very
good memories there.

1034
01:01:52,692 --> 01:01:55,786
What good memories, your mother
and father fighting all the time?

1035
01:01:55,861 --> 01:01:58,422
And over the most
ridiculous things.

1036
01:01:58,565 --> 01:02:01,091
- You fired the cleaning woman?
- She was stealing!

1037
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:03,694
But she's colored. The
colored have enough trouble!

1038
01:02:03,771 --> 01:02:06,297
- She was going through my purse.
- They're persecuted enough.

1039
01:02:06,375 --> 01:02:10,369
- Who's persecuting? She stole!
- So? We can afford it.

1040
01:02:10,445 --> 01:02:13,779
How can we afford it, on your
pay? What if she steals more?

1041
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:16,945
She's a colored woman from
Harlem. She has no money.

1042
01:02:17,021 --> 01:02:20,957
She has a right to steal from us.
Who can she steal from if not from us?

1043
01:02:21,025 --> 01:02:23,655
- You're both crazy.
- They can't hear you.

1044
01:02:23,729 --> 01:02:26,424
Leo, I married a fool!

1045
01:02:26,498 --> 01:02:28,329
What's that?

1046
01:02:28,401 --> 01:02:33,840
That's the welcome home party,
1945, for my cousin Herbie.

1047
01:02:36,577 --> 01:02:40,014
Look. That over
there is Joey Nichols.

1048
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,742
He was my father's friend. He was
always bothering me when I was a kid.

1049
01:02:42,817 --> 01:02:45,753
Joey Nichols. See? Nickels.

1050
01:02:45,822 --> 01:02:49,121
See? Nickels. You see? Nickels.

1051
01:02:49,192 --> 01:02:54,256
You can always remember my name.
Just think of Joey Five-Cents.

1052
01:02:54,332 --> 01:02:58,292
That's me. Joey Five-Cents.

1053
01:02:58,370 --> 01:02:59,961
What an asshole.

1054
01:03:00,038 --> 01:03:03,371
The one who killed me the most
was my mother's sister, Tessie.

1055
01:03:03,442 --> 01:03:06,105
I was always the sister
with good common sense...

1056
01:03:06,179 --> 01:03:08,841
but Tessie was always
the one with personality.

1057
01:03:08,915 --> 01:03:11,907
When she was younger, they
all wanted to marry Tessie.

1058
01:03:11,985 --> 01:03:14,784
Do you believe Tessie
had the personality?

1059
01:03:14,855 --> 01:03:18,724
- She's the life of the ghetto no doubt.
- She was once a great beauty.

1060
01:03:18,793 --> 01:03:21,695
Tessie, they say you were
the sister with personality.

1061
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:24,358
I was a great beauty!

1062
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:28,461
- How did this personality come about?
- I was very charming.

1063
01:03:28,539 --> 01:03:30,699
There were many men
interested in you?

1064
01:03:30,774 --> 01:03:34,575
I was quite a lively dancer.

1065
01:03:34,646 --> 01:03:36,614
It's very hard to believe.

1066
01:03:36,714 --> 01:03:41,948
I had a really good day. It was
a fine way to spend my birthday.

1067
01:03:42,021 --> 01:03:45,183
- Your birthday isn't until tomorrow.
- But it's real close.

1068
01:03:45,257 --> 01:03:47,589
But no presents until midnight.

1069
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:52,732
Happy birthday.

1070
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:55,928
What is this? Is this a
present? Are you kidding?

1071
01:03:56,003 --> 01:03:58,734
Yeah. Why don't you try it on?

1072
01:03:58,807 --> 01:04:03,336
- This is more like a present for you.
- It'll add ten years to our sex life.

1073
01:04:03,414 --> 01:04:05,313
Yeah. Forget it.

1074
01:04:05,381 --> 01:04:08,077
Here's a real present.

1075
01:04:08,151 --> 01:04:11,145
- What is this anyway?
- Check it out.

1076
01:04:15,526 --> 01:04:19,520
You knew I wanted this.
God, it's terrific!

1077
01:04:19,597 --> 01:04:22,999
Just put on the watch and
that thing. It'll be perfect.

1078
01:04:33,733 --> 01:04:37,670
Seems like

1079
01:04:37,739 --> 01:04:42,368
Old times

1080
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:47,237
Having you

1081
01:04:47,317 --> 01:04:50,048
To walk with

1082
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:53,213
Seems like

1083
01:04:56,729 --> 01:05:01,028
Old times

1084
01:05:02,567 --> 01:05:06,868
Having you to walk with

1085
01:05:08,407 --> 01:05:13,710
And it's still a thrill

1086
01:05:13,781 --> 01:05:19,084
Just to have my arms

1087
01:05:19,154 --> 01:05:21,622
Around you

1088
01:05:24,793 --> 01:05:28,890
Still the thrill

1089
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:32,959
That it was the day

1090
01:05:33,038 --> 01:05:36,529
I found you

1091
01:05:36,609 --> 01:05:42,240
Seems like

1092
01:05:42,314 --> 01:05:46,810
Old times

1093
01:05:50,024 --> 01:05:55,257
Dinner dates and flowers

1094
01:05:57,732 --> 01:06:03,104
Old times

1095
01:06:04,608 --> 01:06:09,944
Staying up all hours

1096
01:06:10,013 --> 01:06:15,248
Making dreams come true

1097
01:06:16,621 --> 01:06:21,458
Doing things we used

1098
01:06:22,662 --> 01:06:26,063
To do

1099
01:06:28,001 --> 01:06:31,233
Seems like

1100
01:06:31,305 --> 01:06:34,936
Old times

1101
01:06:39,181 --> 01:06:44,280
Here with

1102
01:06:46,224 --> 01:06:50,718
You

1103
01:06:57,404 --> 01:06:59,371
Thank you.

1104
01:06:59,472 --> 01:07:01,667
You were sensational.

1105
01:07:01,741 --> 01:07:05,143
I told you if you stuck to
it, you would be great and-

1106
01:07:05,212 --> 01:07:07,341
You were sensational.

1107
01:07:07,448 --> 01:07:10,781
Yeah, they were a
terrific audience.

1108
01:07:10,852 --> 01:07:14,449
It makes it easy for
me, because I can be-

1109
01:07:14,524 --> 01:07:17,960
Excuse me. Hi, I'm Tony Lacey.

1110
01:07:18,028 --> 01:07:22,828
- We wanted to say we enjoyed your set.
- Yeah? Really?

1111
01:07:22,899 --> 01:07:25,892
I thought it was very
musical. I liked it a lot.

1112
01:07:25,971 --> 01:07:28,097
That's really nice. Thanks a lot.

1113
01:07:28,173 --> 01:07:32,201
Are you recording?
Are you with any label?

1114
01:07:32,277 --> 01:07:35,542
Me? No, not at all.

1115
01:07:35,615 --> 01:07:39,848
I'd like to talk to you about
that sometime if you get a chance.

1116
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:43,219
Possibly working together.

1117
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:47,956
That's nice. This is Alvy
Singer. Do you know Alvy?

1118
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:52,228
I don't, but I know your
work. I'm a big fan of yours.

1119
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:56,499
This is Shawn, Bob and Petronia.

1120
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:02,111
We're going back to the Pierre...

1121
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:05,240
and we're going to meet Jack
and Angelica for a drink.

1122
01:08:05,316 --> 01:08:08,480
If you'd like to come,
we'd love to have you.

1123
01:08:08,555 --> 01:08:12,183
We can sit and
talk. Not a big deal.

1124
01:08:12,257 --> 01:08:15,159
Just relax, be very mellow.

1125
01:08:15,228 --> 01:08:17,389
Remember we had that thing?

1126
01:08:17,465 --> 01:08:19,024
What thing?

1127
01:08:20,268 --> 01:08:22,668
Remember we discussed that thing?

1128
01:08:25,474 --> 01:08:30,105
Oh, the thing! Oh,
the thing. Yeah.

1129
01:08:30,179 --> 01:08:34,548
Well, if it's inconvenient,
that's fine, too.

1130
01:08:34,618 --> 01:08:39,248
We'll do it another time. If you're
on the coast, we'll get together there.

1131
01:08:39,323 --> 01:08:41,919
It was a wonderful set.
I really enjoyed it.

1132
01:08:41,994 --> 01:08:44,326
Nice to have met you. Good night.

1133
01:08:50,402 --> 01:08:53,372
What's the matter? You
want to go to that party?

1134
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:56,103
I don't know. I
thought it might be fun.

1135
01:08:56,176 --> 01:08:58,373
It would be nice to
meet some new people.

1136
01:08:59,814 --> 01:09:04,515
I don't think I could take a mellow
evening. I don't respond well to mellow.

1137
01:09:04,587 --> 01:09:08,250
If I get too mellow,
I ripen and rot.

1138
01:09:08,324 --> 01:09:11,691
- It's not good
for my- - All right.

1139
01:09:11,762 --> 01:09:14,322
You don't want to go to the
party. What do you want to do?

1140
01:09:22,275 --> 01:09:25,871
That day in Brooklyn was the last
day I remember having a good time.

1141
01:09:25,946 --> 01:09:29,780
- We never have any laughs anymore.
- I've been moody and dissatisfied.

1142
01:09:29,849 --> 01:09:32,910
- How often do you sleep together?
- Do you have sex often?

1143
01:09:32,986 --> 01:09:35,319
Hardly ever. Maybe
three times a week.

1144
01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:39,623
Constantly. I'd say three times a week.
Like the other night, Alvy wanted sex.

1145
01:09:39,695 --> 01:09:41,686
She would not sleep
with me the other night.

1146
01:09:41,763 --> 01:09:46,135
I don't know. Six months ago I would
have done it just to please him.

1147
01:09:46,202 --> 01:09:48,137
I tried everything.

1148
01:09:48,205 --> 01:09:51,697
I put on soft music
and my red light bulb.

1149
01:09:51,775 --> 01:09:57,079
Since our discussions here, I feel
I have a right to my own feelings.

1150
01:09:57,150 --> 01:10:00,516
I think you would have been happy,
because I really asserted myself.

1151
01:10:00,586 --> 01:10:03,054
The incredible thing is, I'm
paying for her analysis...

1152
01:10:03,121 --> 01:10:05,920
she's making progress,
and I'm getting screwed.

1153
01:10:05,992 --> 01:10:10,327
I feel so guilty, because
Alvy is paying for it.

1154
01:10:10,397 --> 01:10:12,695
So I feel guilty if I
don't sleep with him.

1155
01:10:12,766 --> 01:10:16,634
But if I do sleep with him, it's like
I'm going against my own feelings.

1156
01:10:16,704 --> 01:10:20,802
- I'm not making any progress.
- I can't win.

1157
01:10:20,876 --> 01:10:23,037
Sometimes I think I
should live with a woman.

1158
01:10:23,179 --> 01:10:27,412
I don't believe it. You
guys have never snorted coke?

1159
01:10:27,484 --> 01:10:31,682
I always wanted to try,
but Alvy's very down on it.

1160
01:10:31,755 --> 01:10:35,385
Don't put it on me. I don't want to
put a wad of white powder in my nose.

1161
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:37,395
There's the nasal membrane.

1162
01:10:37,463 --> 01:10:41,059
- You never want to try anything new.
- How can you say that?

1163
01:10:41,134 --> 01:10:45,935
I said you, I and that girl from
acting class should sleep together.

1164
01:10:46,006 --> 01:10:48,975
- That's sick.
- I know it's sick, but it's new.

1165
01:10:49,043 --> 01:10:51,740
- You didn't say it couldn't be sick.
- Come on, Alvy.

1166
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:55,610
- Do your body a favor. Try it.
- It'll be fun.

1167
01:10:55,683 --> 01:11:00,054
I'm sure it's fun, 'cause the Incas
did it. They were a million laughs.

1168
01:11:00,123 --> 01:11:02,524
For your own experience.
You want to write. Why not?

1169
01:11:02,593 --> 01:11:06,587
It's great stuff, Alvy. A friend
just brought it in from California.

1170
01:11:06,665 --> 01:11:09,929
I didn't tell you. We're
going to California next week.

1171
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,095
It's really a
thrill, as you know.

1172
01:11:13,172 --> 01:11:17,575
On my agent's advice, I sold out
and am going to do a TV appearance.

1173
01:11:17,643 --> 01:11:20,111
That's not it at all.
Alvy's giving an award on TV.

1174
01:11:20,179 --> 01:11:22,614
You act like you're
violating a moral issue.

1175
01:11:22,683 --> 01:11:26,814
It's so phony. We have to leave New
York during Christmas. It kills me.

1176
01:11:26,887 --> 01:11:32,485
Listen, while you're in California,
could you score some coke for me?

1177
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:37,692
Sure, be glad to. I'll just put
it in the hollow heel on my boot.

1178
01:11:37,766 --> 01:11:42,261
- How much is this stuff?
- About $2,000 an ounce.

1179
01:11:42,339 --> 01:11:44,900
Really? And what
is the kick of it?

1180
01:11:55,921 --> 01:11:59,824
I've never been so relaxed as I
have been since I moved out here.

1181
01:11:59,892 --> 01:12:03,886
I want you to see my house.
I live next to Hugh Hefner.

1182
01:12:03,964 --> 01:12:08,130
And the women are like in Playboy,
but they can move their arms and legs.

1183
01:12:08,204 --> 01:12:11,867
I can't get over that this
is really Beverly Hills.

1184
01:12:11,941 --> 01:12:14,967
The architecture is really consistent.
There's French next to Spanish...

1185
01:12:15,044 --> 01:12:17,605
next to Tudor next to Japanese.

1186
01:12:17,681 --> 01:12:19,616
It's so clean out here.

1187
01:12:19,684 --> 01:12:23,450
Because they don't throw garbage
away. They make it into TV shows.

1188
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:28,084
- Give us a break. It's Christmas.
- Can you believe this is Christmas?

1189
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:31,823
It was snowing and
really gray in New York.

1190
01:12:31,898 --> 01:12:34,526
Nice. Santa Claus
will have sun stroke.

1191
01:12:34,601 --> 01:12:37,934
Max, there's no crime,
there's no mugging.

1192
01:12:37,971 --> 01:12:40,099
There's no economic crime...

1193
01:12:40,174 --> 01:12:43,338
but there's ritual,
religious cult murders.

1194
01:12:43,412 --> 01:12:45,437
There's wheat-germ
killers out here.

1195
01:12:45,514 --> 01:12:48,142
While you're out here, I
want you to see my TV show.

1196
01:12:48,216 --> 01:12:50,742
And we're invited to
a big Christmas party.

1197
01:13:01,866 --> 01:13:05,359
Charlie, give me
a good laugh here.

1198
01:13:08,307 --> 01:13:10,331
A little bigger.

1199
01:13:10,408 --> 01:13:13,038
Do you realize how
immoral this all is?

1200
01:13:13,113 --> 01:13:15,240
I've got a hit series.

1201
01:13:15,315 --> 01:13:17,306
But you're adding fake laughs.

1202
01:13:19,454 --> 01:13:22,391
Give me a tremendous laugh here.

1203
01:13:22,458 --> 01:13:24,551
We do the show live in
front of an audience.

1204
01:13:24,626 --> 01:13:26,856
But nobody laughs, because
the jokes aren't funny.

1205
01:13:26,929 --> 01:13:29,489
That's why this
machine is dynamite.

1206
01:13:33,437 --> 01:13:36,702
Give me a medium chuckle here...

1207
01:13:36,774 --> 01:13:39,766
and then a big hand.

1208
01:13:39,844 --> 01:13:42,712
Is there booing on that?

1209
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:45,512
I don't feel well.

1210
01:13:45,585 --> 01:13:49,180
- What's the matter?
- I got very dizzy.

1211
01:13:49,255 --> 01:13:51,554
- I feel dizzy.
- Sit down.

1212
01:13:51,624 --> 01:13:53,057
Jesus.

1213
01:13:53,961 --> 01:13:56,931
You all right? You
want to lie down?

1214
01:13:56,998 --> 01:14:00,024
No. My stomach felt
queasy all morning.

1215
01:14:00,101 --> 01:14:02,195
How about a ginger ale?

1216
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:04,966
No. Maybe I'd better lie down.

1217
01:14:05,039 --> 01:14:08,808
Try to get some of this
down. It's just plain chicken.

1218
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:13,449
No, I can't eat
this. I'm nauseous.

1219
01:14:15,719 --> 01:14:19,451
If you could get me something to
get me through the next two hours.

1220
01:14:19,524 --> 01:14:23,393
I have to go to Burbank and
give out an award on a TV show.

1221
01:14:23,463 --> 01:14:26,125
There's nothing wrong with
you as far as I can tell.

1222
01:14:26,199 --> 01:14:29,396
You have no fever, no
symptoms of anything serious.

1223
01:14:29,469 --> 01:14:33,634
- You haven't eaten pork or shellfish.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry, Doctor.

1224
01:14:33,707 --> 01:14:37,702
Alvy, that was the show. Everything
is fine. They found a replacement.

1225
01:14:37,779 --> 01:14:39,940
They're going to
tape without you.

1226
01:14:40,016 --> 01:14:42,610
Jesus! Now I don't
get to do the TV show?

1227
01:14:44,254 --> 01:14:47,050
- I can't find any reason for this.
- Nothing at all?

1228
01:14:47,123 --> 01:14:51,152
- I could get a lab man up here.
- Hand me the salt, please.

1229
01:14:51,229 --> 01:14:55,290
Perhaps it would be better if
we took him to the hospital.

1230
01:14:55,367 --> 01:14:56,799
The hospital?

1231
01:14:56,868 --> 01:15:00,177
- There's no other way to diagnose him.
- This is not bad, actually.

1232
01:15:05,384 --> 01:15:08,717
Don't tell me we're going to have
to walk from the car to the house?

1233
01:15:08,787 --> 01:15:11,814
My feet haven't touched pavement
since I reached Los Angeles.

1234
01:15:11,891 --> 01:15:15,692
I'll take a meeting with you if
you'll take a meeting with Freddy.

1235
01:15:15,763 --> 01:15:17,993
I took a meeting with Freddy.
Freddy took a meeting with Charlie.

1236
01:15:18,065 --> 01:15:20,762
- You take a meeting with him.
- All the good meetings are taken.

1237
01:15:20,835 --> 01:15:22,770
Right now it's only a notion.

1238
01:15:22,837 --> 01:15:26,935
I think I can get money to make it into
a concept, then turn it into an idea.

1239
01:15:27,943 --> 01:15:29,740
Like this house, Max?

1240
01:15:29,812 --> 01:15:32,373
Even wrote a road map to
get us to the bathroom.

1241
01:15:32,449 --> 01:15:34,509
You should have told me
it was Tony Lacey's party.

1242
01:15:34,585 --> 01:15:36,280
What difference does that make?

1243
01:15:36,354 --> 01:15:38,289
I think he has a thing for Annie.

1244
01:15:38,356 --> 01:15:42,315
- No. He goes with that girl over there.
- Where?

1245
01:15:42,393 --> 01:15:45,420
- The one with the VPL.
- VPL?

1246
01:15:45,498 --> 01:15:48,524
Visible panty line.
She's gorgeous.

1247
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:51,798
She's a ten. That's great for you,
'cause you're used to two's, aren't you?

1248
01:15:51,871 --> 01:15:53,464
There are no two's.

1249
01:15:53,541 --> 01:15:56,169
You're used to the kind with shopping
bags walking through Central Park...

1250
01:15:56,243 --> 01:15:58,905
with the surgical
masks on, muttering.

1251
01:15:58,979 --> 01:16:01,813
How do you like this couple? They look
like they're from Masters and Johnson.

1252
01:16:01,883 --> 01:16:05,877
Intensive care ward. My God!

1253
01:16:05,956 --> 01:16:09,949
- I think she's giving me the eye.
- If she comes over, my brain will mush.

1254
01:16:11,295 --> 01:16:13,957
You're Alvy Singer, right?
Didn't we meet at EST?

1255
01:16:14,031 --> 01:16:15,897
No, I was never to EST.

1256
01:16:15,968 --> 01:16:19,061
- Then how can you criticize it?
- He didn't say anything.

1257
01:16:19,137 --> 01:16:23,370
I came to get some shock therapy,
but there was an energy crisis.

1258
01:16:23,442 --> 01:16:26,242
- He's my food taster. Have you two met?
- How do you do?

1259
01:16:26,314 --> 01:16:29,407
- Do you taste for poisoned food?
- Yeah, he's great.

1260
01:16:29,483 --> 01:16:31,883
You guys are wearing white.
It must be in the stars.

1261
01:16:31,952 --> 01:16:35,855
- Uri Geller must be on the premises.
- We're going to operate together.

1262
01:16:35,923 --> 01:16:40,918
In about six weeks we
could cut the whole album.

1263
01:16:40,997 --> 01:16:43,397
I don't know. This
is strange to me.

1264
01:16:43,466 --> 01:16:46,491
You can stay here. Use the
whole wing in this house.

1265
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:51,201
- Stay here?
- Really. Why are you smiling?

1266
01:16:51,276 --> 01:16:54,768
Not only is he a great agent,
but he really gives good leading.

1267
01:16:54,846 --> 01:16:59,306
This is a great house: saunas,
Jacuzzis, three tennis courts.

1268
01:16:59,384 --> 01:17:03,652
You know who the original owners
were? Nelson Eddy then Legs Diamond.

1269
01:17:03,724 --> 01:17:07,057
- Then you know who lived here?
- Trigger.

1270
01:17:07,127 --> 01:17:10,529
Charlie Chaplin, right
before his un-American thing.

1271
01:17:12,033 --> 01:17:16,232
- But you guys are still New Yorkers.
- Yeah, I love it there.

1272
01:17:16,305 --> 01:17:21,334
I used to live there for
years, but it's so dirty now.

1273
01:17:21,411 --> 01:17:25,677
- I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
- This is a nice screening room.

1274
01:17:25,749 --> 01:17:27,945
There's another
thing about New York.

1275
01:17:28,018 --> 01:17:30,180
If you want to see a movie,
you have to stand on line.

1276
01:17:30,254 --> 01:17:32,621
It could be freezing
or raining. And here-

1277
01:17:32,691 --> 01:17:35,182
We saw Grand lllusion
here last night.

1278
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:38,229
That's a great film if you're
high. It's really funny.

1279
01:17:38,297 --> 01:17:41,562
Come and see our bedroom. We
did a fantastic thing up there.

1280
01:17:41,634 --> 01:17:43,728
I'm cool.

1281
01:17:43,804 --> 01:17:46,773
It's wonderful. They eat
and watch movies all day.

1282
01:17:46,841 --> 01:17:51,334
And gradually you get old and die. It's
important to make an effort sometimes.

1283
01:17:51,413 --> 01:17:53,745
- Do you think his girlfriend's pretty?
- She's great looking.

1284
01:17:53,816 --> 01:17:57,183
A little on the androgynous side.

1285
01:17:57,253 --> 01:17:59,187
I forgot my mantra.

1286
01:18:17,877 --> 01:18:20,141
That was fun.

1287
01:18:20,213 --> 01:18:23,342
I don't think
California is bad at all.

1288
01:18:23,416 --> 01:18:25,716
It's a drag coming home.

1289
01:18:25,787 --> 01:18:29,883
A lot of beautiful women.
It was fun to flirt.

1290
01:18:29,957 --> 01:18:32,086
I have to face facts.

1291
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:36,791
I adore Alvy, but our relationship
doesn't seem to work anymore.

1292
01:18:36,866 --> 01:18:40,598
I'll have the usual trouble
with Annie in bed tonight.

1293
01:18:40,671 --> 01:18:42,605
Why do I need this?

1294
01:18:42,673 --> 01:18:47,611
If only I had the nerve to break
up, but it would really hurt him.

1295
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:51,206
If only I didn't feel guilty
asking Annie to move out.

1296
01:18:51,282 --> 01:18:54,650
It'd probably wreck her,
but I should be honest.

1297
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:57,451
Alvy, let's face it.

1298
01:18:57,524 --> 01:19:01,255
I don't think our
relationship is working.

1299
01:19:01,328 --> 01:19:04,355
I know. A relationship
is like a shark:

1300
01:19:04,432 --> 01:19:07,731
It has to constantly
move forward or it dies.

1301
01:19:07,802 --> 01:19:11,762
And I think what we've got
on our hands is a dead shark.

1302
01:19:11,841 --> 01:19:14,605
- Whose Catcher in the Rye is this?
- If it has my name on it...

1303
01:19:14,678 --> 01:19:16,838
I guess it's mine.

1304
01:19:16,912 --> 01:19:22,682
You wrote your name in all my books,
'cause you knew this day would come.

1305
01:19:22,753 --> 01:19:26,212
You wanted to break up
just as much as I do.

1306
01:19:26,290 --> 01:19:30,227
No question. I think we're
doing the mature thing.

1307
01:19:30,296 --> 01:19:33,629
Look. All the books on
death and dying are yours.

1308
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:36,135
And all the poetry
books are mine.

1309
01:19:36,203 --> 01:19:39,604
Denial of Death. This is
the first book I got you.

1310
01:19:39,673 --> 01:19:41,607
Remember that day?

1311
01:19:41,675 --> 01:19:44,270
I feel like there's a
great weight off my back.

1312
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:47,948
Thanks, honey.

1313
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:53,388
I mean, no. I think it's important
for us to explore new relationships.

1314
01:19:53,457 --> 01:19:58,555
There's no question about that, because
we've given this a more than fair shot.

1315
01:19:58,629 --> 01:20:00,824
My analyst thinks this
move is key for me.

1316
01:20:00,898 --> 01:20:05,268
And I trust her, because
my analyst recommended her.

1317
01:20:05,336 --> 01:20:08,431
Why should I put you through
all my moods and hang-ups anyway?

1318
01:20:08,508 --> 01:20:12,035
You know what the beauty part is? We
can always come back together again.

1319
01:20:12,112 --> 01:20:14,273
- There's no problem.
- Exactly.

1320
01:20:14,347 --> 01:20:18,979
I don't think many couples could handle
this, break up and remain friends.

1321
01:20:19,054 --> 01:20:21,749
This button is mine. Remember?

1322
01:20:21,823 --> 01:20:25,554
These are yours. "Impeach
Eisenhower. " "Impeach Nixon. "

1323
01:20:25,627 --> 01:20:29,257
"Impeach Lyndon Johnson.
" "Impeach Ronald Reagan. "

1324
01:20:30,733 --> 01:20:34,225
I miss Annie. I made
a terrible mistake.

1325
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:37,331
She's living in Los
Angeles with Tony Lacey.

1326
01:20:37,408 --> 01:20:40,969
If she is, then the hell with her. If
she likes that lifestyle, let her stay.

1327
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:43,913
- He's a jerk for one thing.
- He graduated Harvard.

1328
01:20:43,983 --> 01:20:47,886
Harvard makes mistakes,
too. Kissinger taught there.

1329
01:20:48,855 --> 01:20:51,255
Don't tell me you're jealous?

1330
01:20:51,324 --> 01:20:53,451
Yeah. Jealous? A
little bit. Like Medea.

1331
01:20:53,527 --> 01:20:57,191
Can I show you something? I
found this in the apartment.

1332
01:20:57,265 --> 01:21:02,067
Black soap. She used to wash her
face 800 times a day with black soap.

1333
01:21:02,137 --> 01:21:04,129
Don't ask me why.

1334
01:21:04,206 --> 01:21:06,732
Why don't you go
out with other women?

1335
01:21:06,810 --> 01:21:10,076
I tried, but it's
very depressing.

1336
01:21:10,147 --> 01:21:13,083
This always happens to
me. Quick! Get a broom!

1337
01:21:13,151 --> 01:21:16,314
What are you making
such a big deal about?

1338
01:21:16,388 --> 01:21:19,084
They're only lobsters.

1339
01:21:19,157 --> 01:21:22,457
- You're adult. You can pick up lobsters.
- I'm not myself since I quit smoking.

1340
01:21:22,528 --> 01:21:25,793
- When did you quit?
- Sixteen years ago.

1341
01:21:25,864 --> 01:21:28,698
- What do you mean?
- Mean?

1342
01:21:29,837 --> 01:21:32,807
You stopped smoking 16 years
ago. Is that what you said?

1343
01:21:34,675 --> 01:21:37,009
I don't understand.

1344
01:21:37,079 --> 01:21:39,707
Are you joking or what?

1345
01:21:50,995 --> 01:21:53,191
Central Park's turning green.

1346
01:21:53,265 --> 01:21:58,134
I saw that lunatic we used to
see with the pinwheel hat...

1347
01:21:58,204 --> 01:22:00,604
and the roller-skates.

1348
01:22:00,673 --> 01:22:04,131
Listen, I want you
to come back here.

1349
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:07,611
Well, then I'm going to
come out there and get you.

1350
01:22:11,986 --> 01:22:14,285
What do you mean, where am
I? Where do you think I am?

1351
01:22:14,357 --> 01:22:18,555
I'm at the Los Angeles
airport. I flew in.

1352
01:22:18,628 --> 01:22:21,461
I flew in to see you.

1353
01:22:21,529 --> 01:22:24,762
Can we not debate this
on the telephone...

1354
01:22:24,835 --> 01:22:27,668
because I've got a temperature...

1355
01:22:27,739 --> 01:22:31,811
and I'm getting my chronic
Los Angeles nausea again.

1356
01:22:31,945 --> 01:22:34,380
Wherever you want to
meet. I don't care.

1357
01:22:34,448 --> 01:22:36,416
I'll drive in. I rented a car.

1358
01:22:37,585 --> 01:22:39,520
I'm driving.

1359
01:22:39,587 --> 01:22:42,523
What, is that such a
miracle? I'm driving myself.

1360
01:22:58,811 --> 01:23:01,678
I'm going to have
the alfalfa sprouts...

1361
01:23:01,747 --> 01:23:05,410
and a plate of mashed yeast.

1362
01:23:24,973 --> 01:23:26,635
You look pretty.

1363
01:23:26,709 --> 01:23:30,339
No, I just lost a little
weight, that's all.

1364
01:23:34,753 --> 01:23:37,620
Well, you look nice.

1365
01:23:37,689 --> 01:23:41,524
I think we should get married.

1366
01:23:41,594 --> 01:23:43,060
Come on.

1367
01:23:44,897 --> 01:23:49,357
Why, you want to live out here?
It's like living in Munchkinland.

1368
01:23:49,436 --> 01:23:53,203
What do you mean? It's
perfectly fine out here.

1369
01:23:53,274 --> 01:23:56,676
Tony's very nice.

1370
01:23:56,745 --> 01:23:59,941
I meet people, go to
parties and play tennis.

1371
01:24:00,014 --> 01:24:02,780
That's a very big step for me.

1372
01:24:02,853 --> 01:24:05,980
I'm able to enjoy people more.

1373
01:24:06,056 --> 01:24:09,049
You're not going to
come back to New York?

1374
01:24:09,127 --> 01:24:13,030
What's so great about New York? It's
a dying city. You read Death in Venice.

1375
01:24:13,099 --> 01:24:16,431
You didn't read Death in Venice
until I bought it for you.

1376
01:24:16,503 --> 01:24:19,903
That's right. You only gave me books
with the word "death" in the title.

1377
01:24:19,973 --> 01:24:22,339
Because it's an important issue.

1378
01:24:22,408 --> 01:24:25,401
You're incapable of
enjoying life. You know that?

1379
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:27,913
You're like New York City.
You're just this person.

1380
01:24:27,982 --> 01:24:30,576
You're like this
island unto yourself.

1381
01:24:30,651 --> 01:24:33,747
I can't enjoy anything
unless everybody is.

1382
01:24:33,823 --> 01:24:38,192
If one guy is starving someplace,
it puts a crimp in my evening.

1383
01:24:40,630 --> 01:24:42,564
Do you want to get married?

1384
01:24:44,668 --> 01:24:47,832
No. We're friends.

1385
01:24:47,906 --> 01:24:50,602
I want to remain friends.

1386
01:24:52,677 --> 01:24:54,110
Check please.

1387
01:24:54,180 --> 01:24:57,173
You're mad, aren't you?

1388
01:24:57,249 --> 01:25:00,117
Yes, of course I'm mad, because
you love me. I know that.

1389
01:25:00,187 --> 01:25:02,712
I can't say that that's true
at this point in my life.

1390
01:25:02,789 --> 01:25:05,520
I really can't say that's true.

1391
01:25:05,593 --> 01:25:08,495
You know how wonderful you are.

1392
01:25:08,563 --> 01:25:12,432
You're the reason I got out of my
room, that I was able to sing...

1393
01:25:12,501 --> 01:25:16,837
and get more in touch with
my feelings and all that crap.

1394
01:25:16,907 --> 01:25:19,307
Listen, listen.

1395
01:25:20,578 --> 01:25:22,307
So what are you up to?

1396
01:25:24,716 --> 01:25:28,652
The usual. I'm trying to
write. I'm working on a play.

1397
01:25:30,489 --> 01:25:33,083
Are you saying you're not
coming back to New York with me?

1398
01:25:34,393 --> 01:25:39,161
No. Look. I gotta go.

1399
01:25:39,233 --> 01:25:42,600
What do you mean? I flew
3,000 miles to see you.

1400
01:25:42,669 --> 01:25:45,434
Air miles. Do you know what
that does to my stomach?

1401
01:25:45,506 --> 01:25:47,498
If you must know, it's
a hectic time for Tony.

1402
01:25:47,574 --> 01:25:49,567
- The Grammys are tonight.
- The what?

1403
01:25:49,646 --> 01:25:51,772
The Grammys. He's got a lot
of records up for awards.

1404
01:25:51,848 --> 01:25:54,544
They give awards for that
music? I thought just ear plugs.

1405
01:25:54,618 --> 01:25:58,179
Just forget it. Let's just
forget the conversation.

1406
01:25:58,255 --> 01:26:01,350
They do nothing but give out
awards. I can't believe it.

1407
01:26:01,424 --> 01:26:04,623
Greatest Fascist
Dictator: Adolph Hitler.

1408
01:26:34,866 --> 01:26:37,733
I know what you're going to
say. I'm not a great driver.

1409
01:26:37,802 --> 01:26:40,964
- I have some problems with- -
May I see your license, please?

1410
01:26:41,038 --> 01:26:43,634
Just don't get angry.

1411
01:26:43,709 --> 01:26:47,577
I have my license
here. It's a rented car.

1412
01:26:49,549 --> 01:26:52,882
Don't give me your life's story.

1413
01:26:52,952 --> 01:26:55,217
Just pick up the license.

1414
01:26:55,289 --> 01:26:59,158
You have to ask nicely, because
I've had a rough day. My girlfriend-

1415
01:26:59,227 --> 01:27:01,695
Just give me the license, please.

1416
01:27:03,465 --> 01:27:06,263
Since you put it that way,
it's hard for me to refuse.

1417
01:27:06,337 --> 01:27:09,430
I have a terrific
problem with authority.

1418
01:27:09,505 --> 01:27:11,905
It's not your fault.
Don't take it personal.

1419
01:27:20,118 --> 01:27:22,679
So long, fellows. Keep in touch.

1420
01:27:32,199 --> 01:27:36,033
Imagine my surprise
when I got your call.

1421
01:27:36,103 --> 01:27:39,336
Yeah. I had the feeling
I got you at a bad moment.

1422
01:27:39,408 --> 01:27:41,706
I heard high-pitched squealing.

1423
01:27:41,777 --> 01:27:43,244
Twins, Max.

1424
01:27:44,146 --> 01:27:46,205
Sixteen-year-olds.

1425
01:27:47,717 --> 01:27:51,449
Can you imagine the mathematical
possibilities of that?

1426
01:27:51,522 --> 01:27:55,014
You're an actor. You should be
doing Shakespeare in the park.

1427
01:27:55,092 --> 01:27:58,426
I did Shakespeare in
the park. I got mugged.

1428
01:27:58,497 --> 01:28:01,899
I was playing Richard ll. Two guys
with leather jackets stole my leotard.

1429
01:28:07,473 --> 01:28:10,774
Are we driving through plutonium?

1430
01:28:10,845 --> 01:28:14,303
Keeps out the alpha
rays. You don't get old.

1431
01:28:16,584 --> 01:28:19,917
You're a thinking person. How
can you choose this lifestyle?

1432
01:28:19,988 --> 01:28:22,720
What is so great about New York?

1433
01:28:22,793 --> 01:28:25,990
It's a dying city. You
read Death in Venice.

1434
01:28:26,062 --> 01:28:28,462
You didn't read Death in
Venice until I gave it to you.

1435
01:28:28,532 --> 01:28:30,866
You only give me books with
the word "death" in the title.

1436
01:28:30,936 --> 01:28:34,839
- It's an important issue.
- You're incapable of enjoying life.

1437
01:28:34,906 --> 01:28:38,001
You're like New York.
You're an island.

1438
01:28:38,076 --> 01:28:41,706
Okay. If that's all that we've been
through together means to you...

1439
01:28:41,781 --> 01:28:45,444
it's better if we just said
good-bye, once and for all.

1440
01:28:45,519 --> 01:28:47,043
It's funny.

1441
01:28:47,121 --> 01:28:49,521
After all the serious talks
and passionate moments...

1442
01:28:49,591 --> 01:28:53,118
that it ends here, in a health
food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard.

1443
01:28:53,895 --> 01:28:56,295
Good-bye, Sally.

1444
01:28:56,364 --> 01:29:00,802
Wait. I'm going to go with you.

1445
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:02,838
I love you.

1446
01:29:06,244 --> 01:29:09,144
What do you want?
It was my first play.

1447
01:29:09,214 --> 01:29:12,275
You know how you're always trying to
get things to come out perfect in art...

1448
01:29:12,350 --> 01:29:15,582
because it's real
difficult in life.

1449
01:29:15,654 --> 01:29:20,216
Interestingly, however, I
did run into Annie again.

1450
01:29:20,292 --> 01:29:22,352
It was on the Upper
West Side of Manhattan.

1451
01:29:22,430 --> 01:29:26,161
She had moved back to New York. She
was living in Soho with some guy.

1452
01:29:26,234 --> 01:29:30,330
When I met her, she was dragging him
in to see The Sorrow and the Pity...

1453
01:29:30,405 --> 01:29:32,999
which I counted as
a personal triumph.

1454
01:29:33,074 --> 01:29:35,839
Annie and I had lunch
sometime after that...

1455
01:29:35,911 --> 01:29:39,940
and just kicked around old times.

1456
01:29:40,017 --> 01:29:44,146
Just to have my arms

1457
01:29:46,223 --> 01:29:48,249
Around you

1458
01:29:51,897 --> 01:29:55,424
Still the thrill

1459
01:29:56,035 --> 01:29:59,301
That it was the day

1460
01:29:59,373 --> 01:30:01,672
I found you

1461
01:30:02,577 --> 01:30:05,841
Seems like

1462
01:30:08,082 --> 01:30:12,851
Old times

1463
01:30:15,458 --> 01:30:20,862
Dinner dates and flowers

1464
01:30:23,701 --> 01:30:25,726
Old times

1465
01:30:27,172 --> 01:30:30,039
After that, it got late
and we both had to go.

1466
01:30:30,109 --> 01:30:32,304
But it was great
seeing Annie again.

1467
01:30:32,378 --> 01:30:35,108
I realize what a
terrific person she was...

1468
01:30:35,181 --> 01:30:38,049
and how much fun it
was just knowing her.

1469
01:30:38,118 --> 01:30:41,782
And I thought of that old joke.

1470
01:30:41,856 --> 01:30:46,692
This guy goes to a psychiatrist
and says, "Doc, my brother's crazy.

1471
01:30:46,762 --> 01:30:49,356
He thinks he's a chicken. "

1472
01:30:49,432 --> 01:30:51,731
The doctor says, "Why
don't you turn him in?"

1473
01:30:51,802 --> 01:30:54,862
The guy says, "I would,
but I need the eggs. "

1474
01:30:54,938 --> 01:30:59,500
Well, I guess that's, now,
how I feel about relationships.

1475
01:30:59,576 --> 01:31:04,607
They're totally irrational,
crazy and absurd.

1476
01:31:04,682 --> 01:31:07,675
But I guess we keep
going through it...

1477
01:31:07,753 --> 01:31:10,949
because most of us need the eggs.
