1
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,050
Let me tell you what
"Like A Virgin" is about.

2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,450
It's all about a girl
who digs a guy with a big dick.

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,650
The entire song
is a metaphor for big dicks.

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,150
No, it ain't.

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,450
It's about a girl
who's very vulnerable.

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,750
She's been fucked over a few times
and she meets a guy who's sensitive.

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,150
Whoa. Timeout.
Tell that bullshit to the tourists.

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,450
Toby? Who the fuck is Toby?

9
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:33,050
"Like A Virgin" is not about some
sensitive girl who meets a nice fella.

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,750
That's what "True Blue" is about.
No argument about that.

11
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,750
- Which one is "True Blue"?
- It was a big-ass hit for Madonna.

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,250
I don't even follow that top-of-the-pops
shit, and I've heard of "True Blue."

13
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,050
I didn't say I ain't heard of it.
All I asked is, how's it go?

14
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,550
Excuse me for not being
the world's biggest Madonna fan.

15
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,050
Personally, I can do without her.

16
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,250
I used to like her early stuff,
"Borderline"...

17
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,250
but once she got off with that
"Papa, Don't Preach" phase, I tuned out.

18
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,150
Hey, you guys are making me
lose my train of thought here.

19
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,350
I was sayin' something.
What was it?

20
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,750
Oh, Toby's that
little Chinese girl.

21
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,450
- What was her last name?
- What's that?

22
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:12,050
It's an old address book I found in
a coat I haven't worn in a coon's age.

23
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,150
- What was that name?
- What the fuck was I talkin' about?

24
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,450
You said "True Blue"
was about a guy--

25
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,850
a sensitive girl
who meets a nice guy...

26
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,450
but "Like A Virgin"
was a metaphor for big dicks.

27
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,850
Let me tell you what
"Like A Virgin" is about.

28
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,850
It's all about this cooze
who's a regular fuck machine.

29
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,250
I'm talkin' morning, day,
night, afternoon...

30
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,250
dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick, dick!

31
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,450
- How many "dicks" is that?
- A lot.

32
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,850
Then one day, she meets
this John Holmes motherfucker.

33
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,550
It's like, "Whoa, baby." He's like
Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape."

34
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,150
He's diggin' tunnels.
Now she's gettin' serious dick action.

35
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,650
She's feelin' somethin' she ain't
felt since forever: pain, pain.

36
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,350
Chew? Toby Chew?

37
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,650
It hurts. It hurts her.

38
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,250
It shouldn't hurt her.
Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now.

39
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,950
But when this cat
fucks her, it hurts.

40
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,150
It hurts just like it did
the first time.

41
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,850
You see, the pain
is reminding a fuck machine...

42
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,050
what it was once like
to be a virgin.

43
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,950
Hence, "Like A Virgin."

44
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,650
Wong.

45
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,850
-Give me that fuckin' thing.
-What in hell do you think you're doin'?

46
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,050
I'm sick of hearin' it, Joe.
I'll give it back to you when we leave.

47
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,650
What do you mean, when we leave?
Give me it back now!

48
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,650
For the past 15 minutes now,
you've been droning on about names.

49
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,650
"Toby. Toby?

50
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,950
Toby? Toby Wong.

51
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,150
Toby Wong? Toby Wong.

52
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,150
Toby Chung fuckin' Charlie Chan."

53
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,750
I've got Madonna's big dick
comin' out of my left ear...

54
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:44,750
and Toby the Jap-- I don't know what--
comin' out of my right.

55
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,350
Give me that book.

56
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,350
Are you gonna put it away?

57
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,950
I'm gonna do whatever
the fuck I want with it.

58
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,450
Well, then I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to keep it.

59
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,450
Hey, Joe,
want me to shoot this guy?

60
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,450
Shit.

61
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,550
You shoot me in a dream,
you better wake up and apologize.

62
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,650
You guys been listenin' to K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s" weekend?

63
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,650
Yeah. That's fuckin' great.

64
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,550
- You believe the songs they're playin'?
- Know what I heard the other day?

65
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,550
"Heartbeat, It's a Lovebeat" by little
Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco family.

66
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,150
I haven't heard that song since
I was in the fifth fuckin' grade.

67
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,850
When I was comin' down here, "The Night
the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on.

68
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,850
I ain't heard that song
since it was big.

69
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,150
But when it was big, I must've heard it
a million-trillion fuckin' times.

70
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,150
But this is the first time
I ever realized...

71
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,050
that the girl singin' the song
is the one who shot Andy.

72
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,650
You didn't know that Vickie Lawrence
was the one who shot Andy?

73
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,650
- I thought the cheatin' wife shot Andy.
- They say that at the end of the song.

74
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,150
I know, motherfucker. I just heard it.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

75
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,650
I must've zoned out
during that part before.

76
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:50,750
All right,
I'll take care of the check.

77
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,450
All right,
I'll take care of the check.

78
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,950
You guys can get the tip.

79
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,350
Should be about a buck apiece.

80
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,650
And you, when I come back
I want my book.

81
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,150
Sorry. It's my book now.

82
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,250
Hey, I changed my mind.
Shoot this piece of shit, will ya?

83
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,350
All right, everybody cough up
some green for the little lady.

84
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,450
Come on, throw in a buck.

85
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,150
I don't tip.

86
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,950
- You don't tip?
- I don't believe in it.

87
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,150
You don't believe in tipping?

88
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,450
Do you know what these chicks make?
They make shit.

89
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,250
If she don't make enough money,
she can quit.

90
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,050
I don't even know a fuckin' Jew
who'd have the balls to say that.

91
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,850
Let me get this straight.
You don't ever tip, huh?

92
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,650
I don't tip because
society says I have to.

93
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,150
If they really put forth the effort,
I'll give 'em somethin' extra.

94
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,750
But this tipping automatically,
it's for the birds.

95
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,550
As far as I'm concerned,
they're just doin' their job.

96
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,550
- This girl was nice.
- She was okay.

97
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,850
- She wasn't anything special.
- What's special?

98
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,550
Take you in the back
and suck your dick?

99
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,150
I'd go over 12% for that.

100
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,150
I ordered coffee, all right?
She's only filled my cup three times.

101
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,150
I want it filled six times.

102
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,450
Six times? Well, what if
she's too fuckin' busy?

103
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,650
The words "too fuckin' busy"
shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary.

104
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,450
Excuse me, Mr. Pink,
but the last fuckin' thing you need's...

105
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,950
another cup of coffee.

106
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:31,350
These ladies aren't starvin' to death.
They make minimum wage.

107
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,550
I used to work minimum wage,
and when I did...

108
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,550
I wasn't lucky enough to have a job
that society deemed tip-worthy.

109
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,650
You don't care they're
countin' on your tips to live?

110
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,150
You know what this is?

111
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,950
The world's smallest violin,
playin' just for the waitresses.

112
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,450
You don't have any idea
what you're talkin' about.

113
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,850
These people bust their ass.
This is a hard job.

114
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,250
So's working at McDonald's,
but you don't feel the need to tip them.

115
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,850
They're servin' you food,
but society says...

116
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,750
"Don't tip these guys over here,
but tip these guys." That's bullshit.

117
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,950
Waitressing is
the number-one occupation...

118
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,750
for female non-college graduates
in this country.

119
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,750
It's the one job basically
any woman can get and make a living on.

120
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,850
The reason is
because of their tips.

121
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,550
Fuck all that.

122
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,050
I'm very sorry the government
taxes their tips.

123
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,350
That's fucked up.
That ain't my fault.

124
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,550
It would appear that waitresses
are one of the many groups...

125
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,850
the government fucks in the ass
on a regular basis.

126
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,450
Show me a paper that says the government
shouldn't do that, I'll sign it.

127
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,150
I'll vote for it.
But what I won't do is play ball.

128
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,150
This non-college bullshit, I got two
words for that: Learn to fuckin' type.

129
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,650
If you're expectin' me to help out with
the rent, you're in for a big surprise.

130
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,650
He's convinced me.
Give me my dollar back.

131
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:48,050
Hey. Leave the dollars there.

132
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,650
All right, ramblers,
let's get ramblin'.

133
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,450
Wait a minute.
Who didn't throw in?

134
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,250
- Mr. Pink.
- Mr. Pink?

135
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,950
- Why not?
- He don't tip.

136
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,950
He don't tip?

137
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,950
- You don't tip?
- He don't believe in it.

138
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,350
Shut up. What do you mean,
you don't believe in it?

139
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:13,050
Cough up a buck, you cheap bastard.
I paid for your goddamn breakfast.

140
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:17,050
Since you bought breakfast, I'll put in.
But normally I would never do this.

141
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,450
Never mind what you
normally would do.

142
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,950
Just cough in your goddamn buck
like everybody else. Thank you.

143
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:32,250
That was the Partridge Family's
"Doesn't Somebody Want To Be Wanted?"...

144
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,350
followed by Edison Lighthouse's...

145
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,550
"Love Grows Where
My Rosemary Goes"...

146
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,250
as K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s" weekend...

147
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,950
just keeps on truckin'.

148
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,450
just keeps on truckin'.

150
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,450
I'm gonna die.

151
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,450
I'm gonna die!

152
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,450
Just hold on, buddy boy!

153
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,150
I'm gonna die!

154
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,550
- I'm sorry!
- Give me your hand.

155
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:46,850
I can't believe she killed me, man!
Who'd have fuckin' thought that?

156
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,550
Hey, just cancel
that shit right now!

157
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,450
You're hurt. You're hurt
real fuckin' bad, but you ain't dying!

158
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,850
All this blood's scarin'
the shit out of me, Larry!

159
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,350
I'm gonna die!
I know it!

160
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,550
Excuse me, I didn't realize
you had a degree in medicine.

161
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,750
Are you a doctor?

162
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,650
Are you a doctor?

163
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,250
Answer me, please!
Are you a doctor?

164
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,950
No, I'm not.
I'm not.

165
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,050
So you admit you don't know
what you're talkin' about.

166
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:31,750
If you're through givin' me your
amateur opinion, lie back and listen.

167
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,250
I'm takin' you back to the rendezvous,
Joe's gonna get you a doctor...

168
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,050
the doctor's gonna
fix you up and...

169
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,350
you're gonna be okay.

170
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,850
Now say it!
You're gonna be okay!

171
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,350
Say it!

172
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,250
You're gonna be okay!

173
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,450
Say the goddamn words!
You're gonna be okay!

174
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,950
Oh, God!

175
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,050
Say the goddamn fuckin' words!

176
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,750
Say it!

177
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,950
Okay, Larry.

178
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,950
Correct! Correct!

179
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,650
I'm okay.

180
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,950
Look where we are.

181
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,650
Look where we are.

182
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,550
She had a baby, man.
She had a baby!

183
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,550
We're in a warehouse.

184
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,950
Who's a tough guy?
Who's a tough guy?

185
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,850
Come on, who's a tough guy?

186
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,750
Who's a tough guy?
You're a tough guy.

187
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,750
You're a fuckin' tough guy.

188
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,950
We're in a warehouse.
Look where we are.

189
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,350
We made it. We made it.

190
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,750
We fuckin' made it.
We have fuckin' made it.

191
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,850
We're in a warehouse.
Look where we are.

192
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,250
Look where we are.

193
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,050
Hold on. Hold on.

194
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,850
- Shit!
- Stop bangin' your head.

195
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,350
You're gonna bang
a fuckin' hole in the floor.

196
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,150
You don't wanna hurt
the fuckin' floor, do you?

197
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,450
I can't do anything for you.

198
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,950
But when Joe gets here...

199
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,050
which should be any time now...

200
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:27,250
he's gonna help you out,
he's gonna take care of you.

201
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,750
We're gonna sit
and wait for Joe.

202
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,250
- Who are we waitin' for?
- Joe.

203
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:43,750
Larry, I'm fucking scared, man.

204
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,550
Would you please hold me?

205
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,350
Yeah, sure.

206
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,050
You go ahead and be scared.

207
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,550
You've been brave enough
for one day.

208
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,850
I just want you
to relax now, okay?

209
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,350
You're not gonna fuckin' die.
You're gonna be fine.

210
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,850
When Joe gets here,
he'll make you 100% again.

211
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,050
Am I hurt?
I'm hurt bad, Larry.

212
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,150
It's not good, no.

213
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,650
Hey, Larry...

214
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,750
bless your heart
for what you're tryin' to do.

215
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,750
I was panicking
for a minute back there.

216
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,950
But I got my senses back now.

217
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:01,050
The situation is,
I'm shot in the belly.

218
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,350
Without medical attention,
I'm gonna die.

219
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,350
- I can't take you to a hospital.
- Fuck jail, man!

220
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:16,050
You don't have to take me in.
Just drive me up to the front, man.

221
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,850
Just drop me on the sidewalk.
I'll take care of myself.

222
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:26,650
I won't tell 'em anything, man.
I won't tell 'em anything.

223
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,350
I swear to fucking God, man.

224
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:34,650
Just look in my eyes, Larry.
Look in my eyes.

225
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:40,450
I won't tell them anything.

226
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,450
You'll be safe, man.

227
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,850
You're not gonna fuckin' die, kid.
All right?

228
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,050
Listen to me.
You're gonna be fine.

229
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,550
Along with the kneecap...

230
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,150
the gut is the most painful area
a guy can get shot in.

231
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,350
No shit!

232
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,250
But it takes a long time
to die from it.

233
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,750
I'm talkin' days.

234
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,950
You're gonna wish you were dead, but
it takes days to die from your wound.

235
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,850
Time is on your side.

236
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,150
Was that a fucking setup, or what?

237
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,750
Shit. Orange got tagged?

238
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,550
Gut shot.

239
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,950
Fuck. Where's Brown?

240
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,350
Dead.

241
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,850
How did he die?

242
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,150
How the fuck do you think?
The cops shot him.

243
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,350
This is bad.

244
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:35,150
This is so fucking bad.
Is it bad?

245
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,850
As opposed to good?

246
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,150
Man, this is fucked up.

247
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,550
This is so fucked up.

248
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,550
Somebody fucked us up
big time, man.

249
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:52,250
- You really think we were set up?
- Do you even doubt it, man?

250
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,750
I don't think we got set up, I know it.
Where did all those cops come from, huh?

251
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,250
One minute they're not there,
and the next minute they're there.

252
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,550
I didn't hear any sirens.
The alarm went off, okay?

253
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,150
When an alarm goes, you got
a four-minute response time.

254
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,850
Unless a patrol car is cruising
that street at that moment...

255
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,550
you got four minutes before
they can realistically respond.

256
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,550
In one minute, there were
17 blue boys out there...

257
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:17,050
all knowing exactly what the fuck they
were doing, and they were all there!

258
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,950
Remember that second wave
that showed up in the cars?

259
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,650
Those were the ones responding to the
alarm, but those first motherfuckers...

260
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,150
they were there
and they were waitin' for us.

261
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,750
Haven't you fuckin'
thought about this?

262
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,550
I haven't had a chance to think.

263
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,950
First I was just tryin'
to get the fuck outta there.

264
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:38,050
And after we got away,
I've just been dealin' with him.

265
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,450
Better start thinkin' about it,
'cause that's all I'm thinkin' about.

266
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,450
I wasn't even gonna come here.
I was just gonna drive off, man...

267
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,050
because whoever set us up
knows about this place.

268
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,950
There could've been cops here waitin'!
There could be cops comin' right now!

269
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,950
Let's go in the other room.
Hey. In there.

270
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,550
Larry, don't leave me.

271
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:07,550
I'll be right in the other room, okay?
I'll be right there lookin' at ya.

272
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,250
I'm right here
lookin' at you, okay?

273
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,850
I'm right over there.

274
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,950
Larry...

275
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,250
I'm gonna fucking die.

276
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,150
Larry.

277
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,550
What the fuck
am I doin' here, man?

278
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,750
I felt funny about
this job right off.

279
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:33,550
As soon as I felt it I should have said,
"No, thank you," but I never listen.

280
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,950
Every time I ever got fucked
buying weed, the same thing.

281
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,650
I didn't trust the guy,
but I wanted to believe him.

282
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,650
If he's not lying and it really
is Thai stick, then it's great.

283
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,150
But it never is, and I always said that
if I felt that about a job, I'd walk.

284
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,350
And I didn't. I didn't
because of the fuckin' money!

285
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:51,150
What's done is done.
I need you cool.

286
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,150
Are you cool?

287
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,950
I'm cool.

288
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,950
Splash some water on your face.

289
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,650
Take a breather.

290
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,150
Relax. Have a cigarette.

291
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,250
I quit.

292
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,050
- All right.
- Why, you got one?

293
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,450
Okay, let's go through
what happened.

294
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,050
We're in the place,
everything's going fine.

295
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,250
Then the alarm gets tripped.

296
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,750
I turn around
and all these cops are outside.

297
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:20,250
You're right. It was like, bam,
I blinked my eyes and they're there.

298
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:24,650
Everybody starts going ape-shit.
Then Mr. Blonde starts to shoot all--

299
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,750
- That's not correct.
- What's wrong with it?

300
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,550
Okay. The cops did not show up
after the alarm went off.

301
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:35,150
The cops didn't show up until after
Mr. Blonde started shootin' everybody.

302
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,350
- Soon as I heard the alarm, I saw cops.
- It wasn't that soon.

303
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:42,350
They didn't let their presence be known
until after Mr. Blonde became a madman.

304
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,350
I'm not sayin' they weren't there.
I'm sayin' they were there.

305
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:49,250
But they didn't make a move until after
Mr. Blonde started shootin' everybody.

306
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:52,350
I mean, that's how
I know we were set up.

307
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,750
- Mr. White, you can see that--
- Enough of this "Mr. White" shit.

308
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:59,450
Wait! Don't tell me you're fuckin' name!
I don't wanna know it!

309
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,150
Jesus Christ,
I ain't gonna tell you mine.

310
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,750
You're right.
This is bad.

311
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:18,650
- How did you get out?
- I shot my way out.

312
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,150
Everybody started shootin',
so I blasted my way out of there.

313
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:29,250
Move it! Get outta the way!
Get the fuck outta the way!

314
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,850
Get the fuck outta the way!

315
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,150
Move it!
Get outta the way!

316
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,950
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck is your problem, man?

317
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,250
- You fuckin' asshole!
- Fuck you!

318
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,350
Move!

319
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,950
Jesus!

320
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,450
Get outta the car!
Get the fuck outta the car!

321
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,750
Move it!
Move outta the way!

322
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,350
I tagged a couple of cops.

323
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,550
Did you kill anybody?

324
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:39,750
- A few cops.
- No real people?

325
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,750
Just cops.

326
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,150
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?

327
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,650
That was the most insane
fuckin' thing I have ever seen.

328
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,350
Why the fuck would Joe
hire a guy like that?

329
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,050
I don't want to kill anybody.

330
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,750
If I gotta get out that door
and you're standin' in my way...

331
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,250
one way or the other
you're gettin' outta my way.

332
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,650
That's the way I look at it.

333
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,350
The choice between
doin' ten years...

334
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:17,250
and takin' out
some stupid motherfucker...

335
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,350
ain't no choice at all.

336
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,050
But I ain't no madman, either.

337
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:26,850
What the fuck was Joe thinkin'?
You can't work with a guy like that.

338
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,750
We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't
tag us when he shot the place up.

339
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:36,750
I came this close
to takin' his ass out myself.

340
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,850
I mean, everybody panics.
Everybody.

341
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,650
Things get tense.
It's human nature.

342
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:46,450
You panic. I don't care what
your name is, you can't help it.

343
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:50,350
Fuck, man, you panic on the inside,
in your head, you know?

344
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:54,650
You give yourself a couple of seconds,
get ahold of it and deal with it.

345
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,750
What you don't do is start shootin' up
the place and start killin' people.

346
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:02,050
What you're supposed to do
is act like a fuckin' professional.

347
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:06,650
A psychopath ain't a professional.
You can't work with a psychopath.

348
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,350
You don't know what those
sick assholes are gonna do next.

349
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:15,650
I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you
think that black girl was? Twenty?

350
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:18,050
- Maybe 21?
- If that.

351
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,650
Did you see what happened
to anybody else?

352
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:27,450
Me and Orange jumped in the car,
Brown floored it.

353
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,650
After that,
I don't know what went down.

354
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,750
It was every man for himself.

355
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,750
As far as Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue are
concerned, I ain't got the foggiest...

356
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,950
'cause once I got out,
I never looked back.

357
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,050
What do you think?

358
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:42,450
What do I think? The cops either
caught 'em or killed 'em.

359
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,850
No chance they punched through?
You found a hole.

360
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:49,350
Yeah, and that was
a fuckin' miracle.

361
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:53,150
But even if they did get away,
then where the fuck are they?

362
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,550
You don't think it's possible one of 'em
got ahold of the diamonds and--

363
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:00,050
- No, no way.
- How can you be so sure?

364
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,950
I got the diamonds.

365
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,950
That's my boy.

366
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,750
- Where?
- I stashed 'em.

367
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:21,050
If you wanna come with me,
let's go get 'em right now, this second.

368
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:24,650
'Cause I think stayin' here, man, we
should have our fuckin' heads examined.

369
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,850
That was the plan.
We meet here.

370
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,850
Then where the fuck is everybody?

371
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:32,050
I say the plan becomes null and void
once we found out we got a rat here.

372
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:35,150
We ain't got the slightest idea
what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue.

373
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,650
They could both be dead
or maybe they're arrested.

374
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,650
The cops could have 'em right now
at the station, sweatin' 'em down.

375
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:44,250
They don't know our names, but they
could be singin' about this place.

376
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,950
I swear to God,
I think I'm fuckin' jinxed.

377
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,950
What?

378
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,850
Two jobs back,
it was a four-man job.

379
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,350
We discovered one of the team
was an undercover cop.

380
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,950
No shit?

381
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,550
Thank God we discovered in time.

382
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,750
We had to forget the whole thing,
just walk the fuck away from it.

383
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,050
So who's the rat this time?

384
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,050
Mr. Blue?

385
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,850
Mr. Brown?

386
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:27,150
Joe? Joe set this whole thing up.
Maybe he set it up to set it up.

387
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:30,650
I don't buy it.
Me and Joe go back a long time.

388
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:34,050
I can tell you definitely, Joe didn't
know a thing about this bullshit.

389
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:38,750
I know Joe, and me sayin' he definitely
had nothin' to do with it is ridiculous.

390
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:41,950
I can say I definitely didn't do it,
'cause I know what I did or didn't do.

391
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:45,550
But I cannot definitely say that about
anybody, 'cause I don't definitely know.

392
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,650
For all I know, you're the rat.

393
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,150
For all I know,
you're the fuckin' rat!

394
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,550
All right, now you're usin'
your fuckin' head.

395
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:55,050
For all we know, he's the rat.

396
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:58,450
That kid in there is dying
from a fuckin' bullet I saw him take...

397
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,650
so don't you be calling him a rat!

398
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:03,050
Look, I'm right, okay?

399
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,650
Somebody's a fuckin' rat.

400
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,950
Where's the commode in this dungeon?
I gotta take a squirt.

401
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,750
Go down the hall, make a left,
go up the stairs...

402
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,750
and make a right.

403
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:32,150
- By the way, how's Alabama?
- Alabama?

404
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,850
I haven't seen Bama
in over a year and a half.

405
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:38,350
But I thought you two
were a team.

406
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,350
We were for a little while.

407
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:45,150
Did about four jobs together,
then decided to call it quits.

408
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,750
Why?

409
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:53,650
You push that woman-man thing too long
and it gets to you after a while.

410
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,850
What's she doin' now?

411
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,450
She hooked up with Frank McGar.
They've done a couple jobs together.

412
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,750
Hell of a woman.
Good little thief.

413
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:09,050
- So explain the telegram.
- Five-man job.

414
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,350
Bustin' in and bustin' out
of a diamond wholesaler's.

415
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,450
Can you move the ice afterwards?
I don't know nobody that can move ice.

416
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,750
No problem.
We got guys waitin' for it.

417
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:20,050
What happened to Marcellus Spivey?
Didn't he always move your ice?

418
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,650
He's doin' 20 years in Susanville.

419
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,950
Twenty years? Holy God.
What for?

420
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,450
Bad luck.

421
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,350
I guess you can say that again.

422
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,250
What's the exposure like?

423
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,250
Two minutes, tops.
But it's a tough two minutes.

424
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,750
Daylight, during business hours,
dealing with a crowd.

425
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,250
But you'll have the guys
to deal with the crowd.

426
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:44,250
- How many employees?
- I'd say around 20.

427
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,050
Security pretty lax.

428
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:48,550
They most usually
just deal in boxes.

429
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:51,550
You know, uncut stones
from the diamond syndicate.

430
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:56,350
But on this day, they're getting a
shipment of polished stones from lsrael.

431
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,650
They're like a way station,
you know?

432
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,050
-They get picked up and sent to Vermont.
-No, they're not.

433
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,550
What's the cut, poppa?

434
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:11,250
Juicy, junior.
Real juicy.

435
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,550
Look, man, you do what you want.

436
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,450
I'm outta here, man. I'm gonna
check into a motel for a few days.

437
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:22,450
You know, I'll lay low
and I'll call Joe--

438
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,150
Shit. Did he fuckin' die on us?

439
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,450
Huh? ls he dead or what?

440
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,850
- He ain't dead.
- What is it?

441
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,650
I think he's just passed out.

442
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:40,850
He scared the fuckin' shit outta me.
I thought he was dead for sure.

443
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:43,650
Without medical attention,
he will die for sure.

444
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,750
What are we gonna do, man?
We can't take him to the hospital.

445
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:53,250
Without medical attention,
he might not live through the night.

446
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:56,150
The bullet in his belly
is my fault.

447
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:59,950
While that might not mean jack shit
to you, it means a hell of a lot to me.

448
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:03,850
First things first, okay?
Stayin' here's goofy. We gotta book up.

449
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,550
So what do you suggest we do?
Go to a hotel?

450
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:10,850
We got a guy who's shot in the belly,
who can't walk, bleeds like a stuck pig.

451
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,250
And when he's awake,
he screams in pain.

452
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,350
You got an idea, spit it out.

453
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,250
Joe could help.

454
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:23,050
If we could get in touch with Joe,
Joe could get him to a doctor.

455
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:26,150
Joe could get a doctor
to come to see him.

456
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:30,350
Assuming we can trust Joe,
how we gonna get in touch with him?

457
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:34,350
He's supposed to be here, but he ain't,
which makes me nervous about bein' here.

458
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:38,150
Even if he is on the up and up, I don't
think he's gonna be too happy with us.

459
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,850
He planned a robbery and
he's got a bloodbath on his hands now.

460
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:44,250
He's got dead cops, dead robbers,
dead civilians.

461
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,050
I tend to doubt he's gonna have
a lot of sympathy for our plight.

462
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:51,850
If I was him, I'd put as much distance
between me and this mess as possible.

463
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:58,350
Before you got here,
Mr. Orange...

464
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:02,250
was askin' me to take him
to a doctor, to a hospital.

465
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:07,350
I don't like the idea of
turnin' him over to the cops...

466
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,150
but if we don't,
he's gonna die.

467
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,050
He begged me to do it.

468
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:17,050
Well, all right.
Then I guess we take him to a hospital.

469
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,250
If that's what he said,
let's do it.

470
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,050
Since he don't know nothin' about us,
I say it's his decision.

471
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,750
He knows a little about me.

472
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:30,150
What? Wait, wait.
You didn't tell him your name, did you?

473
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:33,350
I told him my first name
and where I was from.

474
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,850
Why?

475
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:39,050
I told him where I was from
a few days ago.

476
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,750
It was just
a natural conversation.

477
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:44,850
What was tellin' him your name
when you weren't supposed to?

478
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,550
He asked.

479
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:51,550
We had just gotten away from the cops.
He just got shot.

480
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:55,150
It was my fault he got shot.

481
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,650
He's a fuckin' bloody mess.

482
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,150
He's screamin'.

483
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,350
I swear to God, I thought he was
gonna die right then and there.

484
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:07,350
I'm tryin' to comfort him,
telling him not to worry...

485
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:11,050
everything's going to be okay,
I'm gonna take care of him.

486
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,450
And he asked me
what my name was.

487
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:19,750
I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms.
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

488
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:26,050
Tell him I'm sorry? I can't
give out that fuckin' information?

489
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:29,150
It's against the rules?

490
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,150
I don't trust you enough?

491
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:35,450
Maybe I should've,
but I couldn't.

492
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:38,050
Fuck you! Fuck Joe!

493
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:41,350
- I'm sure it was a beautiful scene.
- Don't fuckin' patronize me!

494
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,850
I have one question. Do they have
a sheet on you where you're from?

495
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,150
- Yeah!
- That's that, then.

496
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:49,150
I mean, I was worried about
mug shot possibility as it was.

497
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:53,550
He knows A, your name, B, your face,
C, your hometown and D, your specialty.

498
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,850
They're not gonna have to show him a lot
of pictures for him to pick you out!

499
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,550
You didn't tell him anything else
so they could narrow down the selection?

500
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:04,250
If I have to tell you again to back off,
we're gonna go 'round and 'round.

501
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,250
We ain't takin' him to a hospital.

502
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,950
If we don't, he's gonna die.

503
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:12,150
And I'm very sad about that, but
some fellas are lucky and some ain't.

504
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,850
What the fuck are you
touchin' me for, man?

505
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,350
I'll show you
who you're fuckin' with!

506
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,550
You wanna shoot me,
you piece of shit?

507
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:27,650
I didn't create this situation,
I'm dealin' with it!

508
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:31,550
You're actin' like a first-year thief!
I'm actin' like a professional!

509
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:34,450
If they get him, they could get you,
they could get closer to me...

510
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,450
and that can't happen!

511
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:39,250
You're lookin' at me like it's my fault?
I didn't tell him my name!

512
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,850
I didn't tell him
where I was from!

513
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:44,550
Shit! Fifteen minutes ago
you almost told me your name!

514
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,750
You're gonna get stuck
in a situation you created!

515
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:50,350
So if you wanna throw bad looks around,
throw 'em at a mirror!

516
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:53,350
You kids shouldn't play so rough.

517
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:56,250
Somebody's gonna start cryin'.

518
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,950
Mr. Blonde.

519
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:02,350
Shit. You're fuckin' kickin' me.

520
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:10,950
What happened to you?
Figured you were dead.

521
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:17,250
Hey, you okay?

522
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,850
Did you see what happened to Blue?

523
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:24,550
We didn't know what happened to you.
That's what we were wonderin' about.

524
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:29,450
Look, Brown is dead,
Orange got it in the belly.

525
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,750
Enough! Enough!

526
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:34,950
You better start talkin', asshole.

527
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,850
'Cause we got shit
we need to talk about.

528
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,650
We're already freaked out.

529
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:43,150
We need you actin' freaky
like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.

530
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,950
Okay, let's talk.

531
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:48,450
We think we got
a rat in the house.

532
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,550
I guarantee we got
a rat in the house.

533
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:52,450
What makes you say that?

534
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:54,450
Is that supposed to be funny?

535
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:57,250
Look, we think
this place ain't safe.

536
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:00,150
This place ain't secure anymore.
We're leavin' and you should go with us.

537
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,450
Nobody's goin' anywhere.

538
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:06,050
Piss on this fuckin' turd.

539
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:09,250
- We're outta here.
- Don't take another step, Mr. White.

540
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:12,150
Fuck you, maniac!

541
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,950
It's your fuckin' fault
we're in this trouble!

542
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,550
What's this guy's problem?

543
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:22,550
What's my problem?
Yeah, I got a fuckin' problem!

544
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:25,450
I got a big fuckin' problem...

545
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,550
with any trigger-happy madman
who almost gets me shot!

546
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:34,050
- What the fuck you talkin' about?
- That fucking shooting spree!

547
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,550
In the store! Remember?

548
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:42,450
Oh, fuck 'em. They set off the alarm.
They deserve what they got.

549
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:44,450
You almost killed me!

550
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,850
Asshole!

551
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:53,250
If I knew what kind of guy you were, I
never would've agreed to work with you.

552
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:58,350
Are you gonna bark all day,
little doggie...

553
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,350
or are you gonna bite?

554
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:02,550
What was that?

555
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:09,050
I'm sorry, I didn't catch it.
Would you repeat it?

556
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,850
Are you gonna bark all day,
little doggie...

557
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,950
or are you gonna bite?

558
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,950
You two assholes, calm the fuck down!
Hey, come on!

559
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,650
What, are we on a playground here?
Am I the only professional?

560
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,050
You're actin' like
a bunch of fuckin' niggers!

561
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:28,450
Ever work with niggers? Always sayin'
they're gonna kill each other.

562
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,450
You said yourself
you thought about taking him out.

563
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:33,050
- You fuckin' said that?
- Yeah, I did, okay?

564
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:36,850
But that was then. Right now, this guy
is the only one I completely trust.

565
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:39,750
-He's too homicidal to be with the cops.
-You takin' his side?

566
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:42,850
Fuck sides, man!
What we need here is solidarity!

567
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:46,850
Somebody's stickin' a red-hot poker
up our ass, and I want to know who.

568
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:51,750
Fuck. Look, I know
I'm no piece of shit.

569
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,650
I'm pretty sure you're okay, and I'm
fuckin' positive you're on the level.

570
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:59,550
So let's try and figure out
who the bad guy is, all right?

571
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,750
Wow.

572
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,950
That was really exciting.

573
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,750
I bet you're a big
Lee Marvin fan, aren't ya?

574
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:16,150
Yeah, me too.
I love that guy.

575
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:22,550
My heart's beatin' so fast,
I'm about to have a heart attack here.

576
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:27,450
I got somethin' outside that
I'd like to show you guys, so follow me.

577
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,350
Follow you? Where?

578
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,950
To my car.

579
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,650
Did you forget your French fries
to go with the soda?

580
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:39,450
No, I had them already. I got somethin'
I think you might wanna see, though.

581
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,450
- What?
- It's a big surprise.

582
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:44,550
I'm sure you'll like it.
Come on.

583
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,750
We still gotta get
outta here, you know.

584
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,350
No. We're gonna stick around
and we're gonna wait.

585
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,750
- What for? The cops?
- No. Nice Guy Eddie.

586
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:07,350
Nice Guy Eddie? What makes you think he
isn't on a plane halfway to Costa Rica?

587
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,750
Because I spoke to him on the phone
and he said he's on the way down here.

588
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:14,050
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why
didn't you say that in the first place?

589
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,950
- 'Cause you never asked me.
- Hardy-fuckin'-har.

590
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:20,150
- What'd he say?
- He said stay put.

591
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,750
So in the meantime...

592
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:25,450
I'll show you guys somethin'.

593
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,650
Jesus Christ.

594
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,750
Maybe our boy in blue here
can answer some of these questions...

595
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:38,150
about this rat business
you've been talkin' about.

596
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:41,250
You're a piece of work,
my friend.

597
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,350
Let's get him
the fuck outta here.

598
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,950
Hey, Sid, will you relax?

599
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:50,350
I've known you a long time.
I'm not worried.

600
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,850
I know you'll pay me back.

601
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:56,750
Don't tell me what I already know.
Don't embarrass me.

602
00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:00,950
So you had a few bad months.
You do what everybody else does.

603
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:05,850
I don't care if it's J.P. Morgan
or lrving the tailor. You ride it out.

604
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,550
- Vic Vega's outside.
- Hold on.

605
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,650
- Who?
- Vic Vega.

606
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,550
Tell him to come in.
I gotta go.

607
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,050
- Come on in.
- A friend of mine's outside.

608
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,750
I'll be talkin' to you.
Don't worry.

609
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,750
Hey, welcome home, Vic.

610
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:29,150
How does freedom feel, huh?

611
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,350
- It's a change.
- Ain't that the sad truth.

612
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:35,350
Sit down, take your coat off,
make yourself at home.

613
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,350
- Have a little drink?
- Yeah.

614
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:40,450
How about a little Remy Martin?

615
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,550
Sure.

616
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,650
Who's your parole officer?

617
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,050
Seymour Scagnetti.

618
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,650
How is he?

619
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,650
He's a fuckin' asshole.

620
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,750
Won't even let me
leave the halfway house.

621
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,350
It never ceases to amaze me.

622
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:01,650
A fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there,
slits a woman's throat for 25 cents...

623
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:04,550
he gets Doris Day
for a parole officer.

624
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:08,250
A good fella like you
winds up with a ball-bustin' prick.

625
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:13,750
I want you to know I appreciate all
the packages you sent me on the inside.

626
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,750
What the hell
was I supposed to do?

627
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,850
Forget about you?

628
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:20,750
I just want you to know
that it meant a lot to me.

629
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:24,450
It was the least I could do. I wish
to hell I could've done a lot more.

630
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:27,450
Thanks a lot, Joe.

631
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,950
Ah, Vic.

632
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,250
Toothpick Vic.

633
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:39,850
So tell me your story, kid.
What are your plans?

634
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:43,450
You son of a bitch. I see you
sittin' there, but I don't believe it.

635
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,950
- How you doin', Toothpick?
- Hey, Eddie.

636
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:53,950
Listen, I'm sorry.
I should've picked you up myself.

637
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,650
I was-- My fuckin'--
This week's been crazy.

638
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,950
I've had my head up my ass
the whole time.

639
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:02,150
Funny you say that, 'cause that's what
me and your daddy were talkin' about.

640
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:04,150
That I should've picked you up?

641
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,950
No, that you had
your head up your ass.

642
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,250
I walk in the door, he's like,
"Vic, Vic...

643
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:15,050
I'm so glad somebody's finally here
who knows what's goin' on.

644
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,750
My son Eddie's a fuck-up.

645
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,750
He's ruining the business.

646
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:24,750
I mean, I love the guy, but he's
flushin' everything down the toilet."

647
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:28,050
That's what you said, right, Joe?
Tell him yourself.

648
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,850
Eddie, I hate for you
to hear it like this...

649
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:34,750
but Vic came in
and asked me how business was.

650
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:37,750
You don't lie to a guy who's
just done four years in the slammer.

651
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,050
That's very true.

652
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,850
All right, enough of this shit!
Break it up!

653
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:49,150
Come on, this ain't a playground!

654
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:58,250
You guys wanna roll around on the floor,
you do it in Eddie's office, not mine.

655
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:01,150
- Daddy, did you see that?
- What?

656
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,350
The guy got me on the ground,
he tried to fuck me.

657
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:06,050
- You wish.
- You sick bastard, Vic.

658
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,550
You tried to fuck me
in my father's office.

659
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:11,850
Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do
in the privacy of your own home...

660
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:14,250
go to it,
but don't try to fuck me.

661
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,450
I don't think of you that way.

662
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:20,650
I like you a lot, buddy,
but I don't think of you that way.

663
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:27,150
Listen, if I was a butt cowboy,
I wouldn't even throw you to the posse.

664
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:30,650
No, you wouldn't.
You'd keep me for yourself.

665
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:35,150
Four years fuckin' punks up the ass,
you'd appreciate a piece of prime rib.

666
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:38,550
I might break you in, Nice Guy,
but I'd make you my dog's bitch.

667
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:40,250
Ain't that a sad sight, Daddy?

668
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:43,550
A man walks into prison a white man,
walks out talkin' like a fuckin' nigger.

669
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:46,650
You know what?
I think it's all that black semen...

670
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,250
pumped up your asshole, now it's
backed into your fuckin' brain...

671
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:52,150
and it's comin' out your mouth!

672
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:56,050
Eddie, you keep talkin' like a bitch,
I'm gonna slap you like a bitch.

673
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:59,050
Enough of that shit!
I'm sick of it!

674
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,250
Now both of you, sit down.

675
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:08,650
Now, Eddie...

676
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:11,650
when you came in here,
we were talkin' some serious business.

677
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:14,750
Vic here's got a parole problem.

678
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:17,750
- Who's your P.O.?
- Seymour Scagnetti.

679
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:20,450
Scagnetti. Fuck.

680
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:24,550
- I hear he's a motherfucker.
- Oh, he's a fucker.

681
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:27,850
Won't even let me leave the halfway
house unless I get some shitty job.

682
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:30,250
You're comin' back
to work for us, right?

683
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,750
Well, I wanna.

684
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:38,650
But first I gotta prove to,
uh, ass-head...

685
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:42,150
that I can get a regular,
you know, job-type job...

686
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:45,350
before I can move out on my own.

687
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:48,850
I can't come back to work for you guys
if I gotta worry about, uh...

688
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:51,250
makin' some silly-ass
10:00 curfew...

689
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:53,250
every fuckin' night.

690
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:56,750
We can work this out,
can't we, Eddie?

691
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:58,750
This ain't all that bad.

692
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:01,950
We can get you
a lot of legitimate jobs.

693
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:05,150
I'll get you down in Long Beach
as a dockworker.

694
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:08,550
I don't wanna lift
no fuckin' crates, Eddie.

695
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:12,050
You ain't gonna lift shit.
You don't even work there.

696
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:15,150
But as far as the records
are concerned, you do.

697
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:19,150
I call Matthews and tell him he's got
a new guy, boom, you're on the rotation.

698
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:23,150
You get a time card. It's clocked
in and out for you every day.

699
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:27,850
At the end of the week you get a nice
paycheck. Dockworkers do very well.

700
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:30,550
You can move into a halfway decent place
without Scagnetti goin'...

701
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,850
"Where the fuck's
the money comin' from?"

702
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:36,450
And, if he decides
to make a surprise visit...

703
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:40,850
that's the day we sent you to Tustin
to pick up a load of shit.

704
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:44,050
If he comes back again, hey,
"Sorry, Seymour.

705
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:45,750
You just missed him.

706
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:49,350
We had to send him to the Taft airstrip
five fuckin' hours away.

707
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:52,150
We had a load of shit he had to
pick up there and bring back here."

708
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:55,850
Part of your job is goin' different
places. That's the beauty of it.

709
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:58,550
We got places all over the place.

710
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:00,850
See, Vic?
Did I tell you not to worry?

711
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:04,850
- Vic was worried.
- I'll take you to Long Beach tomorrow.

712
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:08,850
We'll get you fixed up with Matthews,
I'll tell him what's what.

713
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:13,250
You know, I really appreciate
what you guys are doin'...

714
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:16,050
but I'd like to know
when I can come back...

715
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:18,350
you know, do some real work.

716
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:20,750
Well, it's hard to say.

717
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:23,750
It's kind of a strange time now.

718
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:26,250
Things are kind of--

719
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:29,350
They're a little fucked up,
is what they are.

720
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:32,550
We're just gettin' ready for
a big meetin' right now in Vegas.

721
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:37,150
Look, just let Eddie for now
set you up at Long Beach.

722
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:40,550
Get you a job,
give you some cash...

723
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:43,750
and get this Scagnetti fuck
off your back...

724
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:47,050
and then we'll talk
to you, all right?

725
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:48,150
Huh?

726
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:51,950
Dad, I got an idea.

727
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:54,750
Just hear me out.

728
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:58,350
I know you don't like usin'
the boys on these jobs...

729
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:02,850
but Vic here-- I mean, he's only
been nothin' but good luck for us.

730
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,950
The guy's a fuckin' rabbit's foot,
for cryin' out loud.

731
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:09,450
I'd like to have him in.

732
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:13,150
You know he can handle himself, and
you damn sure know you can trust him.

733
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:16,850
All right, Vic...

734
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:21,050
how would you feel about pullin'
a job with about five other guys?

735
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:25,750
I'd feel great about it.

736
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:34,250
K-BILLY's "Super Sounds
of the '70s" continues.

737
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:36,450
If you're the 12th caller...

738
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:39,950
you'll win two tickets to
the monster truck extravaganza...

739
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:43,250
being held tonight
at the Carson Fairgrounds...

740
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:48,350
featuring Big Daddy Don Bodine's truck,
"The Behemoth."

741
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:53,350
The 12th caller wins on the station
where the '70s survived.

742
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:01,950
Hey, Dov, we got
a major situation here.

743
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,550
I know you know that. I gotta talk to
Daddy and find out what he wants done.

744
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:17,750
All I know is what Vic told me.
The place turned into a bullet-fest.

745
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:20,350
He took a cop hostage
just to get the fuck outta there.

746
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:22,350
Get up! Get up!

747
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,750
Do I sound like
I'm fuckin' jokin'?

748
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:30,150
He's fuckin' drivin' around
with a cop in his trunk!

749
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:36,850
I don't know who did what!

750
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:40,050
I don't know who's got the loot.
I don't know if anybody's got the loot.

751
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:44,050
I don't know who's dead, who's alive,
who's caught, who's not.

752
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,750
I will know.
I'm practically there now.

753
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:06,750
But what do I tell
these guys about Daddy?

754
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:12,150
All right.
You sure that's what he said?

755
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:15,850
Okay, that's what I'll tell 'em.

756
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:17,950
Huh? Fuck you!

757
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:20,550
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?

758
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:22,150
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?

759
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:28,250
You're gonna suffer
for nothin', pal.

760
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:30,650
You hear me?
'Cause you're gonna fuckin' talk.

761
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:33,650
- I don't fucking know anything!
- You fuckin' know.

762
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,350
You know. Look at me.
You fuckin' know.

763
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:38,850
What in the Sam Hill's
goin' on here?

764
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:42,050
- Nice Guy, we got a cop.
- Where the fuck is Joe?

765
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:45,250
Holy shit. Orange is dead.

766
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:49,250
No, he's not dead, but he will be
if we don't get him taken care of.

767
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:51,750
We were set up.
The cops were there waitin' for us.

768
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:54,150
What? Nobody fuckin'
set anybody up.

769
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,850
The cops were there
waitin' for us.

770
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:57,650
- Bullshit.
- Fuck you, man!

771
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:01,050
You weren't there, we were,
and the cops had that store staked out.

772
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:04,450
Okay, Mr. Fuckin' Detective,
you're so fuckin' smart.

773
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:07,850
- Who did it?
- We've been askin' each other!

774
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:10,850
What'd you come up with?
You think I fuckin' set you up?

775
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:13,750
I don't know, but somebody did.

776
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:18,550
Nobody did. You fuckin' assholes
turned the jewelry store--

777
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:21,650
- Don't you call me an asshole!
- You fuckin' idiot!

778
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:23,750
Turned the jewelry store
into a wild west show...

779
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:26,250
and you wonder why
the fuckin' cops show up?

780
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:29,250
Where's Joseph?

781
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:31,550
I don't know.
I ain't talked to him.

782
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:36,050
I talked to Dov. He says Daddy's comin'
down here and he's fuckin' pissed.

783
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:38,550
He's pissed?
I told you he'd be pissed.

784
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:40,150
What'd Joe say?

785
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,150
I told you,
I ain't talked to him!

786
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:45,150
- All I know is he's pissed.
- What are you gonna do about him?

787
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:49,450
Give me a fuckin' chance to breathe.
I got a few questions of my own here.

788
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:50,850
You ain't dying. He is.

789
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:54,450
All right, Mr. Fuckin' Compassion,
I will call somebody!

790
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:56,350
Who?

791
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,850
A fuckin' snake charmer!
Who do you think? I'll call a doctor.

792
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:03,750
They'll fix him right up.
What happened to Brown and Blue?

793
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:06,150
Brown's dead.
We don't know what happened to Blue.

794
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:08,050
Brown's dead? Are you sure?

795
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:12,150
I'm sure. I was there.
He took one in the head.

796
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,450
Nobody's got a clue
what happened to Mr. Blue?

797
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:16,750
Either he's alive or he's dead...

798
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:19,850
or the cops got him
or they don't.

799
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:25,250
I take it this is the bastard
you told me about.

800
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:27,250
Why are you beatin' on him?

801
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:29,750
Maybe he could tell us
who set us up.

802
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:34,050
You beat this prick long enough, he'll
tell you he started the Chicago Fire.

803
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:36,850
Now that don't necessarily
make it fuckin' so!

804
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:39,150
Come on, man, think!

805
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:42,650
All right,
first things fuckin' last.

806
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:47,250
Who's got the stones? Please, somebody
tell me one little fuckin' favor.

807
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,850
I got a bag.

808
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:52,950
Okay? I stashed it 'til we could be sure
this place wasn't a police station.

809
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:55,350
Good for you.
Now let's go get it.

810
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:59,650
First we gotta get rid of those cars.
It looks like Sam's Hot Car Lot outside.

811
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:00,750
Okay.

812
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:04,750
Blondie, stay here
and baby-sit them two.

813
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:07,450
White and Pink,
take a car each.

814
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:11,150
I'll follow you. You ditch 'em.
Pick up the stones.

815
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:14,350
While I'm followin' you, I'll arrange
some sort of a doctor for our friend.

816
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:16,350
You can't leave these guys
here with him.

817
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:19,850
- Why not?
- Because he's a fuckin' psycho.

818
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:23,250
And if you think
Joe's pissed off...

819
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:26,250
that ain't nothin' compared
to how pissed off I am at him...

820
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:28,450
for puttin' me
in the same room as that bastard.

821
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:33,150
You see what I've been
puttin' up with, Eddie?

822
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:38,250
I fuckin' walked in here,
I told these guys about stayin' put.

823
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:41,350
Mr. White whips out his gun,
he's stickin' it in my face...

824
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:45,250
callin' me a motherfucker,
sayin' he's gonna blow me away...

825
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:47,450
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

826
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:50,950
He's the reason the joint
turned into a shootin' spree.

827
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:53,650
What are you,
a fuckin' silent partner?

828
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,550
Tell him!

829
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:58,150
He went crazy in the store,
but he seems all right now.

830
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:03,150
This is what he was doin':
bam, bam...

831
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:05,950
bam, bam.

832
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:08,350
Yeah, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

833
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:11,550
I told 'em not to touch
the fuckin' alarm, they did.

834
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:16,150
If they hadn't have done what I told 'em
not to do, they'd still be alive.

835
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:19,950
My fuckin' hero.

836
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:23,650
Thanks.

837
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:26,450
That's your excuse for going
on a kill-crazy rampage?

838
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,650
I don't like alarms, Mr. White.

839
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:34,550
What does it matter
who stays with the cop?

840
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,650
We ain't lettin' him go.
He's seen everybody.

841
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:38,750
I haven't been looking at you guys.

842
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:41,350
Shut the fuck up, man!

843
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:44,250
You guys should never have taken him
outta the trunk in the first place.

844
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:48,350
- We tried to find out about the setup.
- There is no fuckin' setup!

845
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:50,150
Now here's the news!

846
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:53,350
Blondie, you stay here,
take care of these two!

847
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:55,650
White and Pink, you come with me,
'cause if Joe gets here...

848
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,950
and he sees all these
cars parked outside...

849
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:01,050
I swear to you he's gonna be
just as mad at me as he is at you.

850
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,150
Fine. Let's go.

851
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:25,850
Alone at last.

852
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:49,750
Guess what.

853
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:52,450
I think I'm parked in the red zone.

854
00:52:57,650 --> 00:53:00,350
Now, where were we?

855
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:05,250
I told you, I don't know anything
about any fuckin' setup.

856
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,750
I've been on the force
for only eight months.

857
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:11,050
They don't tell me anything.

858
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:15,650
Nobody tells me shit.
You can torture me all you want.

859
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,950
Torture you?
That's a good--

860
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:21,150
That's a good idea.
I like that one, yeah.

861
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:25,850
Even your boss said
there wasn't a setup.

862
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:30,950
- My what?
- Your boss.

863
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:33,950
Excuse me, pal.

864
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:38,050
One thing I wanna make clear to you:
I don't have a boss.

865
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:41,150
Nobody tells me what to do.
You understand?

866
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:43,750
You hear what I said,
you son of a bitch?

867
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:46,950
All right, all right, all right,
you don't have a boss.

868
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:52,150
Get that fuckin' shit off.

869
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:03,450
Look, I'm not gonna
bullshit you, okay?

870
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,150
I don't really give a good fuck
what you know or don't know...

871
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:12,150
but I'm gonna
torture you anyway...

872
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:15,650
regardless.

873
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,050
Not to get information.

874
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:21,650
It's amusing to me...

875
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:24,150
to torture a cop.

876
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:27,350
You can say anything you want
because I've heard it all before.

877
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:31,150
All you can do is...

878
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:33,450
pray for a quick death...

879
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:38,650
which...

880
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,850
you ain't gonna get.

881
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:57,850
Oh, God.

882
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:10,150
You ever listen to K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s"?

883
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:15,850
It's my personal favorite.

884
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:26,750
Joe Egan and Gerry Rafferty
were a duo known as Stealer's Wheel...

885
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:30,850
when they recorded this Dylanesque,
pop, bubble-gum favorite...

886
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:34,050
from April of 1974.

887
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:36,050
That reached up to number five...

888
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:39,550
as K-BILLY's "Super Sounds
of the '70s" continues.

889
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:30,650
Hold still.

890
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:32,850
Hold still, you fuck.

891
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:55,750
Was that good for you too?

892
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:58,350
Hey, what's goin' on?

893
00:56:58,350 --> 00:56:59,850
You hear that?

894
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:12,750
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

895
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,350
Don't! Stop! Stop!

896
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:03,750
- What? What's the matter?
- Don't do this.

897
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:06,850
That burn a little bit?

898
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,350
Don't! Stop!

899
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:14,150
Please stop.

900
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:16,350
Just stop. Stop.

901
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:18,350
Just talk to me.
Don't. Please.

902
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:20,050
Don't burn me, please.

903
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:26,950
I don't know anything about
any of you fucking guys.

904
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:28,950
I'm not gonna say anything.

905
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:32,250
No! Please, no.

906
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:33,850
- You all through?
- Stop!

907
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:35,050
You all through?

908
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:38,650
Please.
I got a little kid at home.

909
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:40,450
You all done?

910
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:42,450
- Don't!
- Have some fire.

911
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:48,450
Oh, shit.

912
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:52,050
Hey, you.

913
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:57,150
What's your name?

914
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:01,650
Marvin.

915
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:04,850
Marvin what?

916
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:10,650
Marvin Nash.

917
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:19,150
Listen to me, Marvin.
I'm a--

918
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:24,850
Listen to me, Marvin Nash.
I'm a cop.

919
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,450
Yeah, I know.

920
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:32,550
You do?

921
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:37,050
Yeah.
Your name's Freddy somethin'.

922
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:39,750
Newendyke.

923
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:42,950
Freddy Newendyke.

924
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:48,950
Frankie Ferchetti...

925
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:52,850
introduced us
about five months ago.

926
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:58,250
I don't remember that at all.

927
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:03,350
I do.

928
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:08,850
Freddy.

929
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:18,950
How do I look?

930
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:23,150
What?

931
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:33,650
I don't know what to tell you,
Marvin.

932
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:38,850
That fuck.

933
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:43,850
That sick fuck!

934
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:46,850
That fuckin' bastard!

935
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:52,250
Marvin, I need you to hold on.

936
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:55,250
There's cops waiting to move
a block away.

937
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:59,350
What the fuck
are they waiting for?

938
01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:02,650
This fuckin' guy,
he slashes my face...

939
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:05,250
and cuts my fuckin' ear off!

940
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:07,550
I'm fuckin' deformed!

941
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:09,150
Fuck you!

942
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:12,550
I'm fuckin' dyin' here!

943
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:14,650
I'm fuckin' dyin'!

944
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:27,150
They're not to make a move
'til Joe Cabot shows up.

945
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:30,050
I was sent in to get him.

946
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:31,650
All right?

947
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:34,750
You heard 'em.
They said he's on his way.

948
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:37,250
Don't pussy out on me now,
Marvin.

949
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:41,450
We're just gonna sit here
and bleed...

950
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:44,950
'til Joe Cabot sticks
his fuckin' head through that door.

951
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:07,950
Say hello to a motherfucker
who's inside.

952
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:10,850
Cabot's doing a job.
He wants me on the team.

953
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:13,350
This better not be a joke.

954
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:17,150
This ain't a joke.
I'm in. I'm up his ass.

955
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:27,650
Nice Guy Eddie tells me
Joe wants to meet me.

956
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:31,650
He says I should just wait
for a phone call.

957
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:36,050
After waiting three days he calls me
last night and says Joe's ready.

958
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:39,150
- He'll pick me up in 15 minutes.
- Who picked you up?

959
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,850
- Nice Guy. We get to a bar.
- What bar?

960
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:43,450
Smokey Pete's in Gardena.

961
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:45,150
We get there...

962
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:48,150
and I meet Joe
and a guy named Mr. White.

963
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:50,150
Phony name.
My name's Mr. Orange.

964
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:53,050
- Mr. Orange?
- Mr. Orange.

965
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:56,250
Okay, Mr. Orange.

966
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:59,950
- You ever see this motherfucker before?
- Who? Mr. White?

967
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:01,650
Yes. Mr. White.

968
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:07,250
No. He ain't one of Cabot's men either.
He's gotta be from out of town.

969
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:09,550
- Joe knows him good.
- How can you tell?

970
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:12,650
The way they talk.
You can tell they're buddies.

971
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:14,850
- You two talk?
- Me and Joe?

972
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:16,850
Mr. White.

973
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:18,550
- A little.
- About what?

974
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:19,650
The Brewers.

975
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,150
Milwaukee Brewers?

976
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:24,350
They won the night before.
He made some money off them.

977
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:29,150
Good. If this crook's a Brewers fan,
he's gotta be from Wisconsin.

978
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:32,050
And I'll bet you everything...

979
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:35,250
they got a sheet in Milwaukee
on this Mr. White's ass.

980
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:39,650
So I want you to go through
everybody in Milwaukee...

981
01:05:39,650 --> 01:05:43,150
with a history of armed robbery
and put a name to the face.

982
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:45,750
- Nice work, Freddy.
- Thank you, my man.

983
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:49,450
- How was Long Beach Mike's referral?
- Perfect.

984
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:53,750
His backing me up went a long way.
I told them I played poker with him.

985
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:56,750
Nice Guy checked it out
and said it was A-okay.

986
01:05:56,850 --> 01:05:59,750
Said I was a good thief,
I didn't rattle...

987
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:02,150
and that I was ready to move.

988
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,950
He's a good guy.
I wouldn't be inside without him.

989
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:09,450
Long Beach Mike
is not your friend.

990
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:11,750
Long Beach Mike
is a fucking scumbag.

991
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:13,750
He's selling out his friends.

992
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:16,650
That's how nice he fuckin' is.

993
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:18,650
I'll take care of his ass...

994
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:22,550
but you get that scumbag out of mind
and take care of business.

995
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:24,250
Gone.

996
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:31,950
Use the commode story?

997
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:35,550
- What's the commode story?
- It's a scene. Memorize it.

998
01:06:37,450 --> 01:06:40,750
- A what?
- Undercover cops gotta be Brando.

999
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:44,050
To do this job you gotta be
a great actor, naturalistic.

1000
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:46,850
You gotta be naturalistic as hell.

1001
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:51,950
If you're a bad actor,
that's bullshit in this job.

1002
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:53,350
What is this?

1003
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:56,350
That's an amusing anecdote
about a drug deal.

1004
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:02,750
Something funny that happened to you
while you were doing a job.

1005
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:06,150
I gotta memorize all this?
There's four pages of this shit.

1006
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:08,850
Think about it like it's a joke.

1007
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:12,050
Memorize what's important.
The rest you make your own.

1008
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:14,050
You can tell a joke,
can't you?

1009
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:17,150
Well, pretend you're Don Rickles...

1010
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:19,150
and tell a joke, all right?

1011
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:22,050
The things you gotta remember
are the details.

1012
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:24,150
The details sell your story.

1013
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:27,250
This particular story
takes place in a men's room.

1014
01:07:27,350 --> 01:07:29,950
You gotta know
all the details--

1015
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:33,850
whether they got paper towels
or a blower to dry your hands.

1016
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:37,650
You gotta know if the stalls
ain't got no doors or not.

1017
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:40,750
You gotta know if they got liquid soap
or that pink, granulated shit...

1018
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:42,750
they used in high school.

1019
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:45,750
You gotta know if they got
hot water or not, if it stinks...

1020
01:07:45,850 --> 01:07:49,250
if some nasty, lowlife,
scum-ridden motherfucker...

1021
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:51,750
sprayed diarrhea
all over one of the bowls.

1022
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:55,150
You gotta know every detail
there is to know about this commode.

1023
01:07:55,250 --> 01:08:00,150
What you gotta do is take
all them details and make 'em your own.

1024
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:04,050
While you're doing that, remember
that this story is about you...

1025
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:07,350
and how you perceived
the events that went down.

1026
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:09,350
The only way to do that...

1027
01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:12,350
is keep sayin' it...

1028
01:08:12,450 --> 01:08:14,950
and sayin' it and sayin' it.

1029
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:23,250
This is during
the L.A. marijuana drought, 1986.

1030
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:26,650
I still had a connection,
which was insane 'cause...

1031
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:28,950
you couldn't get any weed
anywhere then.

1032
01:08:30,450 --> 01:08:34,350
Anyway, I had a connection with
this hippie chick in Santa Cruz...

1033
01:08:34,450 --> 01:08:36,350
and all my friends knew it.

1034
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:39,150
They call me and say,
"Hey, Freddy--"

1035
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:42,950
I say, "Hey, dude.

1036
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:47,150
You gettin' some?
Can you get some for me too?"

1037
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:52,050
They knew I still smoked,
so they asked me to buy some for them.

1038
01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:53,550
It got to be--

1039
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:03,550
Every time I bought some weed
I was buyin' for four or five people.

1040
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:08,250
Finally I said, fuck this shit.
I'm makin' this bitch rich.

1041
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:11,750
She didn't even have to
meet these people.

1042
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:13,750
I was doing all the work.

1043
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:18,150
That got to be a pain in the ass,
people calling all the time.

1044
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:21,850
I couldn't even rent a tape
without six fuckin' interruptions.

1045
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:24,050
"When's the next time
you're gettin' some?"

1046
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:26,550
"Motherfucker, I'm tryin'
to watch The Lost Boys.

1047
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:28,550
When I get some,
I'll call you."

1048
01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:32,050
Then these rink-a-dink
potheads come by.

1049
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:34,650
They're my friends and everything,
but still--

1050
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:38,050
I got it laid out in 60-dollar bags,
they don't want 60 dollars worth.

1051
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:41,450
They want ten dollars' worth,
and breaking it up wasn't easy.

1052
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:45,150
I don't even know
what ten dollars' worth looks like.

1053
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:47,450
This was a very weird situation.

1054
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:50,850
Remember back in '86...

1055
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:53,250
there was a major
fuckin' drought.

1056
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:54,750
Nobody had anything.

1057
01:09:54,850 --> 01:09:58,150
People were livin' on resin,
smokin' the wood in their pipes.

1058
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:02,150
This chick had a bunch
and she's beggin' me to sell it.

1059
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:05,150
So I told her I wasn't gonna be
Joe the pot man anymore...

1060
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:09,050
but I would take a little bit
and sell it to my close friends.

1061
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:11,750
She agreed and we kept
the same arrangement as before--

1062
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:13,750
ten percent
and free pot for me...

1063
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:15,750
if I helped her
that weekend.

1064
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:19,150
She was sellin' a brick of weed
and didn't wanna go to the buy alone.

1065
01:10:19,150 --> 01:10:22,650
Her brother usually goes with her,
but he's in County unexpectedly.

1066
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:23,850
What for?

1067
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:25,750
His traffic tickets
gone to warrant.

1068
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:29,650
They stopped him, found warrants
on him, took him to County.

1069
01:10:29,650 --> 01:10:32,650
She doesn't wanna walk around alone
with all that weed.

1070
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:36,450
I don't wanna do this.
I have a very bad feeling about it.

1071
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:38,550
She keeps asking me, asking me.

1072
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:41,550
Finally I said okay
'cause I'm sick of hearing it.

1073
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:43,850
- So we go to the train station--
- Wait.

1074
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:46,950
You're goin' to the train station
with the weed on ya?

1075
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:49,150
The guy needed it right away.

1076
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:51,550
Anyway, we get to
the train station...

1077
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:53,650
and we're waitin' for the guy.

1078
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:56,250
I'm carryin' the weed
in a carry-on bag.

1079
01:10:56,350 --> 01:11:01,050
I gotta take a piss, so I tell her
I'm goin' to the boy's room.

1080
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:08,250
So I walk into the men's room
and who's standing there?

1081
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:13,350
Four Los Angeles County sheriffs
and a German shepherd.

1082
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:19,050
- They're waitin' for you?
- No, they're just talkin'.

1083
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:22,150
When I walked in,
they all stopped talkin'...

1084
01:11:22,250 --> 01:11:24,550
and they looked at me.

1085
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:27,450
That's hard.
That's a fuckin' hard situation.

1086
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:30,150
German shepherd starts barking.

1087
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:33,450
He's barkin' at me.

1088
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:36,150
I mean, it's obvious
he's barkin' at me.

1089
01:11:38,050 --> 01:11:41,850
Every nerve ending, all of my senses,
the blood in the veins was screamin':

1090
01:11:41,950 --> 01:11:45,950
"Take off, man. Just bail.
Get the fuck outta there."

1091
01:11:45,950 --> 01:11:48,450
Panic hits me
like a bucket of water.

1092
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:50,050
Bam! Right in the face.

1093
01:11:50,150 --> 01:11:55,050
I'm drenched in panic and these cops
are lookin' at me and they know it.

1094
01:11:55,150 --> 01:11:58,550
They can smell it,
sure as that fuckin' dog can.

1095
01:11:58,650 --> 01:12:00,550
They can smell it on me.

1096
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:03,050
Shut up.

1097
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:07,550
So anyway,
I got my gun drawn.

1098
01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:10,550
I point it at this guy
and I tell him...

1099
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:13,050
"Freeze.
Don't fuckin' move."

1100
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:16,050
This little idiot's
looking right at me and saying...

1101
01:12:16,150 --> 01:12:17,950
"I know, I know."

1102
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:21,450
But meanwhile his right hand
is creepin' toward the glove box.

1103
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:26,350
I scream at him, "Asshole!
I'm gonna blow you away right now!

1104
01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:28,550
Put your hands on the dash."

1105
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:31,650
He's still looking at me,
nodding his head.

1106
01:12:31,650 --> 01:12:34,050
"I know, buddy, I know."

1107
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:37,850
Meanwhile his hand is still
going for the glove box.

1108
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:39,550
And I said...

1109
01:12:39,650 --> 01:12:43,550
"Buddy, I'm gonna shoot you
in the face...

1110
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:46,250
if you don't put your hands up."

1111
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:51,850
Then this guy's girlfriend,
this real sexy Oriental bitch...

1112
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:55,250
she starts screaming at him:
"Chuck, what are you doin'?

1113
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:58,550
Listen to the officer!
Put your hands on the dash!"

1114
01:12:58,650 --> 01:13:02,850
So then the guy snaps out of it
and puts his hands on the dash.

1115
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:04,350
What was he goin' for?

1116
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:06,650
His fucking registration.

1117
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:09,550
- You're kidding.
- No, man!

1118
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:13,250
Stupid citizen doesn't know how close
he came to gettin' blown away.

1119
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:14,750
That close, man.

1120
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:50,350
You knew how to handle
that situation.

1121
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:53,350
You shit your pants,
dive in and swim.

1122
01:13:55,950 --> 01:13:57,950
Tell me more about Cabot.

1123
01:13:57,950 --> 01:13:59,850
I don't know.

1124
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:01,850
He's a cool guy.

1125
01:14:03,550 --> 01:14:06,250
He's funny.
He's a funny guy.

1126
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:09,250
You remember
the Fantastic Four?

1127
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:12,250
Yeah, with that invisible bitch...

1128
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:14,250
and "Flame on"
and shit, right?

1129
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:16,650
Thing.

1130
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:18,550
Motherfucker...

1131
01:14:18,650 --> 01:14:20,650
Iooks just like the Thing.

1132
01:14:24,850 --> 01:14:27,450
Hey! Showtime!

1133
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:30,450
Grab your jacket.
I'm parked outside.

1134
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:32,350
I'll be right down.

1135
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:35,150
He'll be right down.

1136
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:57,250
Don't pussy out on me now.

1137
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:59,250
They don't know.

1138
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:01,550
They don't know shit.

1139
01:16:01,650 --> 01:16:04,750
You're not gonna get hurt.
You're fuckin' Baretta.

1140
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:08,250
They believe every fuckin' word
'cause you're super cool.

1141
01:16:15,650 --> 01:16:17,050
There goes our boy.

1142
01:16:17,150 --> 01:16:20,250
The guy has to have rocks in his head
the size of Gibraltar...

1143
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:21,850
to work undercover.

1144
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:24,850
- You want one of these?
- Yeah, give me the bear claw.

1145
01:16:40,850 --> 01:16:42,850
I know what I'm talking about.

1146
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:45,550
Black women ain't the same
as white women.

1147
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:47,050
There's a slight difference.

1148
01:16:47,150 --> 01:16:49,850
Very funny.
You know what I mean.

1149
01:16:49,950 --> 01:16:53,450
What a white bitch will put up with,
a black bitch wouldn't for a minute.

1150
01:16:53,550 --> 01:16:56,350
If you cross their line,
they fuck you up.

1151
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:58,950
I gotta go along with Pink
on that.

1152
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:01,850
Okay, Mr. Expert,
if this is such a truism...

1153
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:06,350
why is it that every nigger I know
treats his woman like a piece of shit?

1154
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:09,850
I'll bet those same niggers
who show their ass in public...

1155
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:12,850
when their bitches get 'em home
they chill the fuck out.

1156
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:16,050
- Not these guys.
- Oh, yeah. Those guys too.

1157
01:17:16,150 --> 01:17:18,150
Tell you guys a story.

1158
01:17:18,150 --> 01:17:23,050
In one of Daddy's clubs there's
a black cocktail waitress named Elois.

1159
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:25,150
- Elois?
- Yeah, Elois.

1160
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:28,750
E and Lois.
We called her Lady E.

1161
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:30,750
Where was she from?
Compton?

1162
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:34,250
She's from Ladora Heights.

1163
01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:36,750
Ladora Heights.
The black Beverly Hills.

1164
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:40,150
It's not
the black Beverly Hills.

1165
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:42,850
It's the black Palos Verdes.

1166
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:44,750
Anyway...

1167
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:49,150
Lady E, she was a man-eater-upper.
Un-fuckin'-believable.

1168
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:54,050
Every guy who ever saw her
had to jack off to her at least once.

1169
01:17:54,150 --> 01:17:57,050
You know who she looked like?
Christie Love.

1170
01:17:57,150 --> 01:17:59,050
Remember that TV show
Get Christie Love...

1171
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:01,450
about the black female cop?

1172
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:04,450
She always used to say,
"You're under arrest, sugar! "

1173
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:09,450
- Who played Christie Love?
- Pam Grier.

1174
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:12,450
No, it wasn't Pam Grier.
Pam Grier was the other one.

1175
01:18:12,450 --> 01:18:14,450
Pam Grier did the film.

1176
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:19,150
Christie Love was like
a Pam Grier TV show without Pam Grier.

1177
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:22,450
- So, who was Christie Love?
- How should I know?

1178
01:18:22,450 --> 01:18:24,450
Great. Now I'm totally
fuckin' tortured.

1179
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:27,750
Whoever it was,
she looked exactly like Elois.

1180
01:18:27,850 --> 01:18:29,250
Anne Francis.

1181
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:32,050
No. That was Honey West.

1182
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:33,850
Anne Francis is white.

1183
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:38,150
I'm tryin' to tell a story here.
She looked exactly like Elois.

1184
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:40,850
We come into the club
one night...

1185
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:42,850
and there's Carlos,
the bartender.

1186
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:46,050
He's a wetback.
He's a friend of mine.

1187
01:18:46,150 --> 01:18:48,750
I says to him,
"Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?"

1188
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:51,850
Apparently Lady E...

1189
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:55,250
was married to real piece
of dog shit, a real animal.

1190
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:57,550
He used to do things to her.

1191
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:59,550
Like what?
What would he do?

1192
01:18:59,650 --> 01:19:01,350
Beat her up?

1193
01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:04,350
I don't know.
He just did things.

1194
01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:08,050
So anyway, one night
she plays it real cool.

1195
01:19:08,150 --> 01:19:10,450
She waits for him to get drunk.

1196
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:13,450
He falls asleep
on the fuckin' couch.

1197
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:17,850
She sneaks up on him,
puts some glue on his dick...

1198
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:20,150
and glues his dick
to his belly.

1199
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:22,950
Jesus Christ!

1200
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:25,850
I'm serious, man.
I'm dead serious.

1201
01:19:25,950 --> 01:19:29,250
They had to call the paramedics
to cut the prick loose.

1202
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:32,450
Was he all pissed off?

1203
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:38,750
How would you feel if you had to do
a fuckin' handstand to take a piss?

1204
01:19:43,050 --> 01:19:47,050
You guys like to tell jokes
and giggle and kid around, huh?

1205
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:50,050
Giggling like a bunch of girls
in the schoolyard.

1206
01:19:50,050 --> 01:19:52,050
Well, let me tell a joke.

1207
01:19:53,050 --> 01:19:55,750
Five guys
sittin' in a bullpen...

1208
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:57,650
San Quentin...

1209
01:19:57,750 --> 01:20:00,650
wonderin' how the fuck
they got there.

1210
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:04,150
"What did we do wrong?
What shouldn't we have done?

1211
01:20:04,150 --> 01:20:06,150
It's your fault, his fault--"

1212
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:07,950
All that bullshit.

1213
01:20:08,050 --> 01:20:09,750
Finally somebody says...

1214
01:20:09,850 --> 01:20:12,050
"Wait a minute.

1215
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:14,150
While we were
planning this caper...

1216
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:16,750
we just sat around
tellin' fuckin' jokes."

1217
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:18,550
Got the message?

1218
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:22,750
I don't mean to holler at ya.

1219
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:27,350
When this caper's over,
and I'm sure it'll be successful...

1220
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:30,850
we'll go down to Hawaiian lslands,
I'll laugh with all of youse.

1221
01:20:30,850 --> 01:20:32,950
Find me a different character
down there.

1222
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:35,350
Right now it's a matter
of business.

1223
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:38,950
With the exception
of Eddie and myself...

1224
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:40,850
who you already know...

1225
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:43,750
we're gonna be using aliases
on this job.

1226
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:46,250
Under no circumstances...

1227
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:49,550
do we want any one of you
to relate to each other...

1228
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:51,850
by your Christian names.

1229
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:56,250
And I don't want any talk
about yourself personally.

1230
01:20:56,350 --> 01:21:00,250
That includes where you been,
your wife's name...

1231
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:02,250
where you might've done time...

1232
01:21:02,350 --> 01:21:06,150
or a bank maybe you robbed
in St. Petersburg.

1233
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:10,150
All I want you guys to talk about,
if you have to...

1234
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:12,850
is what you're gonna do.

1235
01:21:12,950 --> 01:21:15,050
That should do it.

1236
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:17,650
These are your names--

1237
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:20,650
Mr. Brown, Mr. White...

1238
01:21:20,650 --> 01:21:23,150
Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue...

1239
01:21:23,150 --> 01:21:25,350
Mr. Orange and Mr. Pink.

1240
01:21:25,450 --> 01:21:29,050
- Why am I Mr. Pink?
- Because you're a faggot! All right?

1241
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:33,350
- Why can't we pick our own colors?
- No way.

1242
01:21:33,450 --> 01:21:36,050
No way. Tried it once.
It doesn't work.

1243
01:21:36,150 --> 01:21:39,550
You get four guys all fightin'
over who gets to be Mr. Black.

1244
01:21:39,650 --> 01:21:43,050
They don't know each other,
so nobody wants to back down.

1245
01:21:43,150 --> 01:21:45,450
No way. I pick.
You're Mr. Pink.

1246
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:47,650
Be thankful
you're not Mr. Yellow.

1247
01:21:48,850 --> 01:21:51,150
But Mr. Brown,
that's too close to Mr. Shit.

1248
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:53,150
Mr. Pink
sounds like Mr. Pussy.

1249
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:55,050
How about Mr. Purple?

1250
01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:57,150
That's sounds good.
I'll be Mr. Purple.

1251
01:21:57,250 --> 01:21:59,650
You're not Mr. Purple.

1252
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:03,950
Some guy on some other job
is Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink!

1253
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:05,850
Who cares what your name is?

1254
01:22:05,850 --> 01:22:09,550
Easy for you to say. You're Mr. White.
You have a cool-sounding name.

1255
01:22:09,650 --> 01:22:13,350
If it's no big deal to be Mr. Pink,
you wanna trade?

1256
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:16,150
Nobody's tradin' with anybody.

1257
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:19,350
This ain't a goddamn fuckin'
city council meeting, you know.

1258
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:23,150
Now listen up, Mr. Pink.

1259
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:25,750
There's two ways you can go
on this job--

1260
01:22:25,850 --> 01:22:28,150
my way or the highway.

1261
01:22:28,150 --> 01:22:30,250
What's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?

1262
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:33,950
Jesus Christ, Joe.
Fuckin' forget about it.

1263
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:36,650
It's beneath me.
I'm Mr. Pink. Let's move on.

1264
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:39,650
I'll move on
when I feel like it.

1265
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:42,650
Do all you guys
got the goddamn message?

1266
01:22:44,350 --> 01:22:48,350
I'm so goddamn mad hollerin'
at you guys, I can hardly talk.

1267
01:22:49,650 --> 01:22:51,750
Let's go to work.

1268
01:22:51,850 --> 01:22:54,650
Let's go over it.
Where are you?

1269
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:58,350
I stand outside and guard the door.
I don't let anybody go in or out.

1270
01:22:59,050 --> 01:23:01,250
- Mr. Brown.
- He waits in the car.

1271
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:04,850
I give him the signal,
he pulls up in front.

1272
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:07,150
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue.

1273
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:10,850
Crowd control. They handle
the customers and the employees.

1274
01:23:10,850 --> 01:23:14,050
- That girl's ass.
- Sittin' right here on my dick.

1275
01:23:16,550 --> 01:23:18,550
Myself and Mr. Pink?

1276
01:23:18,650 --> 01:23:22,750
You two take the manager
and make him give you the diamonds.

1277
01:23:22,850 --> 01:23:24,950
We're there
for those stones, period.

1278
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:28,550
Since no display cases are being
fucked with, no alarms should go off.

1279
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:32,750
We're out in two minutes,
not one second longer.

1280
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:36,950
What if the manager
won't give you the diamonds?

1281
01:23:37,950 --> 01:23:41,450
A store like this
is insured up the ass.

1282
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:44,450
They're not supposed to give you
any resistance whatsoever.

1283
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:48,250
If you get a customer or an employee
who thinks he's Charles Bronson...

1284
01:23:48,350 --> 01:23:50,750
smash their nose with your gun.

1285
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:53,250
Drops him right to the floor.
Everyone jumps.

1286
01:23:53,350 --> 01:23:56,350
He falls down screaming,
blood squirts out of his nose.

1287
01:23:56,350 --> 01:23:59,350
Freaks everybody out.
Nobody says fuckin' shit after that.

1288
01:24:00,450 --> 01:24:02,950
Some bitch might
talk shit to you.

1289
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:06,950
Give her a look like she's next.
Watch her shut the fuck up.

1290
01:24:08,150 --> 01:24:10,750
If it's the manager,
that's different.

1291
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:13,150
The managers know not
to fuck around...

1292
01:24:13,150 --> 01:24:15,450
so if he's giving you static...

1293
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:19,750
he probably thinks he's a real cowboy
so you gotta that bastard in two.

1294
01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:23,750
If he won't tell ya something,
cut off one of his fingers.

1295
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:27,150
The little one.
Then tell him his thumb's next.

1296
01:24:27,150 --> 01:24:30,150
After that he'll tell you
if he wears ladies underwear.

1297
01:24:34,150 --> 01:24:36,050
I'm hungry.
Let's get a taco.

1298
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:52,650
Fuck.

1299
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:12,950
Jesus.

1300
01:25:13,050 --> 01:25:15,250
I'm blind, man.
I'm fuckin' blind.

1301
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:17,750
No, you just got
blood in your eyes.

1302
01:25:30,850 --> 01:25:32,250
Is he dead?

1303
01:25:33,650 --> 01:25:35,550
Did he die or not?

1304
01:25:36,750 --> 01:25:38,150
Let's go.

1305
01:26:12,850 --> 01:26:15,150
Hold it! Get out!

1306
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:18,750
Get out of the fuckin' car!

1307
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:36,450
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Larry.

1308
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:39,450
I can't believe she killed me.

1309
01:26:39,550 --> 01:26:41,050
Who'd have fucking thought that?

1310
01:26:41,050 --> 01:26:43,750
Hey, just cancel that shit
right now.

1311
01:26:43,850 --> 01:26:46,750
You're hurt.
You're hurt real fuckin' bad.

1312
01:26:46,850 --> 01:26:48,550
But you ain't dying.

1313
01:26:49,850 --> 01:26:52,850
All this blood's scaring
the shit out of me, Larry.

1314
01:26:54,150 --> 01:26:56,050
I'm gonna die.
I know it.

1315
01:27:31,150 --> 01:27:32,650
What the fuck happened?

1316
01:27:32,650 --> 01:27:36,650
He slashed the cop's face, cut off
his ear and was gonna burn him alive.

1317
01:27:37,950 --> 01:27:40,150
What? I didn't hear you.

1318
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:41,650
I said...

1319
01:27:43,450 --> 01:27:45,050
Blonde went crazy.

1320
01:27:45,150 --> 01:27:50,450
He slashed the cop's face, cut off
his ear and was gonna burn him alive.

1321
01:27:50,450 --> 01:27:51,750
This cop?

1322
01:27:56,850 --> 01:27:58,850
He went crazy?
Something like that?

1323
01:27:58,950 --> 01:28:01,050
Worse or better?

1324
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:04,350
Eddie, he was
pulling a burn, man.

1325
01:28:05,550 --> 01:28:07,550
He was gonna kill
the cop and me.

1326
01:28:07,650 --> 01:28:11,550
When you guys walked in, he was gonna
kill you and run with the diamonds.

1327
01:28:12,150 --> 01:28:13,250
What'd I tell ya?

1328
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:16,850
That sick piece of shit
was a stone-cold psycho.

1329
01:28:16,950 --> 01:28:20,150
You should've asked the cop,
not just killed him.

1330
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:23,950
He talked about what he was gonna do
when he was slicing him up.

1331
01:28:25,450 --> 01:28:27,150
I don't buy it.

1332
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:28,650
Doesn't make sense.

1333
01:28:32,950 --> 01:28:35,450
Makes perfect fuckin' sense
to me.

1334
01:28:35,550 --> 01:28:39,050
You didn't see how he acted
during the job. We did.

1335
01:28:39,150 --> 01:28:41,350
He's right.
The ear's hacked off.

1336
01:28:41,450 --> 01:28:45,550
Let me just say this out loud,
'cause I wanna get this straight.

1337
01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:48,550
You're saying that Mr. Blonde...

1338
01:28:48,550 --> 01:28:49,750
was gonna kill you...

1339
01:28:49,850 --> 01:28:53,050
and then when we got back
he was gonna kill us...

1340
01:28:53,050 --> 01:28:55,050
take the diamonds and scram.

1341
01:28:55,050 --> 01:28:58,250
I'm right about that, right?
That's your story?

1342
01:28:58,950 --> 01:29:00,850
I swear on my mother's soul...

1343
01:29:00,950 --> 01:29:02,550
that's what happened.

1344
01:29:03,550 --> 01:29:06,550
The man you killed
just got released from prison.

1345
01:29:06,650 --> 01:29:09,650
He got caught at a company warehouse
full of hot items.

1346
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:12,350
He could've fuckin' walked.

1347
01:29:12,450 --> 01:29:16,650
All he had to do was say my dad's name,
but he didn't; he kept his mouth shut.

1348
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:19,750
He did his fuckin' time
like a man.

1349
01:29:19,850 --> 01:29:22,150
He did four years for us.

1350
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:24,650
So, Mr. Orange...

1351
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:27,750
you're telling me
that this good friend of mine...

1352
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:30,550
who did four years
for my father...

1353
01:29:30,650 --> 01:29:35,550
who, in four years, never made a deal,
no matter what they offered him...

1354
01:29:35,650 --> 01:29:38,750
you're telling me that
now that he's free...

1355
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:41,750
and we're making good
on our commitment to him...

1356
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:46,450
he's just gonna decide,
out of the fucking blue...

1357
01:29:46,550 --> 01:29:48,450
to rip us off?

1358
01:29:50,150 --> 01:29:53,450
Why don't you tell me
what really happened.

1359
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:55,250
What the hell for?

1360
01:29:56,350 --> 01:29:58,250
It'd just be more bullshit.

1361
01:30:00,450 --> 01:30:02,450
This man set us up.

1362
01:30:03,650 --> 01:30:06,750
Dad, I'm sorry,
but I don't know what's happening.

1363
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:10,550
- It's all right. I do.
- What are you talking about?

1364
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:14,350
That lump of shit's workin'
with the L.A.P.D.

1365
01:30:15,650 --> 01:30:18,950
I don't have the slightest
fucking idea...

1366
01:30:19,050 --> 01:30:20,450
what you're talking about.

1367
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:24,150
Joe, I don't know what you think
you know, but you're wrong.

1368
01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:25,950
Like hell I am.

1369
01:30:26,050 --> 01:30:29,150
Trust me on this.
You've made a mistake.

1370
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:30,950
He's a good kid.

1371
01:30:30,950 --> 01:30:33,550
I understand
you're super-fuckin'-pissed.

1372
01:30:33,650 --> 01:30:35,450
We're all real emotional.

1373
01:30:35,450 --> 01:30:39,750
But you're barking up the wrong tree.
I know him. He wouldn't do that.

1374
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:41,350
You don't know jack shit!

1375
01:30:41,450 --> 01:30:42,550
I do.

1376
01:30:42,650 --> 01:30:44,550
The cocksucker
tipped off the cops...

1377
01:30:44,650 --> 01:30:46,750
and got Mr. Brown
and Mr. Blue killed.

1378
01:30:46,850 --> 01:30:49,850
- Mr. Blue is dead?
- Dead as Dillinger.

1379
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:51,950
How do you know all this?

1380
01:30:52,050 --> 01:30:55,450
He was the only one
I wasn't 100 percent on.

1381
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:58,750
I should have my head examined,
going ahead when I wasn't 100 percent.

1382
01:30:58,850 --> 01:31:02,650
- That's your proof?
- With instinct, you don't need proof.

1383
01:31:02,650 --> 01:31:05,050
I ignored it before,
but no more.

1384
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:09,650
Have you lost your fuckin' mind?

1385
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:12,550
I'm not gonna let you make
a terrible mistake.

1386
01:31:12,650 --> 01:31:15,550
Come on, guys.
Nobody wants this.

1387
01:31:15,650 --> 01:31:17,550
We're supposed to be
fuckin' professionals.

1388
01:31:18,450 --> 01:31:20,350
Larry, look...

1389
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:22,350
it's been quite a long time.

1390
01:31:22,450 --> 01:31:23,850
A lot of jobs.

1391
01:31:23,950 --> 01:31:26,950
There's no need for this, man.

1392
01:31:27,050 --> 01:31:29,450
Let's just put our guns down...

1393
01:31:30,650 --> 01:31:32,350
and let's settle this...

1394
01:31:32,350 --> 01:31:34,050
with a fucking conversation.

1395
01:31:34,150 --> 01:31:37,550
Joe, if you kill that man,
you die next.

1396
01:31:37,650 --> 01:31:39,850
Repeat: you kill him,
you die next.

1397
01:31:39,950 --> 01:31:43,250
Larry, we have been friends.

1398
01:31:43,350 --> 01:31:45,450
You respect my dad
and I respect you...

1399
01:31:45,550 --> 01:31:47,450
but I'll put bullets
in you.

1400
01:31:47,550 --> 01:31:49,850
You put that fuckin' gun
down now.

1401
01:31:50,650 --> 01:31:52,950
Goddamn you, Joe...

1402
01:31:52,950 --> 01:31:54,450
don't make me do this.

1403
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:57,150
Larry, you stop pointin' that gun
at my dad!

1404
01:33:43,950 --> 01:33:45,850
I'm sorry, kid.

1405
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:50,150
Looks like we're gonna...

1406
01:33:51,550 --> 01:33:53,450
do a little time.

1407
01:33:59,950 --> 01:34:01,950
I'm a cop.

1408
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:05,650
Larry...

1409
01:34:06,950 --> 01:34:08,850
I'm sorry.

1410
01:34:10,050 --> 01:34:11,850
I'm...

1411
01:34:11,850 --> 01:34:14,050
so sorry.

1412
01:34:16,850 --> 01:34:19,350
I'm a cop.

1413
01:34:36,350 --> 01:34:37,850
I'm sorry.

1414
01:34:49,550 --> 01:34:51,050
I'm sorry.

1415
01:34:52,650 --> 01:34:54,250
I'm...

1416
01:34:54,350 --> 01:34:55,650
sorr--

1417
01:34:58,350 --> 01:34:59,450
Freeze!

1418
01:34:59,550 --> 01:35:01,550
Drop the fucking gun, buddy!

1419
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:03,550
- Now!
- Put the gun down!

1420
01:35:03,550 --> 01:35:06,450
- Don't do it!
- Drop the gun, man!

1421
01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:09,750
- Drop the fucking gun!
- We're gonna blow you away!
